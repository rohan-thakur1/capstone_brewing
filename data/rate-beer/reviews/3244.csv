Couleur orangé bien pâle et très trouble. Une mousse blanche, que dis-je? Une crème blanche recouvre se liquide. Une mousse voir sans bulle tellement que cest microscopique. Beaucoup de lie, même bien présente dans la mousse. Wow cest donc bien jolie... Un beau 10/10 pour la présentation du liquide. Merveilleux! Une mousse qui persiste en gardant sa consistance! Une mousse qui a le look dun yaourt vanille parsemé de fines particules de canelles. 

Au nez, ça dégage de fortes odeurs de levure belge, dagrumes et de grosses notes florales (à pétales blanches; amélanchier et le lis on dirait) et des vapeurs de miel flottent sur le dessus.

En bouche, une explosion de céréale dès lentrée suivit de levures belge qui enveloppe le palais jusquà tant que cette amertume nettoie le palais! Une sensation de sécheresse par la suite, je me croirait dans le désert! À chaque gorgée, ou presque, les saveurs ne sont pas identiques. Un fort goût dorange, dépices (poivre et coriandre), de jus de banane, de sucre. Plus elle se réchauffe, plus la chaleur de lalcool se fait sentir tout en douceur!

Very strong retention.Brett! and lots of it, in the nose. Light perfume, light band aid and lots of fruity esters to match; nectarine, pear, apple. Delicate honey, seemingly nicely attenuated lies behind it. Its joined by black pepper and just a hint of marmalade. Wow, this is one of the better ""Trippels"" Ive had, though its not really a trippel. No big breadiness, absolutely no clove. Not even all that yeasty, in comparison to most other trappist beers. No alcohol or flaw.Fruity, dry and with enough residual base malt to provide a soft, but not too soft, texture. Some light graininess and lots of ester character, with moderate bitterness, lots of black pepper phenol and easygoing, lightly funky brett notes (light lime, hickory, band aid). Tight, natural carbonation is very high, and needs time to breath. A bit of sharpness and alcohol on the end, mixed in with the big ester character, but its not really problematic. Nice honeyish malt, grain and light brett lingering.Looks like this one has gone downhill in recent years...so I probably just let my memories rest on this older bottle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3244,"2016-10-02",5.0,"A chaque ouverture sinstaure un véritable rituel. On ne déguste pas une Westmalle Triple comme une quelconque bière. Dès son service, la solanité sinstalle. Cest avec un profond respect pour le travail des moines trappistes et une attente tout juste contenue que lon déverse alors le nectar dans son calice. La bière est magnifique, dun blond dorée, tout juste troublée par un léger voile, elle est pourvue dune mousse blanche blanche, d1 cm dépaisseur. Leffervescnce, bien dosée, complète sa majestuosité.
Le nez pose dès lors les bases de la bière : Force, équilibre, complexité. Les flaveurs de céréales, de coriandre, caramel avec une pointe citronnée sentremellent à merveille, et lalcool présent avec des notes de girofles, lui confère une belle intensité. La dégustation tant attendue peut commencer. Lattaque est souple et soyeuse, avec des arômes de céréales, caramel et doranges confites. A partir de ce moment, la symphonie peut débuter. Lamertume telle des cuivres puissants, donne la base de la mélodie. Celle ci est majestueuse, ample et profonde. Les arômes doranges, de girofles et de fruits confits prédominent. Mais les cordes et les vents sentremellent pour donner des variations et des contre mélodies de toute splendeur et sans fin. Des notes épicées, herbacées, de caramel,candi ou de vanille se succèdent et sallient dans une parfaite hamonie. La corpulence est exceptionnelle et le final, très long, laisse sexprimer complètement le houblon. La maîtrise de lart brassicole des moines de labbaye de Wesmalle est sans faute.

The carbonation is soapy and foamy with a slick, creamy texture. The medium body is flavored with mild clove, light lemon, and bread that finishes crisp with an brief, intense clove that turns to banana and has a mild, lingering clove and light metallic note.

3244,"2015-01-07",4.5,"This is the best of the Trappists beers that Ive tried. It is very consistent. This amber brown mixture is generously heady and sparkling with just the right amount of fizz- not all punk-like but rather solid and mellow. I find the texture quite smooth and the taste lightly sweet with a medium hint of caramel. What is surprising it that the brew ebbs away from the other characteristics of Trappists beers with their certain presence of bitter hops. I appreciate that this brew is refreshing, and lovely in its essence. The slightly caramel and apricot taste on my tongue feels great.","Maryland, USA","9er"

3244,"2014-11-27",4.0,"The Belgian-style Tripel Ale is one of my favorite beer styles, and believe it or not, I actually have never had Westmalle Tripel before now. It receives rave reviews and many consider it the best of the style. I wouldnt go that far, though I can definitely see how people would come to that consensus. Its classic Trappist all the way and definitely epitomizes the style. It is not quite the best-ever example of it, however.

I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a Trappist chalice. It had a best before date of 12/12/15 and cost $6.29 ($0.56 per ounce).

Appearance: Pale orange/golden hue over a hazy body. Spastic carbonation is visible and it never settles down. Pours to a two-finger, white, soapy head which never dissipates and leaves plenty of lacing.

Smell: Potent aroma of white grape, or even white wine per se. Not much in the way of spice or banana, though.

Taste: You know youre drinking an authentic Trappist brew when the beer lights up your tongue with a spicy sensation immediately. Though it smells of white grape, Westmalle Tripel tastes more of pepper, flaked maize, and a hint of banana (though none of those ingredients are actually in there  its all yeast esters). A slight juicy sensation through the middle, followed by candy-like sensation of butterscotch and caramel (and no, its not diacetyl). I was hoping for banana and citrus flavors, but they didnt seem to appear. Its not so much bitter per se as it is spicy, though its a pleasant despite being rather intense. Id be curious to try a fresher vintage since this style doesnt usually improve with age. An older bottle, at the very least, is still going to deliver for the style, though.

Drinkability: If you want a beer with a truly intense carbonation mouthfeel, youll find it in a Trappist brew. Westmalle Tripel doesnt have a viscous mouthfeel, though it has enough intense micro carbonation to really give it some presence on the tongue. At 9.5% ABV theres some mild warming sensation, though its easily tolerable. Its one of the driest beers I can recall, as the peppery character seems to suck all the moisture out of the mouth as it goes down. Some carbonation tends to get caught in the throat, but thats to be expected.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

T: Complex as the nose. Very spicy. Sweet malts upfront followed by a stingy hops bitterness. BTW, wonderful bitterness. Fresh malts and citrus hops. Orange zest, vanilla and liquor. In overall, despite of the fruity and sweet upfront, its taste is quite dry and bitter. Just perfect
M: Heavy creamy body and low carbonation. Dry bitter aftertaste and presence of alcohol
O: A world class beer, no more, no less. Expected Trappist quality. Mandatory to beer lovers

Si avvertono vari gusti, tutti in armonia tra loro: il maltato, il miele, il fruttato, ma anche del buono e inaspettato luppolo che li da molta classe e particolarità. Il guaio è che, man mano che la bevi, senti sempre più solo un sapore (quello del luppolo); un buon sapore, certo, ma mi è molto dispiaciuto che quella sinfonia si sapori iniziali scomparisse in questo modo. Anche il retrogusto cambia: man mano che la bevi diventa sempre più amaro. Il corpo è decisamente strutturato. Lalcool non lo senti durante la bevuta, ma alla fine ti presenta il conto.

3244,"2014-05-04",3.2,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance started out closer to a 3 finger white foamy head that quickly settled to a one and a half finger head and held adequately for a good ""tripel."" It had a good hazy yellow/golden orange colored body with a fair amount of stringy lacing a bit all over the place.
The smell had some slight wheat, nice fruity (probably closer to a ""pear"" aroma), and a bit of yeast.
The taste was a wheaty maltiness with a slightly yeasty iciness I get when I normally do most tripels, yeasty wheat aftertaste, dry finish.
On the palate, it sat super dry, wow, never had a dry tripel, but ok, no worries, honestly really doesnt affect much in my opinion, but probably about a medium in body, fairly sessionable. Carbonation seems good for the style and for me.
Overall, this was kinda wheaty for a tripel, but hey whos complainin, good tripel that I would have again, get it if you see it.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3244,"2014-03-01",3.9,"11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass.

A: Pours a hazy golden amber color with lots of carbonation. The head - at one finger high, with a barely off-white shade - features excellent retention, a frothy texture, and great lacing.

S: Wow, this smells like a fantastic pilsner...except its an ale...and its 9.5%...and its a year old. Aside from the surprisingly sturdy level of noble hopping, it also has a wonderful black pepper tone. There isnt much in the way of fruity esters, though - maybe theres a wisp of white grape here and there. Like many trappist ales, its hard to really fathom why it works...and yet, it works so damn brilliantly.

T: It opens up with some notes of apple skin and white grape, while the finish is peppery and slightly hoppy. Occasionally a touch of cherry will appear. While I think the flavors are damn good, theres a reason thats all I wrote about the flavor profile...because it lacks some complexity. Its not dead simple though - and it definitely improves while sitting in the glass - but you dont get the typical twists and turns you do with, say, Rochefort 10.

M: The feel is heavy yet fizzy. And like a good tripel, theres nothing to suggest its 9.5%. Given the fact that its dry as shit and very well attenuated, this goes down with ridiculous ease.

O: I kind of wanted more depth, but as a means of creating an easy drinker without much palpable booze, its a roaring success. I think the fact that Im not a huge tripel fan has something to do with me not giving this some score well over 4+ (like Im wont to do with anything made by monks in Belgium). Id also love to compare it side-by-side with La Fin Du Monde.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Palate experience reinforces the impression as it gives an initial oily almost creamy mouthfeel with lively carbonation and a strong body followed by a long, dry aftertaste caused both by hop bitterness and alcohol.

3244,"2013-08-11",4.0,"Quite a striker. Esters, fruits, alcohol and belgian yeast in aroma, gold, hazy appearance, although poured from above the yeast sediment. The first thing that hits you when tasting is alcohol not really counter balanced with anything in the glass, maybe carbonation is one of these things, but not too successful I would say. Whats also there is the full range of belgian yeast flavors - fireworks of fruitness, herbs and vanilla. The head at first is quite large bubbled and quickly disappears but stays as minimal layer to the end of the glass. Surprisingly the beer has significant bitter finish, quite unusal for tripels, but I do really enjoyed it as it was smooth, by no means overwhelming. A very good tripel, worth coming back to it.","Tarnow, POLAND","Moscicki"

Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, lemon, pepper, clove, banana, bread, candi sugar, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with an outstanding malt/spiciness balance with spiciness being over malt; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

Good, creamy mouthfeel, semi-sweet mid-palate, with a bit of bitterness that drys out on the finish. Not the absolute best, though close to the top.

De brouwerij ligt op een steenworp van mijn woonplaats en het geeft mee toch wel met enige trots dat ik streekbier maar al te vaak bestel op café of op mijn boodschappenlijst zet. Het aroma is zacht bitter met en subtiele toets van banaan en citroen. Het bier is goud blond en in het bijpassend glas komt de onregelmatige en volle schuimkraag compleet tot zijn recht.Het mondgevoel is vol en licht klevend in de keel, maar toch ook sprankelend fris op de tong. Het bruisende bier zoekt zich vlot een weg door de mond en zorgt voor en optimale verdeling van de unieke smaak. De smaak sluit naadloos aan bij het aroma en de geur die je tegemoet komt. Deze valt het beste te omschrijven als fris doch vol, met en fruitige toets van citrus en een subtiele tint van banaan afkomstig van de hoge gisting. De afdronk ligt in het verlengde van elke slok en ebt zachtjes weg tegen de volgende slok of het nieuwe glas.Blijft voor mij één van de beste trappisten bieren, daarenboven vlot verkrijgbaar en een gevestigde waarde op de drank kaart van menig restaurant en café.

S - Tangy fruity esters. Pears, apples, grapes, taffy, wheat bread, damp hay, banana liquor, pepper, various unknown spices.

T - Spiced yeast, pears, tangy taffy, acidic and grapes, muted stone fruit. It grows spicier toward the middle with pepper and coriander. Thick pilsener malt, grassy with a citrus bite toward the end. Finishes spicy and dry.

M - Moderate prickly carbonation, heavy side of medium, alcohol is evident but welcomed, dry finish.

Super complex nose. The flavor is is very layered as well but does not match the nose.
I know it sounds cliche, but complex is the main word to describe this beer.

The colour is glowy as a fresh pale orange around Chernobyl.  I definitely suggest to try without the bottom yeast first.

3244,"2013-05-19",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2013 Thank you Bert!  Pours cloudy lemon yellow with a perfect white head of soft foam.  Excellent retention and handsome lace.  This beer glowed in the glass and was perfect to look at.  Nose is banana, apricot, bubblegum, pale malt, lightly yeasty, complex and layered.  Slightly medicinal.  Some floral and hay.  Perfumey with honey and light biscuit.  Theres a quick breath of orange peel and a just enough spice.  Taste follows the nose all the way.  Buoyant on the palate, vivacious, balanced, supple and creamy.  Theres a little clove on the palate that wasnt on the nose as much.  Finishes dry and slightly sticky.

Complex and full of flavours, difficult to pin down.  Some Belgian restaurants will serve this as an alternative to wine with a meal, a role it performs admirably, as it keeps flavour well in the glass.

Pours a hazy straw yellow with a HUGE three finger billowy white head. Absolutely amazing head retention and gobs of lacing once the head finally does fade.

Incredible aroma of yeast and clove along with peaches and some bubblegum. Quite spicy but light and almost tropical at the same time. There is some light bread and vanilla as well. A touch of dark fruit and flowers.

Flavor of clove and peaches along with coriander and orange peel. More vanilla and tropical fruit along with a very light touch of biscuit. More perfume and flowers along with a breath of alcohol leading to a warmth in the chest. Very dry mouthfeel that finishes with just a slight bit of stickyness.

3244,"2013-04-26",4.7,"330ml bottle bought at Belgian Beer Intl. in Tsuen Wan.
Cloudy hazy golden honey colour with small trunks of dirt like yeast sediments; Two finger head with lasting white crumpet foams; Very sticky lacing and fizzy carbonation; Very fragrant aroma which can be smelt half a foot away, which includes banana, vanilla, caramel, plum, dark fruit, malt, spices and white wine, and hint of alcohol; Rich and fulfilling sweet taste of banana, caramel, burnt toffee, dark fruit, malt, liquorices, citrus, lime, herbal hops, and warming alcohol; Medium body, rich and creamy palate; Taste profile is dominated by very nice, sweet and hoppy Tripel taste, all in a nicely-managed, warm and  comforting alcoholic background, with a distinctive hop bitterness lingered and rounds out for an enjoyable finish; Pretty dry after taste, easy and tempting to mouth.

Comments: After experienced a few Tripel near misses (Waterloo Tripel 7, Delirium Tremens) and never was (La Trappe Tripel), this one boldly states what an excellent Tripel should be: beautiful colour and looks, great lacing, complex and fragrant aroma, and most importantly, sweet and hoppy enough taste to make me swoon. Words simply fails how nice this Tripel is. I say it has a slight edge over Chimay White, the standard bearer of excellent Tripel. Look no further! :)","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

In the glass, aroma is yeasty, spicy, and richly malty. Initial impression is malty, which transitions to a dry sweetness, alcohol, spice and a hint of hops - very nicely balanced. Mouthfeel seems full at first but dries quickly as the carbonation, alcohol, and spicy flavors sweep in. Overall a fantastic balance, and its easy to see why this beer defines the Tripel style.","USA","cladinshadows"

3244,"2013-03-08",4.4,"Beautiful beer to pour; golden with a dense head. Slightly hazy (I might have agitated the yeast a little before pouring; a normal pour of this beer is quite clear) but clear enough to see the high carbonation. The head laces beautifully on the glass. Not a strong aroma, certainly no strong hop aromatics. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy, probably from the thick, foamy head. Taste is extremely bitter in the back - too bitter for me. Bitterness along the sides of your tongue which becomes a sour back of the throat after swallowing. Toasty barley, earthy, and green grass flavors over the hard palate. 

If you like hop bitterness or the earthy tones of triple fermentation on sediment, this beer is not to be missed! Also a great choice for American IPA fans who want to experiment. Perhaps the quintessential Belgian Trappist ale.","North Rhine-Westphalia, GERMANY","ohthehugemanaT"

3244,"2012-12-04",4.6,"75cl bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. Westmalle Tripel is a hazy pale yellow beer with a moderate white head.

Fruity and spicy accents. Moderately bitter finish. Excellent beer, one of my favorites.","","MarcV"

Alcohol up front on first taste, slight burn that detracts from the malt/hop flavor.   Having had this brew at Café Trappisten in 2004 across the street from the Westmalle Abbey, anything less is just... less.

Fruity with a mainly apple smell coupled with a little bit of lemon. There is a lot of spice initially and although not an intense aroma it is a noticeable one. I can detect some pear, yeast and some grain to but everything is very well balanced aroma wise.

Golden orange colour with a huge, three fingers width head that is quite bubbly looking and gradually reduces in size over the course of about five minutes but stops after losing only half its size.

Mix of apples and pears along with a lot of yeast and sugar that combine to make a very sweet, almost cider like drink. There is some lemon and citrus along with a lot of spice and overriding sweetness.

Spicy and quite dry as you would expect but other than that the alcohol is well hidden in this one. There is medium to high carbonation along with full and creamy body.

Alcohol content was very well hidden. The aroma was a little weak but very nice nonetheless and the taste was similar but slightly more pronounced. This one was a great beer that had a good balance.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"
3244,"2012-10-18",4.5,"(From notes 16 Oct, 2012) Bottle. The head is white and very compact; good retention and leaves a thick white blanket on the surface. Color is a clear golden. Aroma is a bit flowery hops, grass, the slightest hint of manure (in a positive way, strangely enough). Overall, the aroma is great, invoking some mental images of its origin. Cant say much about the flavors, except that there is a good balance between malt and hops; not too sweet and not too bitter. Same goes for the finish, which is long and balanced. Mouthfeel is quite creamy, even though the carbonation is average (bubbles are noticeable).This is not the first time Ive had this, and surely not the last. You can find Westmalle Tripel on the crappiest beer menus in Belgium (I had this in an Irish pub) and probably abroad also.

(Fresh) Bottle at North Bar, Leeds. Pours a pale straw yellow, big bubbly head. Aroma is classic tripel - banana yeast, a little citrus, a little spice. Taste is similar - soft banana, a little caramel, classic Belgian yeast, a touch of lemon and orange. Average mouthfeel/body, but suffers from the classic tripel problem of overcarbonation - lifts too much of the beer off the tongue, lessening the taste. Not at all bad, but not outstanding.
7, 3, 7, 2, 16 = 3.5. Rated Oct 2011.

Aged bottle (at least 12 years) courtesy of Zak Avery, as thanks for redecorating the Beer Ritz window display. What an utterly, utterly profound change. This is hardly the same beer. Pours a honeyish amber with a ust a ring of white head. So much going on in the aroma - honey, lemon, lemsip, apricot, pineapple juice, toffee apples, sherbet. Taste, though, is remarkably mellow. Apricot, honey, touch of menthol, caramel, lemon, a bit of booze (that doesnt burn). Feels amazing on the tongue, receding from it, leaving a subtle sweetish linger. And, after 12 years, the overcarbonations been sorted! Leaves just a prickle. Utterly, utterly incredible, one of the absolute best Ive ever had.

Dabord, si vous louvrez sans précaution, elle éclate et déborde comme une fontaine !!
Ensuite, dans le goût, cest larchétype des bières triple...
Noublions pas quhistoriquement Westmalle a été le premier à proposer la dénomination
de triple, et quil la mise en pratique de façon extraordinaire. 
Enfin, nous avons affaire à une triple à 9,5 % abv, ce qui relève dune diablerie du tonnerre.
Donc on  verse prudemment le liquide dans un très beau verre calice de la marque...
On admire la couleur jaune dorée sombre.
Le liquide pétille comme un champagne de la meilleure culture.
La luminosité est très belle mais pas brillante.
La mousse est bien formée et un peu vaporeuse.
Quelle admirable bière dans votre calice . une véritable bénédiction...
Puis on y porte le nez pour respirer des odeurs de citron première classe, de mangue et
de clou de girofle. Le tout nappé dans des céréales...
On porte maintenant les lèvres sur la coupe, et on savoure la texture crémeuse à souhait.
Le premier goût est sur lamertume de la girofle bien fondu dans des céréales maltées,
avec de la prune en primeur et du houblon fleuri. On croit rêver...
La 2ème bouche est sur lorge, la banane flambée, avec une pointe de gâteau de Savoie.
La 3ème est sur la pivoine, le sureau et le pain grillé, avec un équilibre céréales/houblon
extraordinaire et strictement propre à cette bière.
La levure est superbe, fine, souple et crémeuse. Noublions quelle sera la souche dautres
bières de premier niveau.
Le suivi est bien marqué et fortement soutenu par les 9,5 abv. Alcool fort certes, mais nuancé.
La finale est un feu dartifice sublime de saveurs, de nuances et déquilibre. 
Un sommet de lart brassicole. 
Je cote sur la base de 5 , mais comme cest une triple, cest un triple 5 ... donc 555 sur 100 !

If you take it too cold, you?ll get nothing but alcohol and hops, so be sure to let it warm up before drinking.

3244,"2012-05-14",4.2,"Aug 2008: Normal brown 33cl bottle. This one has been hanging around my garage for a couple of years or so. It had been left with a few other goodies boxed up waiting for me to break open when my regular beer stock began to shrink a bit. Best before 30th Oct 2008, so fairly old I guess and ready to go!

Poured into my Westmalle Trappist Challice (what else would you use, if you had one?).

I tried to pour it without getting any sediment into the glass, but I got excited and the whole bottle ended up within the challice. A few bits floated around in a golden hazy cloud of beer. On top sat a thin covering of white bubbles, which were forever being replenished by a rising torrent of other bubbles.

The aroma is all about degrees of sourness and how your nose picks it out. Fruit smells range from Gooseberries to Grapefruit through the spectrum of fruity colours available to man.

The taste is a explosion of flavours, fizzy and different. A bitter sweet mix of the best Belgium has to offer in a glass of Tripel.

The alcohol is evident throughout, but it doesnt detract from the overal complexity and pleasure this beer seems to exude.

I picked this beer up on the recommendation of the woman at a bottle shop in Belgium (store description and location, below). This woman is a saint! What a great recommendation.

Appearance: (5.0) The tulip glass looked amazing with the gold color of the beer and eggshell head from the Triple.

Smell: (5.0) Hints of citrus, a little pepper and some apple. As the beer warmed, the smell became more pronounced.

Taste: (5.0) A good spice came through ... very nice. A small amount of alcohol.

Mothfeel (5.0) Good malt with slight carbination. 

Overall (5.0) This must be the gold standard for all Belgian beers. 

*** Le Moine Austère ***
Just up the road from us in Beligum, is a wonderful bottle shop called the Austere Monk (Ill review it after BA adds it: Le Moine Austère, Rue Dorez 8, Tournai, Belgium) (a review: http://www.monnuage.fr/point-d-interet/le-moine-au My wife and kids found the shop while touring the Grand Place and visiting the Christmas village. The family was excited to bring me to the store and even sent a few photos of the wall of bottles. 

As I looked at the selection, I instantly wished that I knew more about Belgium beers. I understand a little French and shopkeeper was willing to bring to me some of the local beers and the traditional favorites. (Side note: it is *very* helpful to have a wife that speaks and understands French!) She pointed out which beers were still made by monks (down to five, she said), and those breweries which tend to create craft beers. She loves to make gift baskets, filled with beers, glasses and other treats. I cant wait to return!

3244,"2012-05-07",3.9,"(First Taste, Home, 330mL Bottle, Vintage July 2011, Tulip, 9.5% ABV, Cellar Temp, 07/05/2012. #37.


Appearance (4/5): Pours a slightly hazy (but surprisingly clear for a Trappist ale) light golden yellow with a frothy, white, one finger, lasting head with decent lacing. A little sediment.

Aroma (8/10): Dominant yeasty cheese and barnyard notes, clove, cinnamon, and cardamom spiciness, and lemony citrus, with toffee, perfume, and spruce notes.

Taste (8/10): Very spicy and smoothly bitter with yeasty undertones. Still has the sweet opening youd expect from an abbey ale, but quite muted. Has a salty/savory finish. Alcohol is definitely present on the tongue.

Palate (4/5): Medium/full body, lively carbonation, oily texture that has a slick, dry finish. Warming and satisfying. Very smooth. The saltiness adds a bit of substance.

Overall (17/20): Pretty good. Not exactly my favorite Trappist beer, but it does well and has a unique savory note that isnt at all unpleasant. Reminds me a little of Dieu du Ciels Blanche Neige for some reason. Good for cold weather. 

Drinkability: 3/5. Character: 4/5. Buy Again: Probably No.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","jrizko"

3244,"2012-02-23",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 4/19/2010.  Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip.

Quite a luxurious appearance! Even with a gentle pour, a magnificent 3 inch white head formed in my tulip. A small dark brown dab of sentiment came out and rests delicately on top. The bright, full golden color is nearly transparent, and the re-energizing carbonation from the bottom dances with the small yeast particles, creating a snow globe effect. Great head retention and tons of sticky lace down the sides of the glass. 

Bready malt, crisp green apples, along with some mild spiciness in the nose. Alcohol is definitely present, more so as it warms.

Crisp green apples and white grape skin create a slightly tart first impression. Pale malt, honey, and a warming alcohol presence arrive next, bringing a complex spice mixture as well. Dextrin sweetness is unable to mask a slightly medicinal / alcohol flavor at the end.

Crisp, with above average carbonation. Slight tartness inspires salivation, furthering the desire for the next sip. Finishes dry.

3244,"2011-09-11",3.6,"[330ml bottle, gift from Jim] Do not allow your hands to tremble even slightly whilst pouring this one, for it is full of annoyingly bouyant chunks of sediment desperately fighting to get into your glass.  Assuming you are successful, youll have a clear, deeep gold beer with a huge fluffy white head and a lot of fizz.  A strong smell of yeast and bread wafts from the glass.  Theres some bread in the flavour too, but its predominantly spicy - ginger, and maybe some coriander.  Grassy hops come through, but dont disguise the obvious alcohol.  Theres a hint of banana and a mild, but lasting earthy bitterness  in the finish, leaving your mouth feeling a little sticky but also a little dry.  However, the fizz is very annoying - it offers annoying prickles rather than the nice fluffiness of some Belgian beers - and meant this fell short of many other Trappist beers.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

3244,"2011-08-21",3.7,"Poured from a bottle into a trappist glass. Appearance is a hazy copper to gold with a thin head of white foam. Nice carbonation bubbles constantly flowing up from the bottom of the glass. The thin white cap of foam just sits atop the beer refusing to budge. Aroma consists of sweet esters, banana, cloves, bubblegum, cinnamon, and a light, floral alcohol note shows itself when you dig deep. All of these aromas are just faint whispers, none really announce themselves for the oblivious onlooker. The taste comes next. The first thing to touch my tongue says orange peel pierced with cloves. As this flavor washes over the tongue it gives way to bubblegum and an earthy, spicy alcohol, almost like a rum. As this layer diminishes, bananas make an appearance and seem as though they have been rolled in cinnamon perhaps in preparation of a bananas foster. The finale is abrupt yet subtle. Theres not really any sort of lingering aftertaste, but more a pleasant ""have a nice day"" and then it is gone.

The taste is more conservative, more citrusy and less of a bouquet than the nose led me to expect. It is elegantly bitter with a sour component. The body is medium with high effervescence, resulting in a distractingly fizzy finish that leaves a fruity, slightly bitter aftertaste that I find absolutely pleasant. I dont find this beer to be as boozy as some have pointed out--on the contrary, I think it conceals the alcohol content very well.

3244,"2011-05-20",3.8,"SCHIUMA:
schiuma abbondante, bianca, non finissima abbastanza persistente
COLORE:
oro chiaro con tonalità arancio, leggermente velata

INTENSITA / FINEZZA / AROMA
profuma di frutta matura, con un fondo classico e consistente di lievito, in cui si insinua il malto con note caramello e zucchero, il tutto condito con un profumo alcolico piuttosto evidente.
GUSTO / RETROGUSTO / PERSISTENZA
entra dolce, fruttata, con una coda leggermente acidula, per poi lasciare libero sfogo a sensazioni alcoliche che lottano con un amaro finale abbastanza evidente, che lascia a momenti ritornare il malto in primo piano per poi prendere nuovamente il sopravvento nel restrogusto, con qualche nota speziata.
CORPO / CARBONATAZIONE / CONSISTENZA
copro medio, ben carbonata, da soprattutto sul finale una sensazione alcolica e di calore in gola.
-Buona, godibile con un tasso alcolico elevato ma non fastidioso. Lamaro finale la rende più dinamica, non permettendole di cadere in un dolce noioso. Le sfumatire fruttate ed il classico belgian style sono ben calibrati dando un prodotto completo e di qualità. bevuta accompagnando dei buoni formaggi francesi a pasta molle e con sapori molto intensi. abbinamento ben riuscito, dove ben pochi vini potrebbero reggere il confronto.","(Madrid","molly75"

This beer is unique in every way imaginable. From the taste to appearance and smell. Poured into a big glass youll see the true color of this beer, bright golden-yellow with a slight touch of brown.
The smell is sharp, its just the beginning...
After this delicious golden liquid enters your mouth youll experience thousands of flavoured sensations, one even more exquisite than the last one. Goosebumps start to rise all over your body, your tongue enjoys a tsunami of deliciousness. After youve swallowd and fully tasted this beer youll crave for more.
The best way of consuming a Westmalle Tripel is to serve half a bottle at first, drink it, and then, pour the rest of the bottle -including the yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae)- into your glass, this gives you the ultimate Westmalle Tripel experience, it ads a bitter and very barley-like finishing touch to your aftertaste.
Drinking this beer will truly expand your horizon concerning beer, not only by taste but also, and maybe even more, will provide you with a whole new perspective on this ancient brewers tradition. 
Nothing will be the same anymore. Period.

Al palato ricco e complesso, molto pronunciato, con sentori fruttati (banana), un luppolo vivacissimo e un tocco di malto nel sottofondo. Il corpo è robusto, strutturato e caldo: il luppolo la fa da padrone, in un contesto fruttato, e la potenza dellalcool la completa nel finale.

The aroma teases the imbiber with an undertone that is delicately sweet, nestled beneath a predominant aroma of fresh bread. The palate is oily with a muffled effervescence. The finish borders on slightly chalky. The taste is tantalizingly bitter, with the alluring hint of a flirtatious sweetness, and fresh herbs. Like a number of quadrupel beverages characteristic of the Belgians that I have tried, this libation carries with it the suggestion of anise or liquorice.

Much of the aroma and taste reminds me of cider  maybe apple cider. The nose is dominated by fruity smells  e.g. citrus and apple  along with a mild hint of alcohol and clove. The flavor is essentially the same as the nose, running from a bitter-sour taste in the front and finishing out with an alcohol taste in the back.

3244,"2011-03-19",3.1,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2011 This may be the original tripel, but Im nonetheless a bit disappointed. It looks great, slightly hazy with a medium amber colour and a creamy, white, fully lasting head with plenty of lacing. The aroma is also good: plenty of floral notes, herbs, yeast and pineapple. The taste is initially light bitter with a hint of vanilla sweetness, but then the alcohol kicks inn and threatens to ruin the party: the finish is bitter in an unpleasant way, and the flavour is dominated by the alcohol. In the Chimay Triple the alcohol in the finish creates a warm, mouth warming honey sweetness, but in the Westmalle the alcohol doesnt do anything to enhance the experience.

Theres lots of yeast developed flavor, spice and the higher alcohols.  Very high carbonation.  Creamy, warming (nearly hot), and medium body.

Seems more carbonated than I thought when I opened the bottle. The smell is rather clean with almost fruit like aromas like peach and apple. Some spice in the nose as well along with banana. Pretty high carbonation level that in my opinion somewhat detracts from the flavors. Pretty sweet up front with a mix of booze spicy type flavors. Ends with a lingering bitterness. Ends pretty cleanly. Good lace left on the glass. Overall a surprisingly light bodied, well carbed, nectar that drinks way easier than it should for the amount of alcohol it has.

Can be easily found in supermarkets and bars all over Belgium and is always a great staple to come back to again and again. Comes in a traditional bottle that features a ring with the lettering ""Trappistenbier"" embossed on it. It pours an intense orange with large white foamy head. As soon as you pour it a fruity bouquet of lemon grass, oranges and pineapple envelops your nose. The taste is a continuation of those flavours, all wrapped in a spicy full body with great mouthfeel. Theres spicy hops, coriander, organge peel, some pleasant fruity sweetness and a touch of alcohol. It is brilliantly upfront and assertive and yet very well balanced. Makes you want to move to Belgium just so you can session on that every weekend. Now excuse me while I go open another one.","GERMANY","Case"
3244,"2010-10-01",4.5,"Pours a cloudy green/gold colour with a nice, airy head. Much lighter in colour than my previous trappists. 

Fruitdriven nose, with a component that could remind me of gras as well. Freshly baked cupcakes is also something I´m picking up (the yeast flavour), and a hint of chocolate.

A lovely sweetnes backed up by a big mouthfeel. Bitternes is also present, and a long lasting mouthfeel. Getting a spicy pepper component on the palate in adition to the aromas from the nose. Many layers of goodness in this bottle!

Conclusion
I´m a big fan of trappistbeers, with the ""wide"" variaties you can get from the 7 different monastery´s. This Westmalle gives the category a nice twist with it´s lighter, fresher style, with alot of taste. Would have loved to try this to some asian inspired food!","NORWAY","jikvig"

T: The sugar component is quite strong and provides a great sweetness. Some banana bread sort of flavor along with a light bitterness.

M: The body is medium with a very full carbonation. Despite the sweetness of the beer, theres a nice dryness due to the carbonation.

The mouthfeel is rather light and carried by a high but not over done carbonation.

The taste reveals the real beauty of this beer. Fresh and fruity, more mustiness, alcoholic, tart through the middle, with a hint of absinthe, a crisp dry finish and a quite strong phenolic astringency and woody, clove and cinnamon lingering after.

3244,"2010-08-14",4.3,"11.2 ounce bottled poured into my Chimay Trappist glass.  Im rating a pair of Tripels tonight, this is my second.  This one pours a bright golden color thats hazy in appearance.  Better head than I was expecting, with about a quarter inch of soap suds around the glass.  Some pear and pineapple notes in the nose.  Smells brighter than I thought it would, if that makes sense.  First taste is dry, very dry, with a light mouthfeel and a huge alcohol-infused finish.  As my palate acclimates I get more citrus, specifically lemon and orange, flavors.  Theres some nice things going on with the malt in this beer - its almost sweet, kind of like French bread.  Aside from the obvious alcohol - theres no where for it to hide, after all - theres a nice bright finish to this beer thats somewhat citrusy and grassy.  Its hoppier than I expected, but thats not necessarily a criticism, as I feel its very well balanced.  Some Belgian beers have a tendency to be overly sweet however that is not the case with Westmalle.  Indeed, its dry but not overly so.  The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy but not too watery.

A - Hazy apricot/ honey golden orange color. Fairly large, foamy, pillowy, pearly white head. Decent retention with a thin layer of lace with it being a bit thicker and sticky on the edge.

S - Good amount of peach and apricot along with some golden fruit and citrus. A lot of vanilla and some candi sugar. Touches of pale malt and some spices along with a touch of alcohol.

T - Some citrus and apple taste comes out first. A fair amount of pale malt with some spiced flavors. Mid sip the yeast and spices come out a bit more and some grassy hops. A touch of bitterness along with some sweetness with a candi sugar type of taste. Some alcohol comes out as well.

M - Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Somewhat smooth with a drying finish.

D - Pretty drinkable beer that is has a diversity of flavors. A little more spiced and less sweet, and the ABV limits how much you can drink. However, I would gladly drink this again, and could see myself drinking more than one in a night (sipping them of course).

Notes: Best before 30/09/11. Not as much typical Tripel flavor as I was expecting. This is a bit less sweet and fruity (particularly lacking a stronger peach/apricot taste). A bit more like a BSPA. It is tasty nonetheless though. Solid beer that is an enjoyable drink.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

3244,"2010-03-21",3.6,"Gotta be careful with tripels like this. Despite my efforts to get it into a Trappist glass with that magic one-inch head, every drop of this brew seems to be loaded with dynamite. The thick, white head eventually settles over the cloudy, sediment-whirling (I shook the last of the bottle) orange body and the smell of hay, hops, grapefruit and wine yeast really pours into the room - I can smell this beer from half a meter away! Taste is playful and intricate: strong yeasty notes playing among bitter citrus aromas; the hops carry hints of fresh grapes, pepper and herbs. Spicy and feisty, this is the original ""tripel"", brewed as a counterpart to the heavy, sweet, brown sugar varieties dominating the Trappist ales. The Westmalle does an impressive job at delivering just this, but unfortunately it is simply not my favorite style. The aftertaste is almost painfully dry and yeasty, and without even the mildest hint of malt to round it off this baby is almost too much for me to handle. I did say ""almost"", as the Westmalle Tripel is a very nice brew. Make no mistake about it.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

330 ml bottle with the Trappist collar around the neck. Freshness date (best before 2010-06-30) and glassware recommendations printed on the label.

The pour is orange colored with a two finger ivory-colored sparkling head that settles after a short while but leaves a nice coat of foam.

Pleasant sweet fruit esters (apricots). Earth and dry hay. Pepper, yeast and a gentle sting from the alcohol. The smell is somewhat reminiscent of white wine - very nice.

All in all a rather crisp taste with decent amounts of malts. Plenty of fruits - apricots, some banana, citric notes mostly in the form of lemon, and a vague taste of grapes that strengthens the resemblance of white wine I got from the smell. Rustic honey flavors. Big taste of peppery alcohol and spices. Subdued flavors of earthy yeast. The finish is rather bitter, more so than expected, and has a bold spicy alcohol character that seems to linger on forever.

Medium body that feels a bit sharp due to generous amounts of carbonation that feels very lively in the mouth.

A very good beer and as most Trappist beers, it showcases a very well balanced complexity. The alcohol is perhaps just a little too present, though.

3244,"2009-09-03",4.1,"11.2 oz. bottle purchased at Greens on Ponce De Leon. HUGE fluffy head. The head was ridiculous, but I am all about nice head. Haze gold/orange color. Very nice looking tripel I must say! Not so sure about the aroma. Yeast, and other subtle fruit and spice aromas are starting to surface. The aroma is not extremely pungent or nuanced. A slight fruity/spice aroma. I would say this leans more towards the subtle fruit aroma, but I am not that impressed with the aroma. The flavor is a different story; that subtle fruit aroma becomes a lot more noticeable. The beer is very smooth, but has an annoying carbonation bite at the very end to keep it away from a ""5"" on the palate level for me. Best thing about this beer is the flavor; it has that nice fruit smoothness with a mild spice bite helped by the carbonation. Very nice beer, and at almost 10% ABV , I am enjoying this even more. Pretty nice tripel I must say. This one is not so heavy on the yeast, which is great.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

The taste is smooth, spicy, delicious but not at all strong or sweet like many American tripels I have had. The fact that this is 9.5 ABV and I cant taste it is impressive. This may be the best tripel Ive had so far, more subtle than American tripels.

3244,"2009-07-20",5.0,"Presentation: It was poured from an 11.2oz brown bottle into a goblet. A best before date is printed on the back of the bottle.

Appearance: The body has slightly hazy appearance with a bright golden yellow color. Also there is some nice visible carbonation and lots of little bits of floating yeast in the body. On top sits a tall, stiff, white head that has great retention and make lots of slick lacing that coats the glass before slowly sliding down the sides of the glass.

Smell: The nose is full of fruity and funky yeast, sweet malt and fresh wet hay.

Taste/Mouth Feel: There is mild sweetness from the malt and fruity/funky yeast. There are notes of apple, pineapple, golden raisin and lemon zest that are wrapped up in a mild warming alcohol. Hops are very light and the finish gets slightly tart and dry with just a hint of hop bitterness. The body is about medium to full with a smooth rounded feel and the carbonation is in perfect balance to cleanse the palate for the next sip.

Notes: This is one of the finest beers that I have had in my opinion, and worthy of a perfect score as I cant find anything to improve on except for maybe the yeast sediment in the appearance but I like the yeast in Trappist beers.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

3244,"2009-05-27",4.1,"***May 06 / 08 K, so Im chugging back a 2 yr+ cellared bottle... man, this has really mellowed. Its to the point now where I could drop this back in mere minutes. Mild flavoured as well as in the aroma dept. The harshness of the yeast has really dissapated. Still quite dry and tart (or is that tannic?). Nothing much has change except for the mellowing effect and the fact that now I could chug this. Got another one for the long term cellar experiment. Upped Appearance rating. Great pour, super clear with the cellaring and the concrete sediment on the bottom of the bottle, great effervecance, lacing and incredible retention.... nearing perfection - serious.

***Jan 25 07: Grade bumped up from 3.5. After having a few of these in the last couple of days, the Belgium Tripels (or at least this one) have started to win me over. Ill have to add apples to the aroma list; cinammon to the taste list; mouthfeel - great swish, good initial hard bitter attack and a softer bitter aftertaste that previously noted. Also I think there is also a slight nutty aftertaste too.

***Re-review July 13, 2006: Way way better this time around. Heres the improvements/modifications to the original review: Colour leaning to the orange side and there is a freaking ton of sediment that is small and white leaving a pile at the bottom of my glass. Aroma is very present and quite spicy with the same yeast and a bunch of sweetness (maybe that crummy white grape juice from Welchs). Taste is pretty strong: Lots of bold spiciness, lots of yeast and some things that I have no idea what they are. This time, I love the mouthfeel, although its no easy ride: the harsh yeast, spices and bitterness blend together to create a slight sweet start and a dry finish with a neverending hard bitter aftertaste. The whole time I want to say that I can really notice the alcohol, but it is just the harshness of this beer until the aftertaste - thats where I finally know. Man, This is a pretty harsh beer thats really drinkable.....dont really like it but really like it.?.?.?.?.?.?

Feb 5, 2006: The excitement of this beer vanished the second I tasted it. Great looking hazy yellow and poured up a really thick head which stuck around quite long. Aroma was a bit sour but mainly apricots and yeast. A little bit of light brown sediment remained (almost like really crappy milk chocolate in colour - Im not saying this was a bad think tho..). Suprisingly sour in taste, which was quite terrible, this is unquestionabally the worst Trapist beer Ive ever had. The more I drank, thoughts of pouring it out crept in my mind (total sacrilege!!!). We got his directly form Belguim about 2 weeks ago...it is possible we got bad bottles despite the expiry date being 22/12/07.The Dubbel was better. Extremely dissapointing. Need a bottle from another batch to confirm horrible review.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

3244,"2009-05-09",4.1,"Sensing my melancholy, she came to me one lonely evening with a promise of a better day and a brighter smile. Clear blue skies as far as the heavens, or in her case, vivid hazy gold with heavenly clouds of white decorating her picturesque canvas. Lace paints the sides of my glass, while her nose reaches out to embrace my lost soul in her comforting embrace. Delicately sweet with a pervading sour vibrancy; sourdough, lemon zest, lively yeast and faint grass while cinnamon sticks, coriander, and ginger spice things up. White crackers and vanilla cream filling soften her already airy mouthfeel and palate for a heavenly experience. I have never tasted such a light, effervescent tripel before. Yeast, pepper, coriander, and ginger tingle across my tastebuds as delicate creaminess lingers. Ripe bananas add a bit of meatiness while lemon and grass bitters the back of my throat. As my body warms, her gentle onslaught continues. Never were there a gentler tripel with such warmth of character. Each breath whispers of spices, lemon zest, and ginger while I lick my lips wet with vanilla cream, bananas, and piping fresh sourdough. Smitten, I give up the pen and enjoy the final moments of our time together, eyes closed and heart wide-open.


I really do not like naming favorites, but Westmalle impressed me that very first afternoon with their Dubbel, and their Tripel is no exception. For each tripel I enjoy today and each tripel I shall enjoy tomorrow, I shall always give a silent nod of thanks to those inspired Trappist monks. There is always room for Westmalle in my fridge and in my cellar where she shall watch over her children like a wise mother.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Pours a hazy light straw color, gentle pour still yields some visible sediment and a nice big inch of pillowy head.  Head lasts for a good long time and laces the glass really well.  Light crisp sweet aromas... some light candi sugar, some tropical sweet phenols, and some yeasty twang.  Very nice nose.  Flavor starts with those fruity, boozy phenols, notes of apples and tangerines, grainy yeast tartness.  A slick tamed sweetness throughout- smooth and even.  Some light booze heat shows up throughout.  Very nice, clean flavor.  Palate shows a bit of excessive carbonation, but not enough to detract.  Smooth and full otherwise, with a nice crisp finish.

First thing I notice when I breath in the awesome smell is the citrus and soft fruits. This beer is bursting with fresh and acidic qualities on the nose. Top notes are bready with orange and tangerine peel. Floral, eucalyptus, vanilla, and grapefruit are mid notes. And right down in the Trappist glass is honey, brown sugar, grapefruit and a touch of alcohol. First taste is a sweet punch to the teeth. Just makes you wish every beer was as intense as this beer. Tastes much darker on the palate than what would be expected from the nose. Plums and raisins make a subtle yet lengthy appearance. Citrus shows the whole way through this beer, changing fruit but making its presence felt. Nice spicy finish. Mouth feel is excellent... Its a Trappist, what did you expect?

3244,"2009-03-28",3.9,"Appearance: The Westmalle Tripel pours a slightly hazy golden color  very similar to what youd see from a wheat beer.  As with most of the other Trappist beers, this comes with about three to four solid fingers of light head with minimal lacing that disappears pretty quickly.  You can tell this has a lot of effervescence by the onslaught of small bubbles swimming swiftly to the top of the glass.  

Smell: Just as I had imagined, there is a lot of spice going on in the glass.  There is an immediate blast of beautiful honeycomb that hits you first, and then it is quickly followed by banana and clove components on the backend.  For me, the real joy comes out of feeling like Ive just stuck my nose in the middle of a fresh honeycomb.  On top of what is immediately noticeable, there is a very faint amount of funk that sits way in the back of the nose.  This becomes more evident as the beer begins to warm.   

Taste: I guess one of the best things a beer can do is taste like it smells, and this certainly does just that.  Surprisingly enough the honeycomb component I get on the nose translates into the taste very well.  I also taste the yeast along with the banana and cloves.  In terms of the alcohol, I dont taste it as much as I thought I would but I certainly feel it about halfway through the bottle.  And its a small bottle.  

Mouthfeel: Overall this is an extremely well-balanced beer in the mouth.  Because of the style, the Westmalle has a lot of bite due to the sparkling qualities and the enormous amount of head.  There is a perfect amount of bitterness, too, which is paired with a vigorous amount of acidity.  Normally a beer like this would lean more toward the lighter side, but this one is easily approaching medium body.   

Overall: Lets be honest, this isnt a mind-melting beer.  However, it is classic in just about every way.  I really love the honeycomb component the most and really like the way this baby smells.  I am also a really big fan of the bitterness levels that I get from the Westmalle.  Its not as unique as the Orval (which is still my favorite Trappist ale), but it is definitely a staple and quite enjoyable.  Its proof that consistency is a very good thing.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","amneziak"

Aroma of spcies (particularly clove), lemon/citrus zest, and the typical tripel skunk.  Tastes like...a tripel!  Lots of Belgian yeast and spices, maybe some cinnamon.  As the beer warms some light fruits (especially apple) come out, but you really have to search for it.  Mostly the beer is dominated by spices.  Pretty drinkable as the 9.5% isn’t noticed in the flavor or palate.  Probably my favorite tripel, although this style is one of my least favorite.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"

It smells like a saison to me.  There are hints of fruit and possibly licorice and hay.  It is medium bodied, a bit foamy, very smooth and the finish is clean.  The flavor is peppery and leathery.  It is spicy like clove and coriander.  There is a grassy aspect to the taste.  The flavors are very well blended.

3244,"2008-04-09",4.1,"Pours a peach, orange, perhaps I could call it grapefruit color. Moderate head that tapers off pretty quickly. About a quarter of the way through just a patchy head remains that does produce some lacing. The aroma is pleasant consisting of fruits, some of the sweeter ones such as oranges and some nice yeast. Semi tangy citrus flavor, yeasty and extremely easy drinking. Theres almost a clean watery note mixed in with the fruits. Nice amount of flavor but Im looking for just a little more. Perhaps Im being picky as I recently sampled various brews from St. Bernardus, Chimay and Rochefort but this one does carry the same price tag. I would never have known there was 9.2% alcohol in there if I didnt look at the bottle. Quite refreshing too but if youre drinking this you arent looking for something to slug down while sitting in the sun. As the beer warms it becomes a little more spicy with a sour grapefruit flavor and a banana note I didnt detect earlier but still, I can hardly taste the alcohol.

Very citrusy smell - mostly orange and lemon, which also came through in the taste. A very balanced beer, the high alcohol content is not apparent - be careful.
Pleasant carbonation on the tongue, and a very soft feel.

3244,"2007-10-12",4.0,"THOUGHTS: Incredible. I could barely describe the aroma and flavors because they werent quite like anything I have had before in a beer. Ive had tripels before but this is somehow diffent. While not exactly what I think of as a tripel, it was even better.  A little something in both the flavor and aroma was not pleasant to me, but it was minimal. It was underlying but kept it from being perfect. 
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a cloudy, light to medium amber, with an average, white head that mostly diminished, but did so slowly. The aroma was light malt, light to moderate yeast, along with honey, fruits, spices and a little alcohol. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic, whilte the finish was moderately to heavily sweet and bitter, lightly acidic and sour with an average duration. The flavor was very yeasty and seemingly hoopy toward the finish. The medium body was dry and somewhat syrupy with fizzy carbonation and a metallic and lightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Westmalles Tripel pours a slightly hazy apricot golden with handfuls of tiny carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. A two finger dense white head formed on the pour that had incredible staying power. The rush of carbonation keeps the head strong. Leaves sticky spotty lacing after each swig. Really, a nice looking glass of beer.

The aroma is packed full of fresh ripe golden orchard fruits that are gleaming in the autumn sun. Yellow pears, slightly underipe peaches, and mildly tart green apples all smell fantastic. Theres a hint of clove along with the pale biscuity like malt that makes up the canvas so the fruitiness of this tripel shines through. A sprinkling of candi sugar just sweetens the deal.

Flavor is pretty much in line with the aroma but as it warms I cant help but notice a sweet, but dry, wine like character. Big white grape flavors (not a big wine drinker so not sure of variety). The white grapes go nicely with the orchard fruits and actually take the front seat. Some alcohol warmth on the swallow. Very good.

Medium bodied with a lively carbonation that makes this beer creamy and somewhat frothy as it hits the tongue. Finishes extremely dry. 

Good drinkability for such a high abv. brew. The alcohol will get in the way of this one though as it gets stronger as the beer warms.

An excellent tripel (one of my favorite styles). Up there with the best Ive been lucky enough to sample so far. Unique and very enjoyable.

3244,"2007-09-30",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2016 Quite raisiny wineyness, with a subtle warming malty hug. Quite carbonated, tingles with each taste. Slightly alcoholic, but the alcohol actually helps carry all the other flavours very well - a dry maliness and a resiny bitterness. All very well balanced and almost mellow, and of course certainly winey.
Rerate: 330ml bottle (Drink Baar, Tallinn)
Wonderfully fruity winey aroma. Oh so mellow, but with lovely enlivening, but not crisp, carbonation. What I said before - wow, fruity and winey. OK, 9.5% is clearly not a light drink, but the wineyness is stunning. Oddly, it was served in an orval glass and for one sip I got a magical orval tatse and retronasals fromthis. If this had just a hint more hops this would be stunning.

The taste is intensely coriander and cloves, with doughy malt, zingy citrus tang, celery, and the ever-increasing bitterness of the hops (which are not as intense as this tripels smell would make you think).  The aftertaste was coppery and a bit menthol-like due to the higher alcohol content, but at no point did I ever feel that I was drinking something 9.5%.  Commendable, and, perhaps, dangerous.

3244,"2007-07-19",2.3,"Ok so this started out pouring a golden yellow into my glass with a thick white head but it went away quickly. Aroma is yeast spice (tons of nutmeg for some reason), and alcohol. Now maybe I started this thing too cold but on the first few sips the stuff was nothing but a spicy yeast and alcohol bomb and it was really just not that good. As it warmed the alcohol died down a bit but still not that well and more flavors were released such as a note of lemon zest. Overall, I thought the alcohol was hidden horribly in this beer which is surprising to me because normally high alcohol content does not bother me but for some reason this one did. Oh well, first time that has happened to me, I guess you cant like them all. I am beginning to notice however that triples in general I dont care for that much. Which is again confusing because I love quads and doubles. Hmmm weird.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

This one is deeply complex, tending to the dry side, but with a smooth malt richness that is very satisfying.  Interesting to sip and ponder.

3244,"2007-06-23",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2008 I have two different bottles of this of two different ages. From their website, I understand that the best-before date is three years after the brew date, so they are one and four years old respectively.

I dont have two identical glasses, so the younger beer was in a Leffe glass and the older was in my dear Duvel glass. Served at about 5 degrees - 45 for yanks - and allowed to warm up to more civilised temperatures as we went.                    


Younger:
Appearance: sparkly, thick smooth head, small bubbles. yellow-gold, nice lacing
aroma: peppery, fruity, yeasty notes. good. as it warms, grassy hops coming out mildly - saaz? becomes sweeter and even spicier; becomes less balanced, but richer
flavour: light, peppery, balanced yeast notes. flavour develops well as it warms.
mouthfeel: light, sparkly effervescent
                              

Older:
Appearance: Darker, amber-gold, practically no head, thicker, cloudier. soapy film of head would disappear if not for etching in the duvel glass. no lacing
aroma: heavy, floral, almost cloying. not as nice as the new bottle. as it warms, syrup and floral, candied, gaining a hint of peppery phenolics, nice balance, port-ish now. less cloying than when it was cold. the hops come out more now that its warm, very mellowed, not grassy at all. english?
flavour: sweeter, thicker. not as peppery or sparkly. the fresh-fruitness of the first has become heavier, brandied, syrup. like a nicely aged cream sherry. opens up as it warms. black pepper notes. yeastier. alcohol comes through.
mouthfeel: thicker, heavier, chewy.

Coriander and cloves take the show.  There is a bit of a sweet sugar baby note up front.  There are moments when I think that it comes off as a bit watery, but then that banana clove finish picks up and all my concerns are gone.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
3244,"2007-04-05",3.2,"I was excited to try this beer, as Ive heard a great deal about the Westmalle brewery.  I found this beer to be good, but to be honest found myself making unfavorable comparisons to some other tripels Iike Allagash Tripel Reserve and Tripel Karmeliet due to a very mild flavor and a bit of wateriness in the mouthfeel.

A bottle I picked up from a display at Consumer Beverage in Hales Corners.  This beer pours a hazy dark yellow with lots of soft secondary-fermentation produced head.  Smells tripel-ish with some clove notes and lots of coriander.  Flavor is a bit like a white wine up front, with some spiciness on the back end.  Not as full-flavored as other tripels Ive enjoyed like Tripel Karmeliet, Allagash, and Victory Golden Monkey.  Mouthfeel is quite soft, but a bit thin up-front.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

3244,"2007-04-04",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2008 Second Rating 7/22/2008.  11.2 oz. bottle. I felt like I needed to re-visit this beer since I wasnt all that crazy about it the first time and the average is significantly higher than my rating.  This was a bit of a gusher when I opened the bottle.  A very slow pour into my Chimay chalice revealed an antique gold
beer with a large linen white head that lasted until mid-glass and left surprisingly little lace. The aroma was mostly yeast and alcohol with hints of spice and lemon.  The flavor is again yeast with a strong flavor of alcohol and a stronger spice presence than in the aroma.  There is a definite and distracting alcohol burn at the finish.  No change in my original rating, 
 
Original Rating 4/4/2007. 11.2 oz bottle.  Pours a cloudy honey gold with a thin white head that lasted through most of the glass. Light but pleasant aroma of yeast, green apples and a bit of alcohol.  The flavor was also a bit on the light side I thought with green apples, yeast, and a bit of lemon present in the flavor.

3244,"2007-03-29",4.1,"330ml bottle. Been a long year since ive tried one of these. This particular bottle is best before tommorrow, so I thought why not! Spicy aroma, slightly nutty, buttery, toffee like malts, some fruity phenols from the yeast, nothing too outstanding. Looks great poured out into my Duvel glass. Thick billowing head atop a hazy looking gold body leaving clumps of lace. The body is rich, liqueur-like at times, surupy yet not cloyingling sweet. Im bombarded with notes of cinnamon and apple, peach, apricot and citrus notes, some breadiness, camembert-like cheese mould flavours, all balanced out with good amounts of buttery caramel malts. Alcohol is apparent yet not burning or too warming, merely adding to the body of flavour. Finish lingers, tantilises, slightly drying but begging for another flavour journey. Fantastic brew, glad I got to try it in more ideal circumstances than the first time.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

You just always presume dont you? Anyway, hazy golden colour with a superb and inviting white head. Citric (orange) and spicy nose, maybe some corriander and definite yeast. Rather sweet in the mouth and Im sure a lot of that comes from the alcohol which sadly is way too obvious. Still a bit of a lip smacker there is no doubt.

Pale malting with some definite notes of apricot brandy,.citrus, and great light but substantial peppery hoppiness which lingers well into the warm, pleasant (not too dry, but dry enough) aftertaste. I must admit, I poured a few inches above the glass near the end to get the head going and release some of the carbonation, so this one is not too heavily carbonated at this point (which is perfect) and sports an appropriately present, not too thin body.

3244,"2007-01-27",3.6,"12 oz bottle, via Zathrus13.  Pours a mostly clear yellow gold with a slight fine yeast haze under a one finger fizzy and foamy white head that fell to a thin covering.  Aroma is the gold standard for an Abbey Triple I suppose.  Heavy thick pale malt with some yeast, alcohol, fruitiness, spices, and dough.  Flavor is floral and fruity with some hefty alcohol up front.  Finishes quite dry with lots of spiciness.  A little too much alcohol apparency for me, but I find that with alot of Tripels.  Mouthfeel is very spritzy despite the heavy thick maltiness, finishing quite a bit drier than many Tripels.  This may be the standard, but its the standard in a style that I think may be one of my least favorite.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Strong with lots of lighter fruit in the nose; lots of yeast and banana, some pear, light apricot, light honey and pepper, faint floral with whisps of alcohol.  Flavor is somewhat of a letdown from the nose, sweet with candi sugar and not as much fruit.  Starts sweet with a honey, banana, clove, and a light bread note; moves drier and more bitter with some notes of pepper and floral.  By the finish, the alcohol makes itself known and ending quickly with some notes of herbal, but still banana, honey, and pepper.  Palate is medium full, lively, and a rich, creamy mouthfeel.

There is also a background of musty green vegtables that builds a complex depth to the beer.  Flavor Is similar to the aroma though more intense.  The spice character really comes out.  There is an earthiness that reminds me of a saison.  Some banana and other fruit flavor come through into the flavor profile but in subdued amounts.

The flavor is again marked by the yeast, and a sweet though surprisingly malty taste with a good balance between sweetness and alcohol. The flowery hops are obvious as in a botanic garden, and the quite bitter finish subdues the alcohol; by that it gives no impression of a 9,5% ABV.

Smelled of mandarin oranges, coriander, fresh cut roses, spicy yeast and of sweet green grapes. 

The flavor contains a smooth, creamy and understated sweet wheat and peach sweetness accompanied by a floral and pungent grapefruit and citrus yeast. The way these two flavors blended effortlessly together to create one potent, yet smooth sensation is beyond my vocabulary. Finishes pleasantly dry and yeasty. When I exhaled after a sip, green grapes became very noticeable.

Did I just give this a 4.5? That puts it in my top 1%. I wasnt expecting that, but I sure dont see where Ive overinflating the scores. This is a stunningly good beer in every respect, and its the best tripel  (a personal favorite style) that Ive ever had. 

This beer pours a beautiful gold with a rich white head. The nose is a delight, strong spicy yeast aromas with honey and citrus, some passionfruit, and the faintest whisiper of alcohol.
This is the sort of aroma that makes it very hard to do anything other than dive right into a huge first sip. Much to my surprise and delight, that first sip was every bit as good as the aroma hinted it might be. A lively, spicy, and relatively dry tripel livened up with a light tropical fruitiness that makes the overall beer easy to drink, almost as if it were gently sweet but without the cloyingness that can come with a strong sweet Belgian beer. The hops kick in resolutely in the finish, leaing a lovely balanced bitterness on the long end of the flavor profile, accented by the lingering spiciness of the yeasts.

The mouthfeel is exceptional: impressively creamy, rich without being heavy in any way, a 9.5% that simply hnts at its presence, adding a fullness and graitas without any heat. 

Absolutely marvellous.

Peachy and opaque, with a fair amount of chunky deposit, not much of a surprise for a such an old bottle.  What was surprising was the lovely thick pearly white head, so far it seemed to have aged quite well.

Fusels seem to be a bit more tame than in a fresh sample, but were still fruity, if not a bit more vinous, but without being too maderized.

The age came through a bit more in the flavor, although carbonation was still in great shape.  It made me think of an old attic or dusty basement, but in a good, fond memory kind of way.  I was expecting the alcohol to be much more prevalent, but it wasnt playing the diva at all, even though it was bone dry in the finish.

3244,"2006-07-19",3.5,"Pioneers and trendsetters have through time, and in all domains, been the object of innumerable imitators. In the arts, followers built movements such as cubism or surrealism, but the instant an innovator arises there will always be those who take the concept to new levels. While we sometimes remember the creator, as Picasso has been remembered for cubism, other times history retains the epigone, such as the idiosyncratic Dalí. The same phenomenon emerges in the world of beer and after visiting the tripels of famous brewers throughout Belgium, it seemed that I would ineluctably encounter the original. Westmalle may have designed an idea long ago, but when compared to the eccentric creations of today, such as La Chouffes Houblon Dobbelen IPA Tripel, it is rather clear that evolution means to break stylistic barriers and merge seemingly opposite movements; for better or for worse. With all that in mind, I simply pour Westmalles uvre into the goblet it seeks. The clouded gold body quietly erects a spongy white foam that slowly expands before thickening to a cream. White chocolate and vanilla scents form the principal essence, supported by the salient ester aromas, banana and bubble gum, the sweet malts, toffee and cookie dough and the finely intertwined spices, pepper and clove. Redolent grains and white grapes make an appearance beside a sweet white honey fragrance. At that point, one might sigh and conclude that after all, everything in the world is right. As for myself, I simply sipped from the glass and decided, mid-swallow, that that time had not come. Cereal and biscuity flavors become more apparent in the flavor. Banana and apple share the stage with prompt spices: coriander, clove, pepper and vanilla proceed in file across the tongue. The untactful carbonation and dry palate seal the peppery aftertaste with a lingering thirst. The broken rhythm of this beer leaves me reminiscing of greater examples, and the recurrent pattern of a fading archetype.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3244,"2006-06-05",3.9,"Sampled in Ieper, Belgium. Poured a typical cloudy yellow color with a nice huge head that lasted quite well and laced quite well. The aroma was typical of a tripel, with sweet malts dominating. However, the flavor was a bit sweet, the mouthfeel thick, and the finishing flavors mostly sweet (lacking some hops). I think Victorys Golden Monkey is as good as this one, unfortunately. Second tasting, 4/8/06: Sticky sweetness was completely non-existent (relative to the style). The hoppy finish was definitely notable, quite nice, actually. Flavor profile was apples with some candi sugar, v. light bananas, and a tingly hop finish. Excellent lacing.

Clear other than some dregs floating.  Nice yellow with a hint of orange.  Big, thick, creamy 2"" chunky white head.  Falls to a big thick layer of foam.  Big lacing.  Big, huge banana aroma.  Little bit of yeast character.  Little bit of spice.  Little sweetness, little bit of hops.  Flavor is sharp and bitter as it hits your tongue.  Then smooth and balanced in the mouth.  Really crisp and really dry in the finish.  Then a  ton of banana and yeast flavor after the swallow.  Little spice.  Very tart after the swallow.  Flavor (mostly the tartness) mellows a little as it warms, but not much.  Palate is really light with lots of carbonation.  Really dry finish.  Overall it is good and plenty enjoyable.  Definitely an interesting belgian.  But it is definitely not the best tripel Ive had.  Little high on the bitterness and dryness - and that tartness.  Id like to see some more complex flavors.

White grapes/white wine, acidic in a nice way, some slight fruit (figs?) and a tiny hint of alcohol. Very interesting. Taste...hmm... it struck me as a totally atypical tripel, which is odd considering that its the original... Again, a white wine like taste, only more ""noble"" than any Ive ever tasted. Bloody great underlying fruity maltiness, that, unfortunately, doesnt show up much. Some alcohol (though I never thought it was really that evident). Some chewy hopiness in the late taste, which I didnt exactly love (it was ok), that goes into the aftertaste and sticks in going from a grape seeds taste to a herbal one clinging to the back of the mouth and mixing with the subdued lemon acidity that shows up around the same time.

3244,"2006-02-28",3.8,"750 ml bottle that says Westmalle trappist with ALE TRIPEL on the front.  On the back it says Authentic Trappist Product and says to serve at 45-50 degrees F.  This bottle came from my fridge which is kept at 44 degrees.  I let it sit out about 10-15 minutes before I opened it.  I left it sitting out while I drank it.

This poured up a cloudy orange with about a fingers worth of a beautiful white head.  The head was made up of very small bubbles with a few large ones here and there.  It lasted about a minute or two and then settled down into a ring around the inside of my snifter.  Small bubbles streamed up everywhere from the bottom of the glass.

It has a light fruity aroma with some notes of caramel underneath.  As the beer warmed up the fruity smell gave way to a pronounced alcohol aroma.

A surprising citrus almost bitter flavor hit me on the front end.  As it strolled around my mouth it got the fruity flavor I was expecting.  A very light caramel flavor as you swallow is then followed up by a sharp tang on the back of the tongue.

The carbonation keeps this one light on the mouth.  It is kind of ""spritzy.""

Citrus, banana and tropical juice in the aroma, along with a pleasant alcohol touch, a faint spice note and some pale malts. The hops also shines throug in a sort of peppery way. Its full-bodied and effervescent, slightly warming down the throat, and with a fine bitterness. Theres flavors of fresh fruits, lemon peel, pale malts and spices. Some cellar and yeast notes too. Very well balanced, even though the alcohol might be a bit more evident than I prefer. It kinda suits the beer though. Lasting warm finish with fruits, pale malts and bitterness.

3244,"2006-01-23",2.8,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2007 Westmalle has long been revered as one of the great six Trappist breweries dotted around Belgium.  It has also long been out of my reach.  Now Ive had my taste.  A bitter, dry, raspy taste like the withered hand of the elder tyrant, a foul and offensive flavor with consummate reviling details.  The Westmalle Tripel is the nadir of Tripels, a shamed nomad who wanders from palate to palate.  Each new tongue marks a new exodus, down the throat and, for me, almost back up.  The appearance is the standard straw colored Tripel shade, bubbling into a laconic but active head of white.  From that mattress of billowing foam emanates a fragrance of apples, pears, butter and bubble gum.  But the taste is horrible, excessively dry and burdened with more alcohol than it can carry.  The label tells another story, of a delicate beer meant for delicate consumers, those tried and true beer drinkers out there plodding around the world who have the genteel knack for tasting quality brews.  To these men and women, the Westmalle is a scoundrel.  It is dressed like a beer of luxury, and smells like a fruit garden, though it reeks of treachery.  The Westmalle Tripel is drier than the sun bleached bones of fallen Grecian warriors, more bitter than the spited prince who lost his kingdom, and burns more than the hell fires promised to lick the heels of heathens.  It is all the worse for its regal coating, but even without the apocryphal robes of the rich the Tripel is just a poor excuse for a Tripel.  Beware this alluring foe of friends, it is only a bottle filled with oft mentioned and fabled assassins dagger.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The head actually doesnt just ""last"", it grows just sitting there! Champagne-like steady visible carbonation. Visible yeast clumps float near the bottom of the glass upon settling. A burst of alcohol hits the palate immediately upon first sip as does the considerable, champagne-like mouthfeel. None of the 9.5% ABV is hidden in this one.

Not my cup of tea....not very drinkable and too sharp to be savored slowly. I echo Oakes sentiment: "" what the hell is so special about this?""","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

Aroma is of masses of bready yeast, followed by rich fruity/spicy sweet malt and mild citrus - this is incredibly appealing and balanced, Tripels are not my favorite belgian, but *this* one ...  Taste is still balanced, but the alcohol asserts itself and the malt moves into the background with the citrus zest coming closer to the forefront but this is mostly about the spicy, lively, fruity alcohol - decent body and surprisingly bitter on the finish.

Pale and staunch aroma of sourdough, corn meal, coriander, starch, pepper and lemon rind scrapings.  Paling, curt and distantly sweet flavor intersession is met with a lemon shortbread - crossed with cornbread profile.  Love this dirty little yeast strain.  Spicy hop accentuations and generous spice contributions (in the form of coriander and pepper) meld well with a sodden leaf complexity to impart an earthen edge.  Theres no shaking the starch and muskiness, and perhaps the fact that its 13 days away from its day of reckoning, we have aging to thank for mellowing the sugar and balancing the abbey ale, carbonation levels included.  Admirable mouth feel and restrained candi sugar and fruity esters.  Some dactylic alcohol, but its bygones, because what we have here is a lovely tripel all-around.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

3244,"2005-10-31",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2005 A 750ml bottle with a synthetic cork.  Pours a hazy gold color and is topped by a frothy two-finger thick pale tan colored head.  The aroma is quite yeasty, despite the beer resting unsettled for two weeks in my beer fridge.  There is also lots of spicy yeast driven notes with pepper, ginger and lemon being most notable.  As I get used to the aroma some fruit notes begin to pick up, with notes of green apple and tart pear being evident.  The green apple note really becomes quite apparent after a bit.

The beer is full and peppery after my first sip.  The beer almost has a creamy consistency and the spice notes give it a piquant sharpness that I like in a good Tripel.  The spiciness hold throughout the taste profile of this beer, finishing with a sharp ginger like note  at the end.  This has a fairly full body to it, yet still remains quite dry on the palate, mainly I think because of the yeasty spiciness.  As I mentioned this tastes quite yeasty as well, it gives it a sharp yeast bite to it.  The beer has a light tartness to it that plays up the fruity aspects of the beer; mostly I get notes of green apple but there are notes of pear and a bit of tart plum as well, it also plays up the ginger note that is found in this beer.

A dense creamy pad of white foam formed atop a hazy orange-gold body. Head remained for the length and left overlapping patterns of lace down the glass. Spicy, almost bitingly zesty, citric, pear, vanilla and yeast aroma with a hint of guava and mango. Remaining quite fruity, the aroma began to show some alcohol as it warmed a little. Lighter than expected body, zesty and similarly fruity in the mouth, it was very smooth in the back with a high amount of carbonation upfront that failed to make it past the halfway point before drying out and becoming lightly bitter. Subtle flavours of ripe and tangy soft fruits, yeast, peppery spices and a good whack of fresh herbs. Finish is long, dry, tangy and warming, with a mix of orange-peel, alcohol, grassy herbs, vanilla and spicy, yeast and alcohol phenols.

Aroma off honey and cow-shit seems most common to me. Alcohol way too prominent. Spicy and dry like Orval, but it seems to bite off more than it can chew.

Big flavors here of lemon, banana, floral citrus, funky yeast, dusty esters, candy sugar, slighly fussel in its delivery, but it works here.  the flavors showcase that funky yeast character more than i was expecting, showing that this beer may have some age on it.  I assume about 1 year.  This beer has a numbing affect on the toungue throught the drink.  This beer has awesome aging potential i think.

3244,"2005-07-04",5.0,"Absolutely, my most favorite beer; theres only one unfortunate drawback: It does contain a minimal amount of alcohol, youll notice after a couple of bottles (on your way to the toilet)..
It has a full body, thin feel, average carbonation and a long finish.. The beer has a golden colour and theres supposed to be a white head on it.
Most bars in Holland have special glasses for this beer (which look like rather big whine glasses with the Westmalle logo printed on the side). Also, on the bottom of the bottle, theres supposed to be some residu of the fermentation process (which should have taken place in the bottle after shipment). Thats the reason good quality bars fill the glass for you (so you dont have to worry about spilling some of that residu out of the bottle, into your glass; you dont want it, it tastes bitter and gives you a headache, the day after..). Theyll also take care the separation between the white head and the golden liquid is exactly matched with the middle of the logo printed on the special Westmalle glas. Some bars even have little pieces of round paper with a hole in it which have the logo on them and which are put at the bottom of the trunk of the glass, preventing any wet stuff reaching the table top ;-)
If youre preparing the drink yourself (you can buy the beer at supermarkets) and like rituals: Have fun! Its even better than rolling a joint..","NETHERLANDS","Alchemist"

Lacking in flavor, especially compared to Karmeliet.  This is like a plain Belgian ale; reminds me of the unimpressive Unibroue 04 with a simple malt and alcohol flavor combination.

Aroma is of sweet malt and bready yeast with a substantial ester profile.  Some irritating alcohol vapors hit the back of your throat if you inhale too deeply as well.  Flavor is very hot and alcoholic upfront with develops nicely into a floral ester profile (banana, citrus, spiciness) with adequate sweet malt (not cloyingly sweet though) and yeastiness for balance.  A slight sourness lends a refreshing character.  I found that taking  a faster and larger sip bypassed the alcohol edge in the begining and got right to the complex middle and finish.

3244,"2005-03-26",3.9,"Highly accessible tripel which definitely went against my expectations for a Trappist ale.  Pours a deep gold with a fizzy head.  The aroma is spicy and fruity, and the flavor is clean and dry, with a spice bite followed by a more mellow and fruity finish.  Tastes like a very good, clean, strong ale--youd have no idea the abv is so high.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","braudimusprime"
3244,"2005-03-24",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2007 A slow, steady pour generates a rich, golden-peach hued beer--hazy and obviously bottle conditioned--with a mountainous, milk froth white head.  Slow to recede, light lacing.  The aroma is big, even at cooler temperatures, full of grains and pepper.  Forceful undercurrents of mandarin oranges and lemon zest rush past.  White grapes, sourdough bread, peaches...all working in harmony.  Faint traces of caramel can be detected, and even some coarse wool as well.  The flavour begins bready sweet, with hints of caramel, along with a robust orange acidity.  Tart fruits--lemons, grapes--emerge midpalate.  The finish brings a peppery spiciness and alcohol dryness.  Long, warm, peppery, herbal aftertaste.  Enjoyable, soft mineral compliment throughout.  The body is just over average, the texture dry yet velvety, carbonation very aggressive.  Bizarrely intriguing, an eclectic mix of soft and spicy, dry and sweet.  All ingredients make themselves pleasantly known; minerality of water, pungency of hops, richness of malt, esters and doughiness of yeast.  Quite an experience, but it feels lost in itself from time to time, spread too thin over so many aspects that it seems more like an amalgam of quality Tripels rather than a Tripel of its own.  33cl bottle, Duvel tulip, bbe 13/09/09.

750 mL, Chimay chalice.  Tall, creamy, white head is well lasting and sits upon a thoroughly hazy peach hued beer.  Spicy hops, lemons and pepper come across first.  The doughy yeast blends well with breadish and, at times, candyish malt aroma.  White grapes, pears, yellow raisins, peaches and a touch of Braeburn apples seamlessly integrate.  Strong sweetness upfront is matched by tart acidity and light spicy hops.  The backend is shallow of sweetness and really brings the tart and spice on in full.  Very dry and almost leathery finish.  Alcohol is burried in the nether regions of I know not where.  Medium full bodied with a silky texture and perky carbonation.  Original rating: 8,4,8,4,16 = 4.0.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Hazy gold with pristine foamy head thats like a fog cover, the bubbles are so fine.  Sour citrus, vanilla, candy, coconut, and some perceptible hops are all detectable in the aroma.  The flavour is spicy and sweet with subtle banana and peach notes and bitterness that I dont think comes from hops.  Higher alcohol and ""buttery"" flavour that ends with a well-balanced hop bitterness.  Interestingly, this beer does not feel warm, despite the high alcohol flavour and the high alcohol percentage.

With aging this beer becomes very smooth, gentle, subtle, I taste coriander, yeast and alcohol, the flavors are less prominent than the flavors of a younger Westmalle tripel but what it lost on flavor it gained immensely in palate. Full body, very mellow, smooth, comfortable texture, its a soft bed for the tastebuds. This beer always amazes me as it ages incredibly well.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

The aroma is classic Belgian, with the farmhouse like smells of hay, horse blanket, and dust, along with pepper and mustard like spiciness. The taste is delicate, and a lot drier than others of the style. The alcohol is quite hot and spicy, and there is a fair level of hop bitterness as the beer laps the tongue. This Tripel does not try to hide the strength it possess, but instead tries to sweep you off your feet with it.

Aromas of pineapple, lovely Belgian yeasties, band-aid, canned fruit salad.  Thick, sticky brew.  Acidic dryness to finish after ample yummy, juicy-fruit sweetness coats the mouth.  Wonderful example of the style, the extra aging is evident. Maybe a bit on the syrupy side, and the alcohol could have a greater presence...perhaps thats a product of the trappist aging.   Im surprised that Ive not tried this one before.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

 Much thinner than led to believe, immediately zestier, acidity is more pronounced. Very grassy at first swallow, toasty dry and hay-like aftertaste. Saaz-like hops (whatever hops it is that they use) is quite strong and dominates this beer. Orange peel and faint clove (the hard type that you push into a turkey...I always chew on those) flavor as this really gets warm.

The nose is a bit restrained showing a little hop and yeast. However, the palate is exploding with complex flavors. I taste tropical fruit, both pineapple and banana sprinkled with coriander, ginger, and green cardamom. The finish is equally as exciting as the palate, it is full of rich candi sugar flavors that lasts for several minutes.

The lacing is light and slippery, and the head lowers to a fine film. The aroma is fruity, doughy, hops and yeasty, with some astringency -- very fresh. Flavor is very tart and peppery with a sweet middle and a bite at the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy with a lingering hop finish.

With it?s high ABV, it is important to let it warm a bit. I had a few of these in Amsterdam. The one I had at the Reichsmuseum was a mystical experience. The ones I have had in the states, however, have been a lot harsher and, by comparison, a disappointment.","New Mexico, USA","igel"

Color is a hazy orange, and the heads a full, towering stack of crackling, lacey, creamy foam. Aroma is led by sugar and spice, followed by everything nice. On my first sip: sublime! Utterly heavenly! Light, smooth, uplifting, dazzling in every way.
Some fruitiness comes through in the middle, peaches, orange, slight citrus. Hops are lively, malt is solid, and delivers more than sufficient sweetness.

Poured out a beautiful, hazy golden yellow color. It has a humongous white head that wont quit. Served in my Chimay chalice, excellent choice for this particular beer. Aromas are of fresh malts, sweet Timothy grass, Belgian funk, horse blanket, leather, tobacco, yeasty sourdough bread, and slight whiff of citrus, most likely lemon. Lychee fruit, and candi sugars round out the aromas. The tastes are exactly as the aromas are. Full of fruity esters, slight smoke, alcohols, and sugars. Man, the good Brothers at Westmalle sure did their homework on brewing this nectar. This beer is an experience, not just a regular old run of the mill brew. It sure gives Westvleteren a run for the money, that much is certain. At 1/2 the price of Westy, this could easily be my everyday beer. But, that would spoil the entire experience for me at least. Finishes sweet, dry, and fruity, all at the same time. A wonderful triple from Belgium. Seek it out at all costs, Grasshopper.","","Cobra"

Lacing all over the snifter in thick sheets and a very hefty skim (basically a small cap of smoothened white foam) remains present the entire glass. Impressive cap and beautiful thickset color. 

Aroma is simple yet delicate with a pleasingly dry yeasty edge darted with some lemon peels and sugary sweetness. 

Taste is well mannered with a soft fruity front, well rounded and pleasant to the buds. Drops of lemon, maybe some tidbits of white or green grapes skins in there add some interesting little drying additions to the finish where the yeasty dryness floats off any reminiscent fruityness left over. Nice fading dry finish thats a bit complex and softly yeilding.

Feel is nearly full with a soft well rounded fluffyness thats really nice. A bit of sparkle in the carbonation and yeastyness really keeps a great attraction to thee lips. And the drying finish is alluring with very late spices making an appearance across the far back of the palate.

Right out of the fridge and just poured the carbonation is distracting and the alcohol causes a distinct booziness. Allowed to warm and shed carbonation it turns into a sweet, spicy and complex tripel.  Wheat, banana and candied malt.

Niche white head. The first few zips were quite okay. Herbal, alcoholic flavor with hints of banana and weizen in general. But then the finish: It was so bitter, I couldn´t believe it.

The taste is dominated by alcohol up front, which gives way to a very strong clove flavor. Sweetness fills in behind the alcohol fumes, which has hints of carmelized sugar and banana.

Flavour is malty, peppery and alcoholic. Beautiful mix of hops and alcohol in the finish to give that typical Tripel dryness. Id still rather a Karmeliet though. Aged bottle - BB Nov 04, drank Jul 05: Interesting. This beer had changed quite a lot - I wouldnt say it was much better, but it had some very interesting elements and was definitely worth aging. Firstly there was a bunch of yeast all caked around the top of the bottle which was very weird - the bottle had been stored vertically. The aroma had developed a beautifully layered caramel aroma quite distinct from the typical crystal malt or caramelised flavours - really nice. The other thing of note is that the balance had skewed definitively towards bitterness - malt was there and quite nice but it was probably the most bitter Belgian Ive had (not that thats a particularly big claim - even XX Bitter isnt all that bitter really.) An interesting experiment - I wonder if the recipe has changed since this bottle was brewed.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

The flavor is definitely yeasty...with a souring tart finish...citrusy qualities with a nice peppery dry finish. It had an almost apple cider like quality to it as the carbonation literally took over this beer. A bit hard to really enjoy the flavors given the carbonation, but definitely a world class beer.

The 9% alchohol level is very apparent and I believe it's hiding some very interesting flavors. There's the typical belgian yeast esters and a tinge of sweetness in the malt complimenting this well, and there is a sort of ""dingy"" flavor in the yeast that adds some unique appeal - very yeasty. I really do wish the alchohol weren't so blatant here, other than that the beer is pretty tasty - although there is some citrusy bitterness annoyingly poking at my tongue.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

3244,"2003-02-01",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2003 I didn't fancy to be the 161th of rating this beer. So I collected a brand-new 33cl bottle from the shop (BBd:01/05), a 75cl bottle from '99 (bbd: 12/04), 1 1/2 yr. in my cellar, and the oldest bottle I could find there: a, yet unlabeled, 33cl, bought 8/87 for 30 BEF (1Eur=40.34 BEF). Unless otherwise indicated, the tabel-marks are from the youngest bottle.
Colour '02:golden with slight orangey shine. Thick, white-creamy head, lacy, collapsing. '99:much finer head, stable, colour ident. '87: (dark8)amber; fine, small head, larger bubbles.
Nose: '02: grain, chaff, chalk, malts - not only pale - candi (?) -by warming: more hops; '99: much more worts, typical brewery-smell- yeasty and grains by warmingup (8p) '87: some grains, but lots of port&madeira notes (9p).
taste: '02: first hops, but then unpleasant taste of scorched sugar, disappears to leave sweet taste and bitterness, more hoppy, at mouthsides. English hops? '99: sweeter. definitely some oxidation (biscuit-madeira) but retronasal quite hoppy and dry (8p) '87: very fine port&walnut aroma, more sweet than '02, but sweetness strengthened by portarom. Still a lot of bitterness (9p)
Mouthfeel '02: quite chewy, strong hint of alcohol. Aftertaste more bitterness. '99: more creamy, and fine CO2 gives champenoise - Alcohol more masked. Creaminess gives less sharp aftertaste (4p) '87 mouthfeel chewy, syrupy, oily, not cloying. Esters and even higher alcohols give much more balanced finish (5p)
Overall : '02 lacks finesse, compared to the other two, but certainly to the '87 ('99:17p '87:19p)","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Nov, 2007 Theres elements of a strong lager about this - pale, light and with a strong alcohol that shows its plastic, solvent face. Yet theres also a delicate freshness, and some yummy qualities of spice, vanilla and orange. The warm brewing method and the powerful, hungry yeast develop some great character out of the pale, pilsner malt and the lager hops. There is much to be enjoyed in this - a dry, light strong pale ale. [3.5]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
3244,"2002-09-17",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2010 Bottle... This beer rocks!... Very nice. The aroma shouts MALT, YEAST, MALT! The hops are an afterthought. Also detected a hint of black pepper in the nose. This sparkling beer has a nice, dark golden hue. The initial sip is moderately malty and lightly hopped. I detected a little apple and black pepper. Fizzy. The finish is just a touch sour, but mostly crisp, clean and dry. Very nice belgian beer. Im looking forward to trying the dubbel as well.

3244,"2002-09-11",4.0,"I had two bottles of it tonight.  One that was dated 24/04/04 and the other one that I had cellared was dated 05/09/02.  The younger one had a golden yellow colour with a smalle head while the other one was more amber-like with a creamier and longer lasting head.  I found the young version quite agressive.  Alcohol, yeast, candy and my wife says citrus aroma.  The alcohol mostly masks the flavors but gives it a spicy character.  The cellared one was more about caramel, grapes and honey.  The alcohol flavor and aroma became a lot smoother and the beer felt very round.  If I could rate them as separate beers, the young one would be a 3.5 and the old one a 4.5.  Ill probably hold on to the ones I got left for a couple of years.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"

Serious Triple aroma boasting lemon, Saaz, grass, Sauvignon Blanc  notes, fresh flowers, and bready pale malt.  Spritziness, fluffiness, transitions to creaminess; reminscent of Hapkin as having the best feel I can recently remember.  Predominant flavors of pepper, dough-like chewiness, grass, metallic tinge, and clove.  German hop and spice round out the balanced/dry finish.  I love sweet Triples; and this is a sugary delight.  Alcohol perfectly evident; provides a tremendous warmth to the gullet.   Whenever I see this beer in 750s I grab a handful.  Im glad I have five more in the cellar.

Aroma of cookie dough, yeast, tropical fruit, grapes and Styrian hops (most notable). Alcohol esters as you swirl. Quite...different. Winey and sweet and tropical and hoppy, and then the sweetness falls out leaving a dry fruity taste in your mouth. Medium body, quite thick for a Trippel. Alcohol is tasted at times, wine like, yet not intrusive. Thins a bit as it sits, where the alcohol becomes more apparent. Lots of spicy and floral hops in this, in the aroma and flavor and long aftertaste. FruitIer, more alcohol tasting and yeasty than I would prefer but very good overall.

3244,"2001-12-18",4.0,"Snow-white foam over a clear golden brew, but NO bubbles.
Very fine hoppy, fruity nose, but no ways as intense nor fresh as Orval!
Fine foamy mouthful with excellent hoppy bitters, quite aromatic, but not particularly full-bodied.
Long in length, clean, with a moderately bitter aftertaste.
Not unlike Orval, but less intense and fine, a bit in the style of Duvel (would that be unTrappist behavior?).  Whilst I usually prefer the Brown Trappist ales, this is yet more proof of Trappist rule!","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"

3244,"2001-11-18",4.4,"I like and agree with most of flemishchars statements, have little new to add.  A great tripel; I tasted brandied raisins and some subtle smokiness.

3244,"2001-11-11",4.6,"Had a two year old bottle. Tasted like port wine, intense and overpowering. All the fruitiness you expect of a tripel. Thick and syrupy, definitely not refreshing but intensly satisfying. Good to finish you off in the evening.","Virginia, USA","FlemishChar"

3244,"2001-09-25",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2006 i think the average above of 3.84 is about right for this one. a very good beer but without the mouthfeel or complexity to get it into the 4s. nice smell anyway, 60% alcohol, but once you get past that theres flowery saaz, orange zest, and perfumey duvel-like yeast. head has heaps of different size bubbles which is nice, always a good sign. tastewise this divides into two: first of all theres creamy malt sweetness, then tangy, peppery, medicinal hop and yeast flavours with bitterness and alcohol burn both competing for the aftertaste. lots of nice spicy hop flavour is a definite plus. but the alcohol dominates - maybe a black n tan with the dubbel would be nice. rer8: (bb08/06, drunk 04/06) a year in the cellar does nothing for this - it tastes exactly the bloody same. which is all right. i just thought it would lose some of its edginess but maybe it needs 3 years for that.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"

3244,"2001-07-25",2.6,"This is like the leftovers from the dubbel. Contains all the bad qualities that were missing from its sister brew. Orange-brown color, slightly cloudy, with a nice, white head.  Pervading alcohol aroma makes it difficult to detect anything else.  Unfortunately,  the flavors that I know are there just bursting to get out cant quite overcome the supressing alcohol taste. I detected some hops, but found it impossible to identify any specific flavors.  I swished this around my mouth once...not too pleasant.  Drinkable, but barely.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

3244,"2001-03-09",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2004 New rating: cloudy golden, large fizzy head that dissipated somewhat rapidly.  Very nice aroma, mildly yeasty and spicy with phenols - a tad of banana, some clove.  Light malts are clear in the nose.  Flavor is nicely sweet, with pepper and phenols, palate is wonderfully light.  This seemed a fresh sample, as I could definitely detect some grassy and herbal flavoring hops skirting the edges of this.  The complexity added by the hops was astounding.  The finish was semi-dry, with hops and only a kiss of alcohol, which was overall very well masked.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
