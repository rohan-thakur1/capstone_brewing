1856,"2017-01-20",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Fruity and mineral, this Bockbier shares apricot sweetness and earthy bitterness in a flavorful but perhaps clunky organization.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the hazy dark blond.
-Flavor rendering is not as smooth as it could be.
-The earthy hop bitterness could be bolder to balance out the residual sugars.
-This is not the same level of quality as their year-round Lagerbier.

On tap at the butcher shop.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

1856,"2016-12-27",3.8,"(tap at the brewery) Hazy, orange-amber colour with an off-white foamy layer. Slightly yeasty, juicy malty aroma with fruity accents of apricots, peaches and citrus, herbal hoppy background. Bitter-sweet flavour, medium bodied, calm on carbon, quasi ungespundet. Dry malt character with fruity and floral notes; drying hops towards the lasting herbal-spicy and fruity finish. Very good. 19.XI.16","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"

Great Bock, tasty and extremely well balanced, even suitable for vegetarians...","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
1856,"2016-11-26",3.8,"Hazy amber with a large white head. Aroma had floral hops and Munich malt. Flavor was quite full with malty and floral notes. Although sweet it still finished bitter from the fresh floral hops. Lovely interpretation of the style.","Frederiksberg C, DENMARK","KimJohansen"
1856,"2016-11-21",3.3,"Hazy golden with little white head. Aroma is fruits, orange, mandarin, yeasts, flour, bread. Taste is much fruity sourness with a dark spicy hinge, phenols, and a little alcohol. Not so smooth, a little cloggy. Ok.","GERMANY","Ritzn"

1856,"2015-06-08",3.5,"At the source in Uetzing in Franconia-Germany. Pours a bit lighter than the regular lager (?), properly orange skin color kind of semi-filtered appearance, very vivid. Frothy off-white foamy head. Nose: balanced woody notes with caramel and butter cookies dominating the scene. Some melon too. Mouth: frizzier than the lager sister, alcohol character, fat too sugary (for me), molasses. Meant to warm you up at winter time!","Rome, ITALY","ippopotamo36"

1856,"2014-08-22",3.8,"1L bottle purchased and consumed at the brewery in Nov. 2013: Lightly hazed golden orange. Marmalade, piecrust, flowers, hay dust, nectar, rustic yeast and minerals comprise the appealing aroma. Lush carbonation. Initially juicy with a blend of marmalade richness and flower nectar. Hops become increasingly firm, taking on a woody, fennel seed spiciness beneath the elegant floral softness. Delectable fluffy haylike starches and vanilla cake accents fill out the body, yet despite the malt girth, things remain quite clean and the sugars well managed. Melanoidins bounce along gracefully amid the cakey substantialness. Zero alcohol is noted. Fresh sliced peach, fuzz and all, nicely mirrors the gentle scratch of minerals as a profusion of lemon candy and saliva-inducing hop oils supplement the core with ideal brightness. Finishes well-textured with notes of hay dust embracing the luscious nectar flavors and edgeless hoppiness. I was surprised I wasnt picking up any of the plastic notes (the dirty kind) that Ernest was at the time, as he and I usually are hypersensitive to those characters. I found it to be a pretty clean and  assertively hoppy, yet well-balanced and luscious bockbier which I found difficult to stop drinking.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
