The taste is sweet, lots of toasty caramel maltiness. Light fruitiness from the roast. Light bitterness in the finish from the oak.

Full thick body with medium carbonation and very smooth creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is very complex, at the forefront there is bourbon, with chocolate and licorice, in the back it is spicy with vanilla and fruity with dark berries and a hint of plum.

There are equal parts chocolate, vanilla, bourbon barrel, and a hefty booze to it as well. This is pretty complex, yet the alcohol controls the back end. The flavor is really good. Vanilla, chocolate, barrel, molasses, and everything you want in a nice barreled stout. The barrel is a little heavy on the finish. The mouth feel is lighter, pretty thin actually, with a strange carbonation and a lingeringly sweet chocolate and bourbon on the back end.

The bourbon barrel notes are extremely balanced and add to the wonderful complexity that is stones RIS. Pours pitch black with a beige head that disipates quickly leaving a ring of small bubbles clinging to the edges of the snifter. The smell is filled with vanilla, coconut, sweet cherries, and an oak bourbon flavor. The flavor has some cocoa, vanilla, anise and bourbon. Theres a good balance of sweetness from the barrels and bitterness from the base beer. The beer is very thick with a slight boozy sting on the tongue. The only thing I could hope for is version with espresso or chocolate to pump up those flavors because they didnt seem very pronounced in the beer","","connor0415"

Dark fruits (especially cherry), caramel, bittersweet chocolate, and the sweeter aspects of bourbon. While this Stout wasnt particularly heady (a side effect of all the booze and the age), there was a lot of goodness packed into its darkness.

A: Pure black, thin ring of mocha head with swirls on top of the stout, and legs.

N: Huge black licorice. Dominating, really. Big coffee, raisin, currant, cocoa, and roast as the semi-majority shareholders. Bourbon is less pronounced, though it lends a touch of coconut, vanilla, and caramel. Oak is less noticeable, however. 

T: Very sweet, slightly bitter, not cloying.

M: Oily, heavy body. Foaming, tickling carbonation. Hidden alcohol.

O: An impressive dark fruit rendition of the IRS. 4 oz is a meal in and of itself, though I have to admit, this goes down fairly smoothly.

This is part of Stones ""Quingenti Millilitre 2014 Series"", and is named for Fyodor Dostoyevsky, ""one of the greatest, most influential novelists of Russias Golden Age.""

And on to the beer. Pours a nearly pitch black with a thick rocky chocolate brown head comprised of various sized bubbles. This diminished fairly quickly, leaving sparse lacing and a small-bubble trace of head. Light passes as deep crimson hues on the glass when backlit, but only at the rim of the glass. 

Aroma is big and somewhat boozy - Chocolate, bourbon, oak, roasted malt and char. I am reminded of the complex roasty sweet aromas of a campfire. 

Flavor is gigantic and warming: Giant bourbon upfront, bittersweet chocolate, oak and vanilla sweetness. Alcohol is present, but isnt bothersome. The flavors are intensified by the warming alcohol. Thin to medium bodied, roasty, bitter finish. Outstanding and world class.","","RussianDragon"

AROMA: Tons of chocolate, booze, bourbon, some anise, tobacco, caramel, and vanilla. This beer makes its presence known once you pop the cork! The best part about the aroma to this beer is that it is strong and does not fade, most other stouts have a smell that becomes faint after a minute or two of pouring, but this one is brash and in your face the whole time! Its superb!

TASTE: Woah... Upfront there is loads of bourbon mixed with a perfect amount of booze, in the middle you get an awesome amount of chocolate, vanilla, a little anise, and caramel, then on the finish you get everything from the beginning and middle all perfectly mixed together with an addition of a hint of tobacco and hop bitterness, as it goes down you get a nice warmth from the booze. This beer is pretty well balanced with the characteristics that can make it unenjoyable, but for things that it needs plenty of to make it outstanding, and it has plenty of those ingredients! Superb transitions of flavors, and it gets even smoother as it warms as well! Definitely one of the best barrel aged stouts I have had!

3465,"2013-11-25",4.1,"Dark brown in a small glass, this beer has a medium-brown head and a very soft aroma, as it should. Light and smooth with a touch of chocolate, its classy with hints of anise and/or other spices present in the nose. Its light in the mouth and still retains quite a great amount of flavor over all these years. If this ages any longer Im thinking its going to start losing some of its great flavor profile. Otherwise, it almost, simply, tastes like a Russian Imperial Stout cut down to two-thirds of its original potency. So this is what happens to IRS when it ages! Definite barrel characteristics are present, but theyre not too woody the beer was carefully aged in that barrel. Theres nothing like a bourbon barrel aged beer, and this is very much a well-done one. The finish is very clean and smooth, almost a little empty. But the residual flavor is almost ghostly in character, with cocoa and some faint hints of liquor. Alcohol itself, though, is not present at all, allowing for a truly beautiful experience.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

3465,"2012-03-07",3.6,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/22/2011.  Served on tap in a snifter at Acre.

As expected, this is pitch black with just a hint of mahogany and ruby in the edges.

The aroma is full of bourbon; it is in the forefront to the point where it kind of drowns out the other wonderful smells. Molasses, dark fruits, and a bit of anise and chocolate are pushed to the periphery. 

The flavor is again a bit strong on the bourbon for me, considering that the base beer is so good. It starts strong and stays on the palate through each sip. Behind that, some molasses and vague dark fruit sweetness start out, with vanilla, oak, and roasted malt rounding out the front. The roasted malt has a tinge of burnt character and flows into a coffee bitterness nicely as the sip progresses. The finish is lightly bitter with more bourbon.

This has a dry, woody, oaky feel, which makes it feel less full bodied than the original. Medium carbonation is on the creamy side. 

If I had this on its own, it would be a fine beer. The only issue is that Stone had the audacity to make IRS so good that drowning the flavor out with bourbon is a downgrade. Some people might like the bourbon treatment to be over the top, but I prefer it to be more nuanced.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

The highlight of Cleveland Beer Week for me was the chance to try this elusive beer. Right up there with barrel aged versions of Dark Lord and Bourbon County Stout it ranks as a beer that everyone should try at least once. I think I might like regular RIS slightly better but it is a close call.

Aroma / Appearance - The heavy black body sits wearily at the bottom of the glass. A lively brown head imbues a good contrast as I wait for the pour to warm from 40 degrees to room temperature. Vanilla, chocolate, oak, malt, and cocoa nibs waft effortlessly towards the senses. Time has mellowed the base beer somewhat though the aging process has not produced a bourbon bomb. Anise adds some additional sweetness around the edges.

Flavor / Palate - Fresh coffee, malt, dark chocolate drizzled over a handful of licorice hard candy, and vanilla alternate the spotlight. The oak aging is soft around the edges and plays nicely with the other flavors. While it is impossible to mask an 11% ABV completely this is so smooth that it sneaks up on you only at the last minute. A world class release, I would expect no less from Stone given their track record.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

No head.  Dark black opaque.  Lots of bourbon and oak vanilla notes, a bit of roasted dark malt.  Very well balanced.

3.5 A: Black. Pour yielded no head.

4.5 S: The barrel aging is done extremely well. The bourbon portion is perfect. Incredibly smooth with leather, melon, prune, and plum. However, the underlying stout cant stand tall alongside. Some chocolate and roast, but does not seem to have the subtleties that the regular has at this age. Still, bourbon forward or not, smells delicious.

3.5 T: I have no idea where the Stone IRS went. This tastes a bit like watered down bourbon rather than a bourbon enhanced stout. Theres just a little chocolate and a little roast. However, the bourbon itself makes this still taste great. Leather, melon, prune, and plum. Alcohol is very well hidden.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could be creamier though.

3.5 D: Decent, but stout that cant stand tall above barrel treatments should not be put into barrels. Im completely shocked that Stone IRS is one of these.

3465,"2010-11-22",4.0,"Sampled at FoBAB 2010.  Honestly, I was pretty excited when I saw this in the pamphlet.  I thought, ""Finally, I get to try it.""  Pours black with tan head.  Lots of bourbon, vanilla, oak in the aroma.  Flavor is good but not quite as great as I hoped.  Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, kind of sticky mouthfeel with a bit of roast and tar.  It is good, just not one of the best bourbon barrel Imperial Stouts.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
3465,"2010-11-19",4.2,"Draft  Maxs. Black, tan creamy head.  Deep bourbon and old oak aromas warm to layers of vanilla and dark roasty malt.   Bourbon booze and oak flavors round out with touches of vanilla cocoa and burnt caramel-coffee throughout.  Medium bodied and smooth with soft carbonation.  Its not GI BCS, but its in the same realm.  Very well done","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
3465,"2010-11-19",4.4,"Growler sampled at BPS tasting. 
A perfectly balanced BA stout that retains tons of stout flavors while adding strong bourbon notes in the background.  Semi dry roasted with a smooth bourbon finish. It does have a strong alcohol burn that dissipates quickly.  Carbonation is mostly flat, but is full bodied with a silky and thick texture. Awesome stuff.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"
3465,"2010-11-18",4.4,"12 oz. @ Brouwers. I like my bourbon barrels boozy and this one doesnt disappoint. If anything, it tastes too much like bourbon. But its not a dealbreaker. Everything I could want from an imperial stout and only better with age (2008 vintage).","Washington, USA","killjoy966"
3465,"2010-11-16",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2011 Draft sample at FOBAB 2010.  I was excited to see this one show up.  The regular IRS from Stone isnt my favorite imperial stout, but I was really curious to try this version.  Turns out the regular one is seriously improved with the barrel treatment, as big vanilla, oak, and bourbon notes pop in the aroma and flavor, and the nice chocolate and coffee roasted malts, molasses, earth, brown sugar, and dark fruit notes all come through in harmony.  Full-bodied, with a sweet, smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation.  Dont listen to lushawn- he sucks- because this is awesome. RE-RATE, 4/21/11: What do you know? I was right, Shawn was wrong. No rating change for me. Sampled again at the Stone Total Tap Takeover at iTap-Soulard for the MO release of Stone. Bourbon-barrel imperial stouts dont get much better than this in flavor and on the palate. Truly an amazing example of the style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3465,"2010-10-20",4.7,"Appearance: Black, viscous-looking, leg-producing body with a quietly receding, dark brown head.

Smell: Big, beautiful bourbon presence on the nose marrying well with the robust dark roasted malts notes. Its altogether inviting.

Taste: From start to finish, its a sweet, earthy roastiness stirred up with slowly melted barkers chocolate chunks, vanilla beans, burnt caramel sauce, dark brown sugar, oak wood (with some tannins breaking through), dark fruits, chilled coffee, shaved coconut and a fair share of burgeoning alcohol warmth. Its all quite bold, but it still maintains a quiet, easy-going mellowness.

Mouthfeel: Near-full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Very nice. Look, I love Stone Russian Imperial Stone, but the deliciousness of the bourbon barrel version has been the highpoint of my beer drinking in the last several months. Oh, if only all the barrel-aged stouts could turn out this well.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

3465,"2010-10-04",4.1,"Tap at Alewife Baltimore for Stone Total Tap Takeover. Poured near ink black with ruby highlights. Tan bubbles cling onto the sides of the glass but no head forms. Aroma is beautiful buttery bourbon, coconut, vanilla, oak, rich smokiness. Taste is a giant smack in the face of unsweetened, bitter chocolate, smoked malt, hot bourbon moving very quickly to silky chocolate, coconut, vanilla ice cream. Palate goes from soft to chalky and bitter cacao powder. About six seconds after tasting this I knew exactly why it is in the ratebeer Top 20. Everything is there: the aroma, the body, the palate. It is like Bourbon Country Stout with a little less richness and less of a superlative palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

3465,"2010-09-30",3.6,"Draft at Twisted Spoke during Stone Week.  Pours a darker milk chocolate color/consistency seemingly with a dense mocha head made of larger bubbles.  Aroma is quite nice, lovely bourbon and dark chocolate, vanilla, creamy.  Flavor follows but a bit too one-noteish for me, sweet vanilla and chocolate syrup with ample bourbon, marshmallowy, reminds me of the Big Sky Ivan the Terrible.  A bit too milky creamy for me, larger soft carbonation, sticky.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Overall amazing!","Lake Arrowhead, California, USA","JoeTheYounger"
3465,"2010-08-22",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2011 Served on tap at the Stone 14th Anniversary Celebration. The whole reason I purchased then Rare Beer Section ticket was for my speculation that this personal whale would be served so I was stoked to see it on the list. The first sample of the day for me. The appearance is a  full rich black with a huge creamy tan head. The nose is full of delicious bourbon, chocolate, oak. The flavors are also full of that rich bourbon, prunes, chocolate, oats. This is still a touch hot but fabulous and really smooth.


Resampled at Downtown Johnny Browns. It was the 2008 version and it was lacking a lot of what the first experience had. The bourbon was not really there and it tasted more like a couple year old regular version. Wonder if it was mislabeled. My score reflects the original tasting. 


Resampled again at Winter Storm 2011 and this beer was every bit as good or better then the first time. Such a great full bodied malt profile that hits all the delicious heavy roasted flavors, mostly the dark chocolates. The bourbon  is so smooth and rich with vanilla and a nice wood note as well. I could drink this everyday and want for not. Please have this more more appearances!!","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"

3465,"2010-08-21",3.7,"08 Vintage. Black with a golden rim and a very thin, fine, dark tan head. Powerful, sweet boozey aroma with abundant caramel and toffee.

Aroma:  Smokey malts,huge bourbon vanilla caramel notes.

Taste: Sweet bourbon, toast, caramel and roast.

Mouthfeel: Low carbonation and quite syrupy.

Overall:  Very decadent, very sweet, and seemed much thicker than traditional IRS.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
3465,"2010-05-25",4.2,"A: A jet black pour out of the growler with a sturdy tan head on top.

S: The amount of vanilla in the nose is absolutely astounding. The stout notes are still there--chocolate and roast, but the bourbon itself was somewhat muted.

T: Even more vanilla as the beer hits the tongue. Quite sweet, especially when compared to the base beer. A mild bourbon presence and some nice tannins from the barrel.

M: Quite medium to full bodied with a low, rolling carbonation. Not quite as thick and chewy as the IRS tends to be, but quite nice.

D: This one can catch up with you rather quickly. A pleasure to have been able to drink and I wish that there werent so many beers to try so I could have enjoyed this one a bit more.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3465,"2010-05-21",4.0,"2008 version at the Stone Domination by Aces and Ales. Pours a deep, dark brown with a thick brown head and some lacing. Aroma is mostly bourbon with a little oak and coffee.

3465,"2010-04-23",4.9,"Sampled the 2008 vintage at the ""Stoned for Six Days"" event in Houston, TX. Smells of sticky sweet raisin and coffee, leaving the suggestion of oils in the nostril. Tastes dark, thick and oily, though much softer and rounded in flavor than the non-bourbon aged 08 IRS vintage. Hints of hops on the finish and a long lingering aftertaste of malt and bourbon make this a delight. Awesome.","Alabama, USA","JohnCoyne"
3465,"2010-04-21",4.7,"Sampler during Stone Week (April 3) at Finnegans, Plainfield. 2008 vintage. Cant you tell this was what I was drinking at closing time? Black body with a thick ring of foam. Smell of strawberries soaked in bourbon. Dare i say, more heady, impressive and intoxicating than my beloved Bourbon County Stout? Maybe. Alcoholic but not ""hot,"" and with no ""burnt"" pieces like many stouts. Just some nutty roast malts paired with a fruit and bourbon smell.

Aromas are warming vanilla tannins and roasted malts, a touch of sweeter cocoa, coffee, caramel malts. A bit sweeter than your average BA stout. Initial is smooth and silky, fairly sweet with cocoa, vanilla, and caramel. Fairly full bodied on the palate. Moving into wet wood and tannins, warming bourbon, a truly easy going barrel aged imperial stout, warm roasty and a bit sweet.

The colours are extremely good looking and Im sure the appearance wouldve gotten a perfect score from me, if the beer had been served directly from the tap. The aroma bursts with sweet french roast coffee and heavy bourbon notes. On the palate the beer is extremely creamy and soft with sweetness both from the residual sugars and the alcohol. Again the bourbon is very present - it seems that the bourbon cask hasnt been emptied completely before the beer was put in. So this is a beer that is sure to divide people.

3465,"2008-07-05",4.6,"Growler from Stone. 2006 BBA version, filled May 2008. Wasn’t sure of what to expect with this brew. The age was very prominent; had a sort of musty flavor. But the bourbon was very strong and prominent. Taste had lots of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, hops with a creamy smooth texture that smacks the lucky taster in all areas of the mouth and tongue. Taste lingers and develops with time. This beer will make you think long and hard and ponder exactly just what you’re drinking. Alcohol is still prominent but not as much as when freshly brewed. 

Make sure to consume this at a warmer temperature than other beers. Also, the beer seemed to mellow out the day after the growler was first opened. And even moreso the third day. Different flavors came out during those second and third tastings.

3465,"2008-06-13",4.5,"May 2008 Release; Sampled June 2008
A careful pour produces a half-finger thick, brown tinged, darker tan colored head.  The beer is pitch black and color and quite opaque.  Ample, spicy Bourbon aromas are noticeable without completely drowning out the Stout aromatics.  Roast espresso aromas, charred prune notes, bit roast grain and a finish dominated by deeply toasted grain notes that lean towards toasted, not quite burnt whole grain bread.  The aroma has some sweetness to it, that is accentuated just a bit by the Bourbon-alcohol aromas.  When intensely scrutinizing the aroma the Bourbon notes are big up front, but then disappear and allow that pure stout notes to come through, but then things start to meld together as toasted barrel notes of coconut , vanillin mix with dark, rich, sweet malty chocolate aromas.  This has a very nice aroma to it, much better than I was expecting as the Bourbon barrel notes are quite well integrated; the Imperial stout aromatics are still allowed to shine here & really show quite well as they mix with the barrel notes.

Fairly thick and viscous up front, the beer gets a bit thinner towards the finish as some boozy, Bourbon notes kick in.  Creamy feeling with a huge, richly, dark malt sweetened, chocolate flavors are accentuated by the barrel with flavors of vanillin, a light coconut note and a rich, burnt fruit character.  This last reminds me of a mix of deeply roasted, burnt, succulent figs, moist prunes and raisins.  While not overly thick or viscous this really has an unctuous, creamy fullness that just engulfs the palate; when warmed up a bit it even manages to over-power the thinning effect of the Bourbon booze in the finish.  When cooler the hop and roast grain notes combine to give this beer a substantial, but sometimes overlooked, bitterness.

The bitter, burnt roast notes are what really define this beer; not necessarily in the way you might think though as these notes are very well integrated and never allowed to become harsh, sharp nor astringent.  Instead the roast character plays an almost supporting role (if you can imagine such a thing in an Imperial Stout), creating a rich, roast malt depth & balancing act that provides touches of bitterness, a light roast acidity and a deep black coffee note that serves as a light foil to the sweet, concentrated, chocolate like, thick malt character that is so nice in this beer.  The texture, especially, really starts to come in to its own as the beer warms up; the boozy Bourbon notes that thinned out the finish are tamed and this beer remains a creamy, viscous, palate enveloping experience from the start to long, lingering finish of each sip.  Even the aroma gets increasingly better as it warms up; accentuating more of the chocolate, toasted coconut and vanillin notes.

This is far better than I was expecting; I had thought I was burnt out on Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stouts, but this shows I just need a nice, well balanced example to keep me interested in the style.  Perhaps just a touch too boozy in the finish, this beer otherwise is a classic example of the marriage of Bourbon and Imperial Stout.  I really did not expect to love this; I assumed that at most I might find it interesting and slightly enjoyable, instead this is just down right tasty & easily the best use of a Bourbon barrel in a beer that I have had.  Stones Imperial stout requires some age on it to be at its best, this beer manages to display those characteristics as well as an added boost of complexity from the Bourbon barrel that was not overdone.  I almost feel guilty for liking this beer as much as I do, especially since I was expecting to be able to easily tear it down.  This really needs to be served on the warm side of cool; it started out at 50°F / 10°C, but still really becomes phenomenal the longer I wait.  I have about a half ounce left and it seems to be at its best after sitting in my glass for the last hour and a half; damn there it goes, unexpectedly I am left wanting more.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Lots of bourbon and vanilla for the flavor.  Oak fades away a bit.  Plenty of roasted malt.  Some coconut.  Thin bodied, but I will attribute that to the hand bottling.  Its been a long time since Ive had the regular RIS, but it definitely doesnt seem like the same beer just with bourbon aging.  It seems to have completely mutated the underlying beer into something not even recognizeable as the same stout.

Taste is thick and oily, no carbonation, with flavors of hard coconut, bourbon, chocolate and some tasted dark malt, Finish continues the coconut/bourbon aftertaste that really coats the tongue and lingers after the finish.

Aroma is very limited with a lot of bourbon, coconut, and vanilla.  Theres also a little bit of chocolate and roasted malt, but none of the smells are really that strong.  The taste really falls flat, with a hint of bourbon, light roasted malt, and really not much else.  The flavors are there for a split second, and then they just vanish.  As OSLO said, the regular RIS is far superior to this creation.  I know its the in thing to barrel age beers, but this particular beer was not enhanced in any way by the barrel aging.

Dense black pour with a thin dark tan chocolate milk like head.  Smell is roasted malt and bourbon and vanilla and oak.  Flavor is a hint ""hot"" bourbon up front but it has a nice roasted character to it.  Finish is oily and slick - it actually leaves an oily coat on the tongue. Little to no carbonation.  Flavor is smooth and balanced and has a nice body and character.  Really becomes so much better as it warms. Yummy, super slick and creamy.  I almost want a hint more body and boost to it - just perhaps a touch creamier.  However, the flavor more than makes up for any weakness here.  Aftertaste is nice and balanced.  Very enjoyable, drinkable and I highly recommend this.","Austin, Texas, USA","pintsize"

3465,"2008-06-04",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2009 In short: A brutal sipper.  Rudimentary but effective extra-strong bourbon intensive Imperial Stout.  A good but very much overrated sipper.
How: From a fresh 1L growler brought back from the brewery by Francois Mtl.  Drank only a few days after the growler was filled.  Shared on the Stone-Bourbon-Barrel-RIS-Hype-And-Disappointment tasting session with the Montreal crew.
The look: Black body with a tan ring of foam 
In long: Lots and lots of of barrels on the nose and taste.  Attack of alcohol, bourbon, very roasted malts (slight burnt sensation) and thick molasses ending abruptly with sharp bite of bitterness and alcohol.  Alcohol feels like 15%.  This is a brutal sipper with very little complexity.  Initial impression was 3.9 but after drinking more strong beers at the tasting session it kept going down.  The absurdly high ratings has more to do with rarity than quality.  This beer has a lot of alcohol, its Bourbon Barrel Aged and more importantly its rare.  When a beer has those three qualities ratebeer turns into the music Billboard and the top-50 has nothing to do with quality.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3465,"2008-05-26",3.5,"Objectively speaking:
From a 1L growler brought back by François. Thanks! Another bourbon barrel aged imperial stout who uses the powerful weapon that rarity is against Ratebeers Bayesian scale!


I like:
No annoying vegetal (spent grain, corn syrup) character from the barrel, more like pure wood and vanilla components. Rather rich body for a beer that went through a barrel, no apparent thinning. Roastiness manages to pass through the bourbon. No cloying factor.


I dislike:
Its hard to figure out what sets it apart from its concurrents enough to justify a current 4.4 average. No bottles available to age up the edges (Some flavours head in totally opposite directions, namely the bitterness). Not very balanced as this stage (still intensely bourbony) and to me, not superior to their regular impy.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
3465,"2008-05-26",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
A plethora of intense flavors and aromas runs across the senses: bourbon, molasses, chocolate, roastiness, alcohol, dry wood, etc. This plump and bold Imperial Stout might stilll be a tad before its prime, but it has a lot going for it now for those who love the style.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam surfaces atop the pitch darkness.
-The vanilla character of the bourbon barrel fits with the grain bill.
-The alcohol hit in the finish is not really fun, to my tastes. It takes quite a bit of getting used to.
-The body is seductively rotund.
-There is as much barrel contribution as there is an imperial stout apport here, so this is for bourbon barrel fans, no doubt.
-All the flavors will probably meld with a few more months (or years).

3465,"2008-05-25",3.3,"Poured from a 1 liter swingtop bottle. Inky black pour glowing mahogany around the rim, settling beneath a thin tan film.  Hot tangy bourbon aroma;  butter, shaved coconut and toasted marshmallow.  Malts seem a little hollow; chocolate syrup, cheesecake, graham crackers.  Heat of a perfume stripe.  Dirty, earthy malt and nutty sweetness in the flavor.  Coconut milk.  Cocoa nibs.  Dry and powdery in general with a wisp of cinnamon; lots of gritty residual sugars.  Some minerals, basic alcohol and metallic bitterness; mid palate is weak and lightly astringent.  Mouthfeel is medium to full; while seeming made slightly more oily through barrel aging, it lacks severely in malt thickness considering the level of impact the bourbon seems to have had on the flavor.  Generally, everything seems pressed by this tangy, hot, acrid quality that cuts through those rich imperial stout nuances and strips them down.  Peppery alcohol, chewy roasts and perfume in warm, visceral finish that smacks with some kind of metallic, gritty coffee twang; harsh and simplistic.  Theres a fine line to be balanced when bourbon is in play, and this one just isnt careful enough.  Ultimately, its tiresomely ordinary.  Thanks for the opportunity Ty.

The roasted nutty chocolate aftertaset calls you back sip after sip.  There is a real ""cool vibe"" to this one.   This one rivals Full Sail Black Gold BB Aged!","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"
3465,"2007-11-17",4.8,"Tasted on tap at the 2007 Bistro West Coast Barrel Aged Beer Festival. This Imperial Stout pours a eclipse black color. Small sized tan head with great retention and amazing long lasting lacing. Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, brown sugar and oak. WOW. Full bodied Russian Imperial Stout. The malts are chocolate and coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak and dark fruit blend well in this beer. The hops are earthy. The bourbon flavor is pronounced but not overbearing. Extremely well balanced. Very smooth tasting. The 10% alcohol is not that noticeable. Complex yet very drinkable. As good as Stones regular Russian Imperial Stout is this one is way better. Incredible beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

3465,"2007-05-22",4.9,"Thanks to all my friends at Stone!  2007 IRS aged three months in Heaven Hill Bourbon Barrel.  Black with quickly dissipating tan head.  Aroma: chocolate, coffee, alcohol, bourbon.  Thick, syrupy full body palate with a silky smoothness as swallowed.  Initial taste of sweet caramel, chocolate, and vanilla transitioning to a remarkable bourbon taste with very subtle oak notes and finishing with an enjoyable bitterness and a lingering alcoholic warmth.  An extraordianry beer!","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
3465,"2007-02-18",4.3,"EBF 07.  Had multiple samples since it lasted longer than some other kegs.  Pours the same as thier regular RIS, although the head faded a bit and didnt leave much lacing.  Aroma is nice and rich with chocolates, nuts, light coffee hint, bourbon and oak were only there in moderate amounts- hints of vanilla as it warmed up.  Flavor has tons of the usual chocolate malts, caramel swetnes, roasty dryness, some fruity esters, hops are diminished in this version, vanilla, tannins, woody, vanilla, lighlty buttery oak, bourbon and a touch of alcohol.  I think the bourbon and wood thinned out the body a bit which hurt it a bit, but otherwise this was pretty damn good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3465,"2007-02-17",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2007 Draught at EBF 2/9/07Somebody get on the horn to Stone immediately.  I think hell just froze over because this is a subtley done, bourbon-aged beer.  Isnt that going against their policy?  I was expecting to get knocked down by bourbon.Great-looking beer.  Well-conditioned/settled beer shows medium to medium-high clarity, light carbonation and a dark, black cola appearance with a tan head that is moderately-well retained and laces somewhat.Soft smokiness and light saltiness in the nose fade in to an anise-laced chocolate-caramel maltiness with a moderate backing of sweet pale malt sugars.  Where is the bourbon?  Havent found it yet, Im impressed!  Light raisins and bits of prunes and boysenberries show up escorting vanilla and more chocolate-cola notes (chocolate/caramel-cola seems to be at the heart of this beer).  Not much ashiness or char in this one, which is fine with me, but a solid, balanced level of roastiness that balances the sweeter malt tones and helps dry things out in general.  Low hop levels, only some light wintergreen-like hop oils.  Bourbon is just phenomenally integrated.  The vanilla and bourbon flavors are only minor aspects of the nose.  Medium-high to high strength, surprisingly well-concealed alcohol.And the bourbon adds only minor aspects to the flavor, thankfully.  The bourbon only comes out right before the finish, just a slight oily/oaky dryness with pinches of wood tannin sharpness and light cocoa/vanilla.  It lingers on the finish, but is joined by chocolate and roasted malts, both dry and slightly salty.  It starts out a bit subdued, but all the better for it, as the flavor crescendo is immensely enjoyable.  Lots of chocolate, some raisins and prunes from the base beer and a bit of a brusque, crystal-malt-like dryness (could just be the filtration).  Lots to describe.  I dont even remember what my favorite vintage was any more, but its like the best vintage of their RIS aged subtley in bourbon barrels.  No extreme sweetness, roast, hop, char, bourbon, tannin, chocolate.  Clean, no yeastiness and a very elegant mouthfeel for an imperial stout with moderate carbonation and a minimally chewy texture.  Damn, the more I write about it, the more I realize how awesome it was.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3465,"2006-04-07",4.3,"Draft at Firkin Fest in Beserkeley.
One of the best beers I have evr tasted. Strong aroma of toffe and asmoked whiskey as well as cocoa. Super smooth, flavors again of bourbon, matlts, a bit of coffee and cocoa. Sweet and tart at the same time, very complex, a rare treat. As I understand it this was a very rare event that one of these got tapped.","Bay Area, California, USA","HopheadHans"
3465,"2006-04-07",4.4,"(Draft from firkin by gravity.  04/2006).  A tasty, deep, dark brew with a huge body and big aromas of coffee and bourbon.  Delicate?  I think not, aspidites!  Delicate like a freight train (albeit one just around the hill).  Huge aromas of espresso, oak, bourbon and chocolate.  ""Delicate"" on the tougne -- but more because it was served from the cellar temperature firkin than because this beer dances like a ballerina.  Very well-balanced and a definite hit.  Bottling it would be a shame ... it is SO good from the cask!","USA","smcd"
3465,"2006-04-02",4.7,"This is what a Bourbon Barrel Stout should be. Balanced, big, Rich , Delicate, Complex and down right amazing. Nose of Mocha, vanilla, caramel, whisky, toffee and bakers cocoa. Huge yet delicate mouthfeel and wonderful balance.  This should be bottled, but I am ok if no one gets to try it because ,I did.","manteca, California, USA","aspidites"
