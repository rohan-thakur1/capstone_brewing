2957,"2017-01-07",3.7,"So nice tasting! But can this really be classified as malt liquor? The few of the style I have tasted had next to no hop aroma or flavor and this one is bursting with hoppy awesomeness. I really like it but I think it would be more fair to call it an India Pale Lager or something similar. I will rate is as style fitting though since I thinks its pretty good tasting.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Brewhemia"
