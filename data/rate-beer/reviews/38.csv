38,"2016-01-03",3.8,"750 ml bottle acquired from the brewery taproom (Tillamook, OR). Pours a deep reddish cranberry hue with firm hazinessn murky rich berry, red wine purple color. Firmer berry pulp, frothy pinkish head dies to a mellow layer, loose film and mellow ringer laces minimally after a potent firm slow gusher off the bat. Aromas show pulpy raspberry, tart cherries and a firmer lactic appeal. Earth, yogurt, firm potent acidity and rich red berry appeal meets a growing firm mineral seat salt appeal. Earthy, dry, salty element isnt rich off the bat but comes on well as we settle in. Initial is sour and deep, a firmer berry presence is spritzy, berry tinged and a touch tannic. A firmer lactic appeal is potent and sour, some firmer salty appeal grows with subtle straw, firmer pulpy seedy raspberry elements are fruity, deep and offer some tannic appeal. The cherryskin comes in, a touch tart and bitter with residual salty appeal. A firmer lactic presence actually gets a bit lost behind that richer berry fruit presence overall, adding some complexity and spin in its own right. That salty appeal covers up a more potent acidity into the back as well, again softening the acidity from that base lactic appeal. A firmer deep fruit addition and salty gose liveliness makes this much easier on the palate. Rich, fruity, tart with some salty appeal, earth and straw. Pleasant stuff. A fun flow and balance from all trhe elements.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
