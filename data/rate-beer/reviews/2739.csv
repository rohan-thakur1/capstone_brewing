2739,"2017-04-18",3.3,"(can) Almost clear, pale golden colour with a blond mid-sized frothy head. Mildly grainy malty aroma with citric and slightly grassy hops. Slightly bitter and delicately sweet flavour, light bodied with a crisp carbonation. Slim pale malt-character with notes of cereals and crackers, accompanied by mildly citric, slightly grassy and delicately piney hops; moderately dry and mildly hop bitter finish with lasting fruity notes of citrus and grapefruit. Despite its low abv surprisingly tasty. 18.IV.17","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
2739,"2017-02-17",3.2,"Plechovka: Pale golden with a greenish sheen, hazy, loose medium-sized white head, that quickly collapses; dryish fruity and grainy-dusty nose with slight metallic tinge, but mainly with distinctive citrussy to piney hoppy traces; moderate bitter-sweet flavour, astonishingly not very light bodied; fresh citrussy and grapefruity finish with subdued traces of pale malt.

2739,"2017-02-05",2.9,"A pint can @ Home.
Aroma: not very intense aromas of malts and grains. Hints of grass, citrus zest.
Appearance: light straw yellow color with above average head thickness. Perfectly white foam made of middle-to-big sized bubbles. Low retention. Low Brussels lacing. Slightly hazy.
Taste: low-to-medium sweetness, low bitterness, low sourness. Flavors of malts, grains, with hints of honey, citrus zest.
Palate: light body, watery texture, average carbonation, short and not very dry and bitter finish of malts and grains with a touch of honey and citrus zest.
Overall: good appearance, not very intense aromas nor flavors. Not very complex. Almost nothing more except some malts and grains flavors and aromas. No hints of hops. Despite of this, its very refreshing and extremely drinkable and its quite tasty to be a lager.","Pontevedra, SPAIN","GoddamnNoise"
2739,"2017-02-05",3.3,"Picked this one up at my go-to craftbeer Disney world, State Line Liquors in Elkton. MD. Crystal clear straw color with light, quickly dissipating white head and a touch of light lacing. Faint aroma of lemon zest and lightly toasted biscuit. Flavor doesnt stray from a typical crisp lager. A bit of malt, granola, no noticeable hop presence. Very clean, quick, dry finish. If youre a fan of the style you probably wont be disappointed.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"
2739,"2016-11-20",3.3,"Can from Gambrinus. Pours a clear, light straw with 2 fingers of foam that lingers. Light crackery malt, honey and citrus. Clean and light, body a bit thin. Prickly bitterness.

2739,"2016-11-04",3.2,"16 ounce can from Wine Warehouse, 5/31/16. Hazy pale golden, large foamy white head. Good retention. Aroma of pale malt and lemon juice. The taste is grapefruit, pale bready malt. Medium bodied, high carbonation, mild lingering spice.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2739,"2016-08-10",3.9,"16 ounce can - $4.49 at Hop City in Atlanta, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a nearly clear, pale yellow body with an inch of white suds.

Smell: Thin hints of grain, lightly sweet-scented cereal, minute herb and some citrusy, lightly fruity touches of lemon and lime.

Taste: A light-handed touch of pale malts glazed with a cereal sweetness. Zesty citrus, a thin measure of dried, spicy-minded herb. Lightly bitter. Drying finish, fairly crisp, fairly clean. Scant, fleeting grassiness lingering in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Wickedly overpriced, though a nice lager.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

2739,"2016-05-19",3.6,"Can in Seattle. Confusing packaging, and guess what, confusing beer. Clearish gold yellow, rising gray foam. Fruity, forward malts and hops. Metallic dry lager hits a nice dry note. Overall, just not sure how to contextualize this beer, but it is doing a lot of things right. Bready yeast, a bit heavier than a pils might go, but still easily drinkable. Punches with some hops, but remains clean like a fresh, new-age (india) pale lager. Id like to drink some more of this, in the right context.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
2739,"2016-05-03",3.4,"Pint can with no sign of dating into a stange.
A: Slightly hazy bubbly pale yellow with a slight head and almost no lace. (no, not drinking from the damn can)
S: White bread nose with a slight whiff of lemon.
T: Lemon punch at first sip. Slightly sour malt note lingers along with a bit of pith at the end.
M: Light, dry and refreshing with average carbonation and clean finish. Nice.
O: Good light lager overall and a great summer ponder but way overpriced @ $15/4 plus points taken for no dating.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","malvrich"

Smooth ple German malt and Pilsner grains on the flavor, light grassy hops, and a crisp Pilsner body. Very clean and crisp. A better Pilsner than actual German pilsners.

2739,"2015-12-03",3.9,"Purchased at Bottles and Cans in Chicago, IL; enjoyed at home on a Thursday night after getting my teeth cleaned while watching football. Appearance is a pale relatively clear yellow with a moderate white head. Aroma is heavy on the yeast, light hay, smells good though.

2739,"2015-11-24",2.6,"#can, consumed in my dining room.
Pours a very pale golden color with a small & quickly disappearing head. 

The aroma... is sort of odd. It smells like tires and flowers. But more like tires.

The flavor is fine enough, neither decidedly dry nor sweet with a good bit of graininess and a reasonable bitterness. This has some floral hops, some corn flakes & some herbal stuff. 

Its really sort of all over the place, and not really in a good way. Cmon, most lagers associated with Stillwater are pretty great... I had way higher expectations here.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2739,"2015-11-22",3.4,"16oz can for $3.49. Filtered orange-tan body, big foamy white head. A pretty straightforward lager, nice mellow grainy malt tones. Grassy, spicy noble hops. Not so far removed from a standard European lager. Pretty well made, but not really a beer the premium price point kind of baffles me. OK.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
2739,"2015-11-22",3.6,"Can:
Clear, light gold with a frothy white head.
Grain, light citrus aroma.
Taste is slightly tart, light lemon/grapefruit and grain malt....a pinch of salt.
Fairly substantial grassy hop bitter.
Very enjoyable and full-flavoured.....drinks heavier than 4% would suggest.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2739,"2015-11-20",2.1,"473ml can. What the fuck makes a lager trendy or not? Atg and stillwater have some of the worst marketing in the business (save atgs brown note). Pretty clear golden pour, fizzy frothy white head. Aroma is farty, salty, citrus, herbs, spice. Flavor is dry and grainy, very grainy, but dry. Surprising at the hoppy smell and just grain husk flavor with acidity in the finish. Not great. Edit after more drinks this stuff is just putrid, toddler lager.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2739,"2015-11-18",3.8,"16 ounce can into lager glass; no can dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon zest, lime, orange peel, light apple, cracker, bread, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, lime, orange peel, light apple, cracker, bread, herbal, light pepper, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, lime, cracker, bread, light pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness as well. Very clean on lager flavors with minimal yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very good hoppy pale lager style. All around good robustness and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2739,"2015-10-25",2.9,"16 oz can from Dutchs. Pours a clear golden color with a small, disappearing white head. The aroma has sweet, grainy malts, corn, sulfur, citrus, a bit strange really. The flavor has the typical pale lager blah, with more citrus and some mild earthy bitterness to the finish, I wish I would have looked to see what this was before I bought it, nothing I would revisit.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2739,"2015-10-24",3.0,"From the can. Corn and malt aromas. Dry with salty sourdough pretzel and toast and marmalade front to back. Bitter earth finish. Leans toward the flavor of a gose - dont think thats what they were looking for.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
2739,"2015-10-23",2.6,"16 oz. can purchased at Kittery 7-Eleven. Crystal clear gold color with ample amounts of carbonation. Aroma is pretty plain, lager yeast and rice. No hops, I am serious. Where are the hops?

The flavor is pale grain, straw and white baked bread. I know this can is not old. However, no telling how long it took to travel to the state of Maine. Just very bland.

When I read ""Trendy lager"" on a can I was really expecting this to be highly hopped. To me all this is a standard adjunct lager without any character. I am majorly disappointed.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2739,"2015-10-16",3.5,"16oz can, from Dutchs. As a big fan of Stillwaters Yacht, Ive got high hopes for this one.. Can here looks like a print, but its actually a wrap. Clear golden color. Great finger of white head, initially. Fades to a kind of bubbly thin amount, leaving frothy webs of lace. Good bready doughy malt, bit of sulfur. Touch of egg. Little weird initially, but not so noticeable as I start into my sandwich, and the beer has had a chance to sit and warm up a bit. Less hoppy than Yacht I think (one of the hashtags on the label is #dryhopped), but still a decent amount of hop for a 4% lager. Great citrus. Medium body, drinks a bit more full than youd expect for 4%. Dry finish. Touch of tang. Lighter kind of soft carbonation. Moderate sweet taste, lighter bitter, dry finish. Solid overall... Will probably have to revisit. I think a session rotating between Yacht and this needs to happen in my future... Now if only either of these beers were dated?","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
