Black in color with early but not sustained tan head and lacing. Aroma is a chocolate masterpiece with subtle, soft notes of coffee. Taste is a well balanced and so so soft and beautiful. Great combination of chocolate and coffee with a little initial bitterness offset by a welcomed sweetness. Hard to describe how well Alesmith has executed the mouthfeel of this one. Excellent effort.

3484,"2017-01-10",4.1,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is chocolate, coffee and coconut. The coconut and chocolate are most prevalent with coffee being secondary. Lighter roast notes with some alcohol spice. Some light fruitiness from the coffee. 
Pours black with a medium sized, thick, mocha head that recedes steadily to a thin film that lingers on the edges. Light lacing and moderately long legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with nice chocolate notes and some lighter roast characteristics. Medium coconut notes with a lighter coffee note. The coffee is mellow and somewhat fruity with a light nuttiness that compliments the coconut nicely. Medium bitterness and some light alcohol spice. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied and creamy with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium ow alcohol warmth. 
Overall, the beer is a nice coconut coffee stout. The coconut notes are nice and well pronounced without coming across as suntan lotion. Coffee is fairly light , but that allows it to work well with the coconut. Alcohol is well hidden. The alcohol level is right in my preferred range; not too light, but strong enough to carry the big stout.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3484,"2016-11-30",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Guss house on November 04. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a nice dark, dark brown, maybe a light black, with a thicker light tan head with a couple spots of lace as it falls down. The aroma is very fake coconut oil and chocolate. There is a big time coffee on the back end, and it does carry somewhat of a chocolatey latte thing. The fake is pretty surprising with it. The flavor is a little more balanced. There is a good coconut addition to the chocolate and coffee with a hint of vanilla trying to poke through the roast. Its not bad, but there isnt quite the excellent balance I was hoping for. The mouth feel is a little thin and definitely light. There is a softer carbonation and a lingeringly coconut oil and chocolate coffee finish. Not terrible, but it needs to be a little better.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3484,"2016-08-28",3.8,"Pours as black as the night with a very stable mocha brown head, revealing lots of big bubbles.

Smells of sugary vanilla extract, amped up by sweetened coconut and pleasantly earthy, flowery coffee. Packs lots of milk chocolate, a whiff of licorice and burned malts. The aromas do come well together though, creating a tropical dessert impression.

Drinks outstandingly smooth, soft on the tongue with a great chocolate creaminess. This coates the bigger body of the beer very well, makes it smooth and pleasant to drink, with a late coffee dryness.

Tastes of earthy, wooden and dry coffee from the very beginning, getting coated by the creamy mouthfeel, which opens up the palate to sweet caramel malts. Faint coconut, vanilla beans and bitter chocolate with a late, roasty dryness add perfectly to the complexity of the beers appearance. Finishes with more chocolate, no coconut nor vanilla, licorice and an awesome interplay between wooden dry coffee and toasty malts, soothed by whipped cream. 

Coffee for days in this with the other adjuncts playing a minor role. They are doubtlessly recognizable on the nose, while they do not really contribute to the flavors, mainly due to the prominent coffee. Apart from the adjunct overload, the coffee infusion is indeed very enjoyable.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3484,"2016-06-20",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2016 Seasonal (yearly) variation on the old Speedway with Hawaiian coffee, coconut and vanilla - Ive seen this one pop up in specialized craft beer pubs and shops throughout the Low Countries lately and was excited to finally get my hands on a glass, from draft at Gollem in Antwerp. Thinnish but dense and creamy, stable, mocha coloured, lacing head on top of a black beer revealing its deep burgundy hue in the last drops. The aroma is among the most divine that ever reached my nostrils: intensely perfumed with coffee liqueur, warm chocolate sauce, a ton of vanilla, espresso, candied orange, mocha ice cream, nougat, kahlua, hint leather, some vague dried meat and indeed a hint of lovely coconut sweetness. Intense taste starting with brief and non-cloying candied sweetness balanced with a light, dim sourishness and subtle umami, all packed together in a dense and absolutely delicious way. Softish carbonation and, as expected, very thick and viscous, oily body; thick layers of chocolate malt bittersweetness are balanced with caramelly sweetness at the front and roasted coffee bitterness at the back, but the sweetness prevailed, further enhanced by the wave of vanilla and the whiff of coconut; spicy hops and delicate coffee aromas, along with warming but noble cognac-like alcohol bring all these sensations to a completely satisfactory ending. This is way more impressive to me than I could ever imagine... I cannot find a single flaw in this, this beer is as rich and opulent as it could have been, hugely aromatic, with a perfect balance of flavors from the first drop to the last. I hesitate to give it a perfect score - a rarity for me - but there may still be a slightly better Speedway version around somewhere (however unlikely this seems to me now). By any standard, this is a universal masterpiece of brewing art and by far the best of - sometimes already very impressive - AleSmith beers I had till now.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Body reminds me of just a really good bottle of regular Speedway. Coffee is well integrated and not exhibiting anything out of the ordinary. Coconut wouldnt be detected at all if I wasnt looking for it. Soft front palate ends with a bit of a metallic bite. Odd. Regardless, its a long shot from coconut vanilla Speedways casks from previous Grand Prix and Million Zillion Speedway events. Could pass for just a really good batch of the regular. To be fair, maybe immediately upon release, this variant really popped. But I was out of the country and picked up my bottles a few weeks later than I would have normally. Still, that is pretty damn quick for the adjuncts to fall off. Sad face.Second bottle sampled a few months later had a stickier Twizzlers nose.

Taste is medium sweet with lots of coconut again, roasted malt, luscious malts, chocolate, again some alcohol but here it doesnt feel boozy but just bring a nice warming presence, mild fruitiness and mild coffee bitterness. Medium to full body. Smooth carbonation. Perfect velvety and fluffy mouthfeel with a wonderful coconut finish and a bit of alcohol warmth. Its not the most complex Speedway Stout variant or the one with the deepest and richest malts - though theres still more complexity and malt depth than in most other stout - but it showcase the coconut in such an elegant way and has a nearly perfect mouthfeel that its hard to not appreciate it.

Learning about a keg being tapped in the area I made weekend plans immediately. The drive was worth it - this takes regular Speedway Stout to an entirely new level. It would be great to try a few more varieties in the future as they trickle eastwards.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep oily black core rests heavily below snaky legs. Light tropical notes are unexpected above the typical coffee, malt, and chocolate of the world class base.

Flavor / Palate - Dark chocolate, raspberries, and mango warm the throat. Next comes candy bars, pineapple, and Laffy Taffy. The overall impression feels like drinking a beach resort on Maui. The big boozy finish reminds you that the beer isnt one to mess with. I cant wait to try a few more varieties.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3484,"2016-03-11",3.7,"(From notes; tasted 12/23/2015). Draft at Taste of Tops in Tempe, AZ. The aroma features soft, sweet coconut (thankfully lacking the harsh artificial character that ruins so many coconut-infused stouts) with dark roasted malt, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and a minor tone of earthy coffee. It pours about like nearly all Speedway variants: dark brown with a lovely beige head. The toasted coconut drives the taste, and while its not overpowering at all, it comes darn close to completely masking the coffee notes that make regular Speedway so enjoyable. The vanilla is a bit more prominent in the flavor than in the nose; a nutty taste pops up late. A decent stout, but it falls quite short of the other delicious Speedway versions. Id take the Jamaica Blue Mountain, Kopi Luwak and Vietnamese versions over this one any day.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

Black body with a beige head.
Rich aroma and flavour, with roasted malt, caramel malt, coffee, liquorice, smoke and coconut. Rather sweet taste with heavy bitterness. Noticeable warming alcohol. The finish is mostly alcohol, and not as bitter as one would expect. 
Full body with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation.

Full-bodied complex beer with a lot of nuances. The regular Speedway Stout is one of my favourite beers, and while this is nearly as good, the coconut does not improve upon it.","Århus, DENMARK","Echon"

Growler pours with a deep dark near black body that supports a nice light brown head of foam. The aroma offers up a blend of dark roasted coffee, an unmistakable nuttiness, some dark roasted malts and a coconut sensation now and then. The taste is smooth and rich and just another level of yum. I get rich oily slightly earthy coffee blended with a thin ribbon of velvety chocolate and then some sweetened nuttiness. The coconut works so well here and the vanilla seems to be lost in the shuffle but that hasnt taken anything away from the experience. It leaves a pleasing coffee roasted sort of nutty and mildly coconut sensation behind into the after taste.

3484,"2015-12-13",4.1,"Draft pour on tap at Villains Chicago (tChicago, IL). Exciting find locally. Pours deep dark luscious opaque black pour. Dark and ominous, murky middle with touches of brownish glow at times on edges and bottom. A cakey darker brown head atop is sizable, dark with nice creamy layer sustaining a bit. Frothy film laces fair enough throughout. Aromas present a rich creamy coconut sweetness, jabs of cool, sweet vanilla beans, jabs of coffee and cocoa nibs. Earth, roasty and toasty malts meet caramel, some toffee, Nilla wafers. A richer coconut nectar sweetness coats the senses as it settles down. Rich and luxurious, the vanilla and cocoa bitterness present potent support, but in the end a rich coconut sweetness, shaved and rich, and coffee roasty life with sweetener rue the day. Initial is rich and creamy at first, some nice sweetness and caramel meet richer coconut, soft vanilla creaminess, cocoa nib. Some bitterness, roasty coffee, a bit acrid and earthy with jabs of firm bitter coffee. Espresso is a touch creamy, but the roast and bitterness, touch of ABV warmth grows as cuts through that flavor and richer sweetness up front. Backend continues with this appeal, flipping the Script if you will with more roasty and bitter appeal. Earth, bitterness and coffee appeal meet some lingering black malt firmness beneath, the sweeter coconut and vanilla front end a fleeting feel at this point. A touch of creaminess, the coconut never truly dying off. A fun blend of flavors and profiles, flipping the Script fron the nose and front end that end up melding in a neat way. Toasty and roasty elements are firm and potent, making sure that sweeter treatment never interferes or overwhelms, but still offers some punchy appeal. In the end, as with Speedway, its really all about the coffee. The coconut element is just there to intice you up front and on the nose. Very pretty pour, alluring nose, with good flavors, nice contrast as we move on as opposed to just being sweet. Fun stuff. Further into the glass you get more coconut into the backend and finish, lingering around a bit more which is a pleasant play, once the palate adjust to that onslaught of rich and bitter roasty coffee and nib. Impressive stuff. You are working with Speedway to begin with but this adds a bit of something overall.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3484,"2015-12-10",4.3,"Draft to snifter at Cappys. Pours dark brown to black in color with a small, creamy khaki colored head. The aroma and flavor have big coconut over layers of chocolate and coffee, milk chocolate, hints of dark chocolate, some dark fruit, earthy coffee, yet another solid treatment of a great base beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
3484,"2015-12-10",4.4,"5-ounce draft at Urge Gastropub. Pours black with dark brown foam that actually leaves nice lacing in the little tulip glass. AROMA has really nice toasted coconut right away, dark aged earthy coffee beans, vanilla bean, lightly burnt fudge browniesomewhat reminiscent of a Mounds bar. FLAVOR of creamy vanilla-infused coffee beans with the coffee character being nicely rich/earthy (without being overly strong and espresso-like); the coconut comes in nicely as you near the finish along with a little bit of alcohol burn. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Perhaps a bit more boozy than most other Speedway variants I have had (though this is not barrel aged), but otherwise really excellent. Love that the coconut comes through so strongly here as many other such beers are challenged in this area (looking at you Stone with your IPA and Aloha Plenty).

3484,"2015-12-05",4.5,"On tap at Growler Guys SE location in Portland. Colour...onyx black with a thin ecru head. Nose...opulent with burnt coconut and heavy bodied coffee with cream. There also notes of chocolate and oak. Palate...sweet, but not overly so, with bittersweet chocolate, freshly shaved coconut and lightly charred coconut. The mid palate is tannic, dry and frothy with robust americano flavours and coffee Nips. The finish is long and brims with boozy Mounds bars.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
3484,"2015-12-05",4.2,"Keg @ Happy Gnome. Somewhat hazy deep brown with a prominent tan head. Nose is full of vanilla and coffee. Sweet and substantial chocolate syrup. Ash. Toasted coconut and marzipan. Flavor is pretty decadent. Chocolate covered espresso. Brown sugar and vanilla bean. Hazelnit coffee creamer. Toasted coffee bitterness. Extremely fat and luxuriously creamy. Quite oily. Soft csrbonation. This is a winner.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

3484,"2015-11-27",4.6,"Pitch black color. Dark brown head. Deep dark chocolate, coconut and vanilla and coffee in the background, which is actually quit appealing. The cocunut is the star of the show, on top of kau coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, just to well layered, so well integrated, a work of art if there ever was one. The coconut and vanilla with dark chocolate just linger and linger in the mouth. Absolutely the best Speedway stout.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

Flavour is heavy on the coconut, followed by vanilla and restrained coffee. The coconut steals the show. The coffee is rather restrained in this variant. Wonderful stuff, though far from my favourite Speedway variant.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

3484,"2015-11-21",3.7,"Bottle. The pour is black with little head. The aroma is mostly chocolate and malt, maybe a hint of coconut. The taste is thick, and more of a standard stout than anything else. I dont get much coconut or vanilla, at least not as much as I would like. A very good stout though.","Troy, Michigan, USA","ICEatALAMO"
3484,"2015-11-20",5.0,"On tap at Pacific Wine Merchants in Upland. So lucky to have this gem on tap locally. Poured a dark black pour with tan head. Damn this beer is no joke. It was great cold but as it warmed over 20 minutes I couldnt stop smelling it. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, coconut, and vanilla swirled in the back of my mouth. As it warmed even more and I swirled it..I could smell some pineapple in there which was interesting but damn. This is everything I love in one beer. Reminded me of a girl scout Samoa cookie. Thanks for making this Alesmith!","Lake Arrowhead, California, USA","JoeTheYounger"
3484,"2015-11-19",3.9,"Draft. Pours near black with a beige head. Mild coffee, vanilla, moderate sweetness, some hints of coconut-like fruity notes, and lingering roasted malts. Like all the other Speedway varietals Ive had, its rich and delicious.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
3484,"2015-11-19",4.5,"Tap @ Toronado. Aroma of coconut, chocolate, and vanilla. Dark black color with light head and lacing. The coconut hits you're taste buds like Mike Tyson with a nice, creamy coffee and chocolate finish. I could drink this everyday and still complain about its availability.
