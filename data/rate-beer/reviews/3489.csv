3489,"2017-01-30",3.7,"Cask Pint at Cask Pub & Kitchen, Pimlico, London in May 2010 - Very dark brown. Roast malty (caramel, some chocolate). Fruity (dark fruits, berries and citrus). Some grassy hops are evident. Bitter hoppy malty throughout with a lingering citrusy bitter finish. Very tasty. Hoppy for a Mild. Super beer! (2010-05)","SW London, Greater London, ENGLAND","john44"
3489,"2012-08-07",3.8,"On cask at the Speaker, Westminster dispensed into a pint glass (Dec 11).

A mid brown colour with a small head that had vanished after 4 or 5 sips.

Smelt very hoppy, citrus nose, light malts and nuts, maybe another fruit (of the dried variety) or perhaps mild spices. Smelt a lot like the Hophead!

Tastes akin to Hophead but earthier and more emphasis on malt and nut, maybe a smidge of toffee/caramel, but similar hoppy pleasanteries!

Mouthfeel was fine. Hophead in a brown winters jacket !","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
3489,"2012-04-05",3.8,"My first ever visit to The Southampton Arms (London) and one of the many cask offerings was this beer: my third beer of a slow Saturday afternoon session was a hand-pulled pint of this, poured into an old dimpled pint mug, like all the cask ales are in this pub.

I like a good Dark Mild now and again, this fitted the bill nicely. Dark brown with an off-white wisp of bubbles on top it looked your typical beer of that style.

Roast/toasted malts in the nose, coffee and toffee like with some slightly burnt bits in the smells too.

The taste is also malts all the way, again roasted/toasted with some dried fruit and malt loaf flavours coming through as well. The finish is fairly dry and the beer is far from sweet, the hops coming into their own towards the end of each gulp (you dont sip Mild).

Not the richest or thickest Dark Mild body wise, but very enjoyable non-the-less.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

It has a very nice hop aroma (score between 7 and 8), and the flavor mixes both powerful caramel and hops; there is dark chocolate too. The final is long, with the dark caramel turning into roasted malt and the hop resins as well. And you don’t even notice the low alcohol (maybe only because of the dry and lean mouthfeel at the end). Hop is the key here. Satisfying, very good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

Dark ruby brown colour.

Very fruity this mild. Rich deep flavours. A very full taste for the low %. One of the best Milds of the festival :)","Derby, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","DeepBlack"

What a way to start the beer fest off, with this delicious brew.  Toasty dark malts, with a lovely Turkish delight, lychee flavour throughout. Hoppy for a mild, flowery and aromatic, in fact doesn’t really taste like any other mild i’ve had, only 3.8%ABV which is a shock, because theres quite a decent amount of body and flavour.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
3489,"2004-06-28",4.2,"Catford Fest. Gravity. Apple and pale malt aroma. Turkish delight rose water and lychee flavours. Stunning! Fragrant, aromatic hops. A wild mild! Duff now joins the posse and the drinking rate will increase.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
3489,"2004-06-21",3.6,"Reddish colour - not that dark. Distinctly floral aroma, reminiscent of rose water. Not exactly what youd expect in a mild, but very appealing. Supple roast malt flavour, with some sweetness. Smooth texture. Finishes quite dry and bitter. Rather hoppy for a mild. Not typical, but impressive.

3489,"2004-02-19",3.0,"Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London.  Cooper coloured, with a white speckled head. Dissipating. Certainly some reddish colour as well. Unusual style of a beer for a mild, however this has been verified with Rob Jones the owner/brewer at Dark Star and it certainly is a mild according to him. The flavour starts with a soft malty, caramel opening, the more traditional Mild like flavours, only to finish with a moderate-big bitter kicker. Ive certainly had bitters more mild then this. Tradition light mild is the consensus from the very learned drinking community at the Wenlock today at lunch.","Sydney, Greater London, AUSTRALIA","Spiesy"

Dark brown, red, thin malty head. A good stab this at producing a flavourfull mild. Strong maltiness with a fruity (Plum?) overtone. Easy drinking, plenty of body.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
