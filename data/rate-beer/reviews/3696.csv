3696,"2016-03-29",3.7,"Very nice sweet barrel quality to this. Bourbon aged but almost smells and tastes like brandy. Lots of alcohol evident in the aroma and flavor, more than the ABV would indicate. Sweet and sharp.","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"

Chewy. Toasted grain. Croissant. Full body, soft carb. Lacks balance.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

The description caught my eye and imagination. A robust beer feels more like a twist on a barrel aged imperial stout than your average Irish ale. If a regular version of this exists I would love to sample it side by side for comparisons sake.

Aroma / Appearance - A ruby red base shimmers and glistens like melted chocolate. Beige head bobs on the surface with a creamy film. Oak, vanilla, malts, and red vines fend for themselves against a mellow backdrop of creamy barrel aging.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy malts blend with vanilla and chocolate in a smooth mixture. The bourbon rises to the top like a heady imperial stout and eventually overwhelms the rest. The results taste better than I expected but this experiment should be one that few brewers try until they have a handle on other more mainline recipes.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3696,"2014-11-04",3.5,"An attractively dense, regal mahogany hued pour. The nose is lacquered in bourbon. Butterscotch, toffee, strawberry, and saltwater taffy. Subversively strong heat is apparent, with wooden, mossy malts representing the base style.

The taste is densely sugared. Brown sugar syrup, caramel, red currant jam. The alcohol presence is not as noticeable here; these projects to extract complex barrel flavors without the accompanying booze seem to be working for Hammerheart. It can seem too sweet at times, but cloying isnt really the right term in this case. 

The palate is luxurious with pitch perfect carbonation that rises to the surface near the finish. Green apple notes mid palate are a reminder that this is consistently too sweet, maybe too reliant on barrel flavors over malt build. This might be best described as an intriguing idea with potential for greatness; the balance hasnt been achieved quite yet.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3696,"2014-10-19",4.2,"Growler. Thick nearly opaque brown with a quickly dissipating tan head. Light smokiness, wood, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar and pepper. The taste has a light shortbread sweetness that finishes dry and woody. Body is heavier with a syrupy feel. Very smooth, this was our favorite of four tried at the brewery.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"

Taste had a mix of caramel, toffee, smoke and ashy into lots of bourbon, booze, and oak, slight vanilla in there, finishing fairly sweet, bourbon-forward.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
3696,"2014-01-28",3.5,"Tap at Hammerheart. Pours dark red with minimal tan head. Aroma is woody bourbon, caramel and vanilla. The taste is not as good as the aroma, sugar, caramal, bourbon, meh. Somewhat thin palate, I thought. Didnt get the vanilla on it.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"

3696,"2013-09-02",4.1,"Sampled on draught at the brewerys tap room in Lino Lakes, Minnesota. Pours a clear dark ruby amber colored brew with a creamy beige head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma of a lightly smoked English-style barley wine, a hint of peat, coconut and a hint of bourbon. Taste is quite smooth and medium bodied, flavors of lightly smoked barleywine, a hint of raisin, peat, and some caramel. Finish continues a smooth profile, semi-sweet with some caramel, light raisin, peat and very little bourbon. Nice treatment to their regular Dublin Raid.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
