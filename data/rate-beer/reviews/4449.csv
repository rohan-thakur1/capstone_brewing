4449,"2017-01-30",3.5,"750mL bottled 3/25/16, drunk 12/21/16.Bright, cherry-red body has some deeper auburn hues, a good clarity and a medium-sized, beige and pink-flecked off-white head showing moderate retention.The nose delivers an immediate wallop of strong, juicy, sweet, rich strawberry and punchy acetic acid. It softens somewhat as lactic and brett acids lighten things, though the sweet element never fully dissipates. Lots of jammy fruits with some light minerality and woolen funk do give slight notions of a lambic but the acidity is still very powerful and messy.In the flavor its again powerfully jammy, with intense strawberry sugar hitting you quickly followed by intense acetic acid adding a vinegar-like sour element. Carbonation is low, could be a bit more tight and this really exacerbates the sweet and sour intensity. I applaud how much fruit flavor theyve pumped in to this thing; for what its worth, the fruit is very authentic, but this beer is just too messy still. Seems like theyve brewed this for the long haul. Will have to revisit some time down the road. I will say its decidedly not terribly lambic-y and just comes off much like an American sour. Rating is to the Lambic style, however, with a little leniency given for its young age.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

>>> An authentic Belgian lambic character and a wonderfully intense but delicate wild strawberries presence combines for what is most certainly the best strawberry flavored beer I have tried so far. 

+  Like the other beers from the Grrrz series, this is the real deal and taste more authentic than many Belgian lambics 
+  The wild strawberries presence is really intense, but its never overwhelming and theres no sign at all of these weird rubber notes theres so often in strawberry flavored beers 
+  Its not acetic at all... in fact theres even some funk and mineral presence that you often get from authentic Belgian lambics 
+  Everything in this beer screams freshness from the strawberry aroma to the mouthfeel 
+  Carbonation is pinpoint and the dryness gives this beer an amazing drinkability

Flavors:  Tons of wild strawberries, mild funk, brettanomyces, herbal notes, mineral character, mild spiciness.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
