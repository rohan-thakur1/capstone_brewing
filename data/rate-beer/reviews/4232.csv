Little cloudy amber to pale beige beer, small irregular white head, little stable, bit adhesive. Aroma: lots and lots of grapefruit, citrus, very fruity, more grapefruit, passion fruit. MF: soft carbon, medium to light body. Taste: juicy, lots and lots of grapefruit, acidic, citrus, pretty sour, lemony. Aftertaste: lemony, bit watery, lots of grapefruit. Weird how it tastes more like grapefruit than like passion fruit or guava.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"

4232,"2017-03-02",3.8,"From crowler shared at Ratebeer Best awards and bottle-share. Hazy golden orange color with white to off white head.

Medium oily body with soft carbonation.","GREECE","rouhlas"
4232,"2017-03-01",3.5,"Can shared by BuckeyeBoy at RBBWG. Moussy, egg-white, stable head over a hazy golden beer. Aroma of fresh pink grapefruit juice, blood orange, lime, sourdough, buttermilk, unripe gooseberries, plum, passion fruit. Extremely fruity onset, a basket of fresh grapefruit juice, guava and passion fruit, starfruit soapiness, unripe stonefruit sourness, minerally side notes, medium carbo, supple mouthfeel. Smooth middle on a lightly bready and soapy-wheaty basis, fruit juice effect flows over this completely and leads to a homemade lemonade-like ending, almost Radler-ish even, lots of real guava and passion fruit effects but the citrus juice factor remains till the very end. Interesting beer, basically a light-bodied Berliner Weisse drenched in lemonade-like soda fruitiness with sweetishness built on a mildly sour basis, very refreshing. I can imagine drinking gallons of this ice cold on a hot summer day. The almost over the top fruitiness sets it apart from most other Berliner Weisses, even the ones made with fruit - ignoring the old Berlin tradition of pouring sweet syrup in them.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4232,"2017-02-28",3.2,"Sampled at the RBBWG 2017. Thnx for sharing, everyone ! Pours rather unclear blonde, no real head. Smell is floral, toilet cleaner. Taste is mild sour, very fruity. Natural, yet the combo really is soapy to me.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
4232,"2017-02-26",3.7,"Thank you BuckeyeBoy! 473 ml. can sampled @ RBBWG VI (2017). Canned 25 JAN 2017. Hazy orange, creamy white. Smells like mildly sour Fanta, lemonade, puckering, artificial soda. Taste is sour lactic Fanta, basic sour, taste is all lemonade fruit, stupidly sour Fanta like, chemical, orange, tropical fruit, lactic basic. Body is likewise Fanta. This is basically lemonade, not bad but very comical, pretty much a mildly sour Fanta.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
4232,"2017-02-23",3.8,"Can - Guava and tropical notes. Cloudy gold with a decent white head. Much like th nose with a touch of sourness. Fruity and nice.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
4232,"2017-02-23",3.5,"500mL bottle, pours a cloudy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma bursts of tropical fruits, especially passionfruit, with so much juice. Flavour is extremely juicy, with lightly tart passionfruit, lots of juiciness and moderate acidity. Very fruity and juicy, with a lightly tart and acidic finish. Solid.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4232,"2017-02-23",3.9,"Cloudy, no head, dull tan. On the nose, heavy fruit. Passion fruit is the strongest, but Im impressed that I also get both the orange and the guava. The guava comes out more on the nose, almost superseding the passionfruit. Tartness is medium, straight up kettle sour. Im enjoying it. Nothing Berilner about it, just a kettle sour.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4232,"2017-02-21",3.8,"[1/28/17] Bottle/Can/Crowler/Growler at a bottle share at Flamingo Hotel in Santa Rosa. Cloudy yellow. Big fruity aroma, orange, passion fruit, tart, lactic, juicy fruitiness. Really good and refreshing.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
4232,"2017-02-18",4.0,"Poured from a 16 oz can. 
Aroma is very fruity with a strong Hawaiian Punch character to it. Light wheat notes. Hints of acidity. 
Pours a hazy, pale golden straw color with a small white head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers for a bit. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor has a medium light acidity with some light sweetness. Acidity isnt sharp at all and is well rounded. Lots of tropical fruit notes with mango, papaya, pineapple and some light citrus notes. Hints of wheat. 
Mouthfeel is medium light to light bodied with medium to medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really easy drinking beer that is exactly what it tries to be. Tons of tropical fruit character that very closely mimics Hawaiian Punch.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

4232,"2017-02-03",3.7,"Crowler. Pours a hazy pink with medium off white head that diminishes quickly. The aroma is berry, guava, passionfruit, dough. Thin body, similar flavors to nose, juicy, tart, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
4232,"2017-01-30",3.9,"Draught at Ale Arsenal. Pours a hazy golden-orange with creamy white head. Aroma is tropical fruit and minimal tartness in the background. Flavor is sweet mixture of tropical fruit and citrus, with overt sour funk aspects. Very tasty.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
4232,"2017-01-30",3.8,"Pint can. The beer is a hazy orange color. Its clouded through. Smallish white head, fairly fizzy. No lacing. Its another fruit juice kettle sour. Very refreshing, quite tasty if you like the fruit. There is a slight grainy off note, as seems to be fairly typical of kettle sours, but the fruit flavor largely hides it. Passionfruit, orange and guava juice are all front and center. Theres a hefty twist of lime on top of that combo. Like a recent Temescal kettle sour, it reminds me of a fancy fruit juice water kefir drink. Light feel with a bit of graininess. Theres not much complexity and no funk depth, but the fruit flavors are quite nice.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
4232,"2016-11-25",4.8,"Smell is nice passion fruit and funk. Taste is super nice passion fruit and guava followed by mild yeast. Medium body, medium carbonation, and very mild foam. Very drinkable and very delicious.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
4232,"2016-11-10",4.1,"16oz can pour from ISOBeers (San Jose, CA). Pours a hazy golden dulled hue, darker middle and firmer hazy body. Dulled colors, frothy bubbly whitish head atop sticks around as a skant film, decent ringer, laces ok overall. Aromas are rich potent juice, lots of guava, citrus and the cooler, darker passionfruit appeal onto the backend and finish. Lactic kick, yogurt, and bready malts fall behind as the fruit additions are potent, lively, almost overwhelming. Fresh, vibrant, juicy stuff. Initial is a bit more even keeled, bready and dry with some guava tartness, sweeter orange and tangerine essence melds with that darker sweet complex telltale passionfruit. A bit more tart, fuzzy as we round the corner. The flavors start slow but really work firmer, tart, bitter, juicy fruit melange comes on stronger. Juicy, twangy, lactic. A simply irresistible nose, solid pour, good flavors that catch on better as you get further into it. Tart, quenching, pretty crushable stuff. A bit more mellow on the lactic bent but overall I dig this.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
4232,"2016-10-21",3.7,"Bottle shared by beerboxer. Pours cloudy gold with a few white bubble and a tropical fruit aroma. There is a moderately sour pale malt flavor with a citrus finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
4232,"2016-09-24",3.8,"Can thanks to Brokensail. Pour is reddish orange, very hazy, small white head. Nose is fruit meat, juicy, lightly pissy. Very tropical and appealing aroma. Taste is initially sour but quickly shows fruit expression. Like the aroma, it is juicy, pulpy. Quenching, quickly finishes dry and tart. Really nice. Sourness is very nicely balanced by the fruit.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
4232,"2016-09-05",4.0,"Can care of Joey Nugs, thanks brah. Pours a hazy golden. The nose on this beer is so god damn intoxicating and tropical that its almost retarded. Bursting with heavy guava, passionfruit. pineapple, fruit punch, and dank juice. Flavor is a little more artificial tasting similar to some Hi-C. Tasty fruit punch alcohol beer. Somewhat gimmicky but I enjoyed the hell out of this. The smell reminded me of an old funky buddha berliner or a brewski juice box.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4232,"2016-08-24",4.3,"Location: On tap at Harrys Hofbrau in Redwood City, CA 
Aroma: Guava, Tangerine soda, very fruity
Taste: Loads of tropical fruits, effervescent citrus soda, nutty quality as well
Overall: This was amazing. Definitely full of flavor, complexity and extremely refreshing. Best Berliner Weisse Ive had.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"

4232,"2016-08-14",3.4,"Pink hued hazy lightly sour, salty, creamy, medium high effervescence, substantial acidity, nuts, grapefruit, kiwi, tropical aromas. Pretty fun but a bit too acidic.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
4232,"2016-08-05",3.9,"16 ounce can. It says 5% ABV on the can, which is noticeably lower than what its listed at... It pours a lightly hazed orange color with some pinkish hues and a disappearing off white head. The aroma is intense with fresh squeezed orange and tangerine. Some citrus peel. The guava and passionfruit have to be searched for to be found, but are there. Potently juicy on the nose. The flavor is pretty much the same. Massive tangerine and orange juice. I get more of the guava than passionfruit, but the orange really takes center stage. Light on the palate, but not watery at all. Theres a hint of natural fruity sweetness that off sets the strong tartness nicely. Not really any funk here. This one is all about the intense fruit character and light, refreshing, spritzy body. Mouthwatering. A great summer cooler.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
4232,"2016-07-11",4.0,"On tap @ Caps & Taps. Cloudy orange colored beer with some white foam. Smells like tropical juice, son. Huge passion fruit, pineapple juice, guava, and citrus zest. Actually decently restrained in terms of the sourness, more of a fruit forward beer, but still has a nice acidity and sourness to it. Slight sweetness, decent body, decent carbonation. Really intense beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
4232,"2016-04-25",3.9,"Tap at the brew pub. Pours pineapple juice appearance with a whiteish head. Tropical fruit aroma. Flavor is tart guava and orange. Refreshing as heck; a delight to drink. Excellent. Tho at 6.5% I think its far off the style.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
4232,"2015-11-02",3.7,"Had a couple of these on tap at the brewery about a month ago. Flavor was a lot of guava with some light maltiness and light tartness. Level of carbonation was low and body was medium.","California, USA","MattH"
4232,"2015-09-30",3.6,"On tap at Aptos St. Pours cloudy orange, medium off-white head dissipates with decent lacing. Aroma is fruity and tropical, passionfruit present for sure, perhaps some blood orange citrus notes along with lemon and wheat. Flavor is light tart, hints of residual sweetness, fruity. Medium body. Interesting.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
