2054,"2017-06-11",3.7,"Bottle from The Beer Mongers, Portland. Aroma is bready malt, sweet ripe fruits, apricot, yeast, spicy notes, mild candied fruits, peach, touch of pear, lightly floral.

2054,"2017-04-20",4.0,"Pours a warm honey gold with a medium white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma is nothing special: bread, a little yeast and malt and a slight sweet straw. Mouthfeel is generally thin yet a slight touch of viscosity. Bubbles are small and subtle. Taste is light and a bit sweet. A little sourdough bread touched with a hint of honey-apple sweetness. Not to get too cute but it tastes like sunshine through water. As the label says, this is an easy beer to be enjoyed on a lazy sunny afternoon. Pairing perfectly with a little Mt.

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, yeast, wood, fruit and bread.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, yeast, wood and fruit; ends slightly dry with bread.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Extremely good for how not intense it actually is. Probably lost a lot of hop flavours, but the aging adds a really rustic feeling to this beet at the same time.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Mouthfeel is light syrup.

Hops are noble in nature with solid bitter, which is barely there, so for me this is still malt balanced. Some spice and pepper in the finish which might be hops are rye.

2054,"2016-07-31",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2016 Older bottle bought online. Loose, milky, snow white, moussy head over an equally cloudy peach blonde beer with salmon pinkish hue. Aroma of ripe peach, banana peel, iron, red apple, old cookies, honey, canned pineapple, pear, white raspberry and a hint of onsetting rusty oxidation. Fruit sweet onset, very appleish, hints of peach, dried banana and dried apricot, softish carbo, honeyish, slick malt sweetness in the middle with a metallic zing to it somewhere, tad bready too, leading to a somewhat thin finish with only softly bittering, herbal, tea-like hops which do leave a slight peppery flavor after swallowing, but it is the overall apple-like sweetness which prevails, along with that obnoxious hint at oxidation. Clearly a ""bière de garde"" should be able to last longer than a few years in a cellar without oxidizing this much, but apart from that, this is, to me at least, not better than the classic northern French examples of the style. It has a certain straightforwardness and a Belgian yeast quality not unlike e.g. its La Choulette or Chti counterparts, but it feels too soft and sweet for the style, with too much yeastiness going on. Not entirely true to style and certainly one of the least interesting Lost Abbey beers for me.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

OCZY : piwo ma śliczniutki, delikatnie mętny kolor pomarańczowy. Piana jest spora o kolorze białym. 

NOS : piwo ma bardzo przyjemne i wyważone aromaty. Wyczuwam owocowe estry o nutach moreli i gruszki. Do tego siano, skórka pomarańcza, sok pomarańczowy, świeże zioła, surowe ciasto drożdżowe i tarta. 

USTA : piwo jest średnio gazowane o dosyć gęstej i tłustej konsystencji podobnej do mleka. 
Piwo jest średnio słodkie i wytrawne o nutach słodowych tarty i nasion wraz z nutami cierpkiej skórki pomarańczy i alkoholu. Słodkość również przypomina po prostu słodkość owocową, na przykład soku pomarańczowego. Po kilku łykach wyczuwam coraz bardziej owocowe nuty przypominające białe, słodkie i dojrzałe winogrona Muskat. Posmak piwa jest średnio trwały i przyjemny o nutach owoców i tarty : lekko estrowo kwaśny i słodki. 

ODCZUCIA : bardzo przyjemne estry i aksamitne w ustach ... to na pewno amerykański kraft interpretujący belgijski czy w tym przypadku francuski styl piwny. To jest piwo coś pomiędzy belgijskim blond i saison. Fajnie aromatyczny i łatwy w piciu. Mniam.

2054,"2012-12-26",2.9,"I had heard many good things about this beer... but I was somewhat disappointed by this. There was absolutely nothing bad about it, and I could tell that all the ingredients were of the highest quality, but the taste was simply too mild to keep my interest. The aftertaste and very nicely sparkling palate grew after several sips, but the flavour never developed for me. It had a very nice flavour, but I could not even discern the strongest of the flavours of this beer until I had drank nearly half of a 750ml bottle... The flavour is complex and wild, I wanted to like it (based on how much I love Orval and Dupont,) but it was simply too mild to impress me.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Listigovers"

Avant Garde appears a hazy, yellow straw color. There is a half inch of head that leaves a bit of lacing. The aroma is pleasant, with a mild funkiness. The beer has some nice herbal and tea characteristics. I do wish it was more funky and bold. I do not believe that the beer is aptly named, as it is simple and certainly not out of the ordinary or ""avant garde."" Worth a try, but not something to avidly seek out.

4.5 S: Im not sure how a biere de garde is different from a saison, but this smells like a saison mixed with a witbier. Barnyard funkiness with a light hay aroma. Coriander and pithy fruit rind. Grassy hops and peppery spiciness from the yeast. Light toasty maltiness. Not very complex, but wonderfully pleasant. 

4.5 T: Again, not overly complex, but really tasty. Barnyard funkiness with hay, grassy hops, and wild flowers. Light toastiness from the malts along with a subtle breadiness. Coriander and pepper spiciness. Very nice.

4.0 M: Lighter medium to medium body. Carbonation level works and is spritzy on the tongue. Extremely smooth as the yeast is not overbearing.

4.5 D: Best LA beer Ive had yet. This is a relatively simple, great tasting beer. I might actually pay what this costs regularly if it were available in my area.

2054,"2011-05-01",3.8,"750ml bottle from Luckyhank, thanks Brendan! Pours a cloudy, golden-orange colored body with a finger-width, frothy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is floral and perfume-like with a good amount of fruits and spices. Apples, pears, cherries, a touch of citrus, sweeter bready malts, clove, yeast, and caramel. Very bright, pleasant aroma. Flavor is pretty spicy with a light-medium bready malt balance. Lots of clove, yeast, a bit peppery, and some herbal hops. More apples, pears, cherries, and floral/perfume-like fruits with a touch of citrus. Some caramel comes in along with an earthy, herbal hopping before this finishes dry and spicy with a nice fruitiness and balancing bready malt. Light hop bitterness before leaving a fairly lengthy aftertaste. Medium, smooth body and creamy, somewhat high carbonation. Overall, a very enjoyable Bière de Garde. On the sweeter side, but not overly bready and there is a nice spiciness throughout to balance. Solid fruitiness and pleasant body as well. Good one.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

2054,"2011-04-21",2.9,"Bottle shared by Darrell at a recent tasting. Served in a snifter.

Pours a yellow-orange color with a white head and a moderate amount of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward quite a bit of grain and bread with some mild yeast presence and a touch of a farmhouse character. The taste is mostly just a bit of grainy malt without too much else. The finish is oddly dry and a bit too bitter. Not terribly drinkable.

2054,"2010-04-26",3.9,"Thanks! Poured into my Chimay chalice.

A-Body is a translucent dark gold hue. Pours with a 1 finger or so creamy white head that fades quickly to a thin collar. Some traces of lacing is left behind in the glass. Cloudiness is uniform and so thick that the body is nearly opaque.

S-Nose is very good. A balance of white grapes, raisins, and maybe pear upfront with a big accent of spiciness. A big dose of sweet, bready yeast provides a great background.

T-The taste upfront is mild and offers some mellow fruitiness accented by minimal spiciness. The sweet bready yeast so prominent can only be found when the brew is swished around over the palate a bit. The main character in the finish (and in the flavor overall) is a big bad floral hop bitterness. Below this bitterness is a nice balance of floral hop flavor, breadiness and a hint of spice. What lingers, surprisingly is a slight phenolic bitterness and alcohol warmth and nothing else.

M-Medium to high carbonation and medium weight body composed of sweet bready yeast and powdery spiciness.

D-This is a decent to pretty good beer. Not the best LA beer or Biere de Garde I have had but still a very interesting brew. I wish the taste were as good as the smell-but it falls short for me. Definitely worth a try.

The flavor is much sweeter with notes of caramel and brown sugar prevailing, and the yeasty bread notes coming through powerfully as well.

The first taste is initially pleasant enough, but is then discouragingly coppery and dankly bitter taste.  Yeah, its not bad, but its just not that good.  ABV isnt too high, so I dont think its just poorly disguised booze.  Mouthfeel is watery, and none of the pleasant-looking carbonation from the pour lingers into the palate.  Further tasting lessens some of that early unpleasantness and makes me think this brew just needed to breathe a bit?   Yes, that must have been it, because the metallic flavor is 99% gone, replaced again by that pleasant cider-esque flavor from the initial aroma.   With each additional sip the palate gets more complex and lingers nicely.   Some flavor of bananas is sneaking in early on, only to morph into a brandy quality by the end.  Ive come full circle.

2054,"2009-03-11",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2009 3/11/2009:  Okay, I am finally just going to come out and say it...  All of the Lost Abbey beers that I have had (mainstream releases) have been good, but they dont seem like anything special to me.  The beers are always right on for the style, but I just cant find anything overly unique or interesting about them.  Am I missing something?  I dont know.  Apparently I just dont fully know how to fully understand or appreciate Belgian beer styles and their nuances and complexities, but I have been saying that for years so that admission should be nothing new.  Other than having some honey sweetness and being floral and lightly spicy, there isnt much else specific I can call out.  The appearance is spot on (hazy gold with an off-white head) and I like the maltiness (toffee-ish and slightly fruity) with a good level of sweetness and an inviting and pleasing spicy and grassy hoppiness and mild bitterness in the finish.  Ill say it again, quite good but I dont see what the big deal is regarding the Lost Abbey brews.  That being said, they have some very attractive labels/packaging!  Now that I have said all of this stuff, the matliness and sweetness is really growing me!  Looks like I need to remove my foot from my mouth now...

2054,"2009-02-26",3.2,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2010 Bottle from Hi-Time. This is my first Lost Abbey product from Port Brewing. Pours an amberish color with a nice fluffy off-white head and some pretty good retention. The aroma is a grassy-hay scent along with strong malts and candy-like fruits. The strongest flavors here are funky and bready type of malts but theres quite a bit more going on, some of them subtle; a bit sweet, a little fruitiness, some spices, sour and tart in the finish. A lot of Saison type qualities. More alcohol shows than I would expect and Id prefer a little of that to hide better. Overall a good beer but perhaps not as good as the high expectaions I had. I do want to try more of these.  Re-rate 8/24/09.  Amber color, decent head, some retention but pretty good lacing.  Aroma is malty and very bready and doughy, light citrusy notes as well.  Flavors, oranges, bread, caramel, toffee, not bad but not as good as I remember partly because its semi-sticky sweet with an alcohol bite.  Slightly dry with a good amount of spice.

2054,"2009-02-26",4.0,"750ml bottle courtesy of KingG, thanks! the cork gave a very loud pop when I opened it but the head was not out of control. This has a nice light-orange color with some white bubble action. very subtle sweet honey on the nose, bready flavor with a bit of fruit on the tip of the tongue , oddly easier to drink than the Red Barn I had last night. As it warms the alcohol shows up a but the flavors really get stronger. This seems more refreshing despite the higher ABV, maybe its the lack of spiciness? In any case another interesting and worthwhile beer from Lost Abbey.

2054,"2009-02-25",3.0,"25.4 oz bottle from Binnys South Loop (Chicago, IL) that I had been storing for awhile. Popped in honor of getting all 4 of my trades out the door today. Whew! Pours a very nice gold with some darker orangish elements, light haze, and moderate white bubbly head that dissipates down to a film. Aromas are lightly fruity, belgian yeast lightly dances across the nose, with apple, spice, and light peach. Initial is medium bodied, but light on flavors. Light grain and belgian yeast are present with subtle apple, graininess, a bit of creaminess, and a touch of bitter, peach, and skunk in the finish. Despite not beng watery, this beer tastes as though it should be. Taste is far too subtle on the palate and leaves a bit of warm booze and bitterness on the aftertaste.

Its wonderful to come back to Colorado and see how distribution channels have changed in the previous 3 months.  Here I am at my favorite beer store (Davidsons) and suddenly theres Port and Lost Abbey beers - a whole lineup!  So I convinced my friends to make a stop there after dinner to pick up some lounging booze, and convinced one of them to split a Lost Abbey beer with me.  He chose the Avant Garde, which didnt look too exciting to me, confirmed in my tasting. A brown-orange beer with a pretty good head on top, an an aroma of toasted grains and hops.  The flavor was the same, featuring a dry and toasted grainy flavor with a really delicious dose of savory none-too-bitter hops and a long, relishing after taste.  But I expected more.  A lot more.  At $9.50 a bottle (not including tax) theres simply not enough of interest.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2054,"2008-10-19",3.7,"I don’t have a lot to compare this to, as this is the first Biere de Garde I’ve ever had.  I just brewed one, and figured that I should try a commercial example first.  I must say, I drank half the bottle out of a Belgian style tulip glass and it tasted a lot better than the second half, which I drank out of one of those Sam Adams ""perfect beer"" glasses.  
Appearance- Dark copper to orange color with very little head.  It was hazy, which did not clear as it warmed.
Aroma- very appealing, fruity with some citrus hops.
Taste- The aroma does not translate to taste.  The munich malt is very muted, with a bready taste that is very subtle.  As it warmed it took on a taste of dried fruit.  I definatley think that it is worth trying once, just drink it out of the appropriate glass.  Usually I think that glass stuff is bunk, not in this case though.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Dmalone102"

Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, off-white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy medium amber, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (grain, cookie), trace hops (herbs), lightly yeasty (mold, dough), with a strong note of peach, light note of lemon zest, hint of celery.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Suprisingly lackluster. Aroma reminds me a bit of a peach flavored American wheat, not at all of an authentic Biere de Garde. Flavor also seems like it has fruit juice added. Malt is kind of rough and raw, and there’s even a touch of vegetal character to it. Probably the worst Lost Abbey beer I have tried so far.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2054,"2008-06-09",3.6,"In short: A fruity Bière de Garde.  Highly drinkable.
How: Bottle, 750ml, about 8 months old
The look: Cloudy light golden body with a very small white head
In long: Somewhat sweet with crisp honey, very bready, some orange peels.  Quite a bit of fruity yeast esters with pineapples, mangos and apricots.  A bit dusty.  Nose and taste lack the farmhouse character of the good French Biere de Garde and there are a bit more fruity yeast flavours than usual but everything else feels very much French Bière de Garde.  Highly drinkable.  To me this to me is a mostly typical Bière de Garde but with a light nice Abbey Tripel twist.  A very good beer that doesnt stays mostly within the boundaries of the style, if all Avant-Garde would be that groundbreaking and innovative Home Alone would be considered experimental cinema.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Sorry, gang, I live on the fourth floor of an apartment, Im fresh out of cheese, and neither of my dead grandmothers ever owned an orchard, old or new!

Makes it kind of hard to ""relax and watch the evening arrive as the afternoon sun is consumed by the illuminating moon""? Especially since Im having it at midnight, as I look out the window at sparse lit skyscrapers of the downtown skyline, as motorists buzz home like bees on the freeway below

Gives notes of the wort you smell walking by a microbrewery  on a crisp morning. Tastes of the rind of orange fruits - tangerines or satsumas, definitely showing hops, but not at all overpowering. It manages to be both bright and complex - would pair perfectly with appetizers (fruit, bread, oil and balsamic, etc.).

2054,"2007-11-14",2.7,"Caged corked 750 ml. bottle, no bottling date, but I purchased this bottle over a year ago, blurb on the back label, sampled in a tulip glass. Sediment is visible at the bottom of the bottle.

Poured an cloudy burnt orange, with fine specks of sediments, nice size foamy creme colored head, decent retention, settled into a thin creamy lacing. Not much in the way of sticking.

This is missing the earthy mustiness and tart fruit smells that I love in the Bière de Garde style, probably the result from using their house lager yeast. Aromas of honey biscuits, banana bread, faint scents of oranges and lemons, and a light herbal leafy hop. I really dont smell any spiciness. Not a bad nose, but also kinda of a bland one.

Creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel, I would have like more of a airy feel, the carbonation fades a bit too much as youre consuming it. The fruit tastes have a watery mild tartness, oranges, lemon and banana. Lightly toasted malts, honey nutty grains and sweet bread. As in the aroma, the spiciness is barely noticeable. Towards the end softly herbal spicy hops emerge, helping to give this a dry finish. The alcohol is properly restrained, just a low fruity warmth in the palate.

For a Bière de Garde, or an Avant Garde for that matter, I feel this is just too mild, average tasting. This is the only disappointing ale Ive had from Lost Abbey, everything else has been first rate. Im sorry, but I wouldnt recommend this to anyone wanting to explore the Bière de Garde style.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"
2054,"2007-11-11",3.2,"Bottle, Irvine, CA. Hayish golden color, big thick white head. Nose is malty and yeasty with some earthiness. Flavor is malty with some acidity and yeastiness. Taste more like an abbey tripple than biere de garde as I know them. Pretty balanced brew, but not that special.","FINLAND","raymondwave"
2054,"2007-11-10",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Chewy bready malts and lingering spicy hops slowly tango on a lightly doughy yeast in this sumptuous and appeasingly honest Bière de Garde.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the hazy straw blond.
-The body is healthy and with the flavor profile creates an authentic Bière de Garde experience.
-The spicy hoppiness (Spalt?) is as present in the aroma as in the finish, balancing out the malty baguette throughout.
-Alcohol is not a player in the flavor profile; this is beautifully drinkable.
-I often get flavors which resemble vegetable broth notes in some Bière de Gardes; no idea how to describe them any differently.

Dont misread that - its a good thing.  Caramel & malt up front give way to some yeast and fruit.  A hint of clove comes in, mixed with alcohol.  The malt is almost German in its pronouncement.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Light carbonation. A slight stickiness on the palate. Some alcohol warmth, too.

Drinkability: There were times where AndoBrew and I thought ""What did we get ourselves into? This is never going to come together!!"" But when those wonderful smells start coming from the beer, when the flavors begin the meld, when the obscenities start flying, and the smiles start shining, we knew that it was all worth it.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

2054,"2007-05-17",4.1,"Translucent and pristine, clean glowing copper in color. A sudsy, praline tinted tan head rests like laundry foam an inch tall on top. Aroma revels in the bakery. Sourdough and buttered baguettes. A hint of caramel glistening bran sneaks in through the later whiffs while magnolias and semi-sugared bakers biscuits ride the limelight. Flavorful, bready bounty gives us some warm, doughy innards. Biscuit rapture has a slight herbal tint as magnolia sourdough reverently hums. Soft bitterness and butter flaked crepes. Creamy carbonation gives a full bodied flavor that slips out with the subtle stutters of tossed, doughy crust. Subtle honey suggestions. Golden sweet biscuits sweetly and wholesomely sing long into the afterlife. The pinnacle of working class beers. Many thanks for the bottle, tpkenned!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The first glasss aroma is a deep bread and earth, while the second glass is significanty spicier with a slight bitter pepper note.  Taste bready and slightly sweat at first, but not sugary, and soon joined by a dry yeast flavor and light but noticable hopping.  Occasionally theres a slight lemon rind taste poking through, but its picked up more by the sense of smell than taste.  These tastes carry the beer in the finish, making it even more dry, and that spicy pepper from the aroma comes back to finish this beer nicely.  Rather dry, but the body is really nice and creamy and drinkable, despite the full flavor.

The steady streamers formed a thin head that refused to go away.  The floral and hay aroma was delicate and gave subtle hints of orange peel, and an occasion whiff of earthy yeast.  The taste was sweeter than I was expecting, with a toasted maltyness similar to an American Amber Ale.  Spices were too light to provide a lot of balance, and there was no hop presence, so the malt pretty much dominated the palate.  It had a medium thick body and felt soft in the mouth, and was quite soothing.  A good beer to have in autumn, as the back side label seems to suggest.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

2054,"2007-01-16",3.9,"25 oz bottle, via trade, cant remember with who.  Pours a clear dark gold to light copper colored body under a foamy one finger off-white head with great retention.

Flavor is nice, bready malt, pretty crisp, with a little floral accent.  Finishes fairly dry with some light hoppiness and a little botanical perfumy flavor.  Kinda like those orchids that they garnish plates with at them fancy wedding receptions.  Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied and airy with pleasant active carbonation.  I quite liked this.  I read a few reviews of this and Im not sure where some folks are coming from saying that this was overly sweet and such.

There is a tone of fruit throughout before being led to a dryish woody and corky finish with just a dash of bitterness. The mouth feel is surprisingly sprite for the lack of head, dry and mineral aftertaste.

2054,"2006-11-08",3.9,"Pours with a frothy, initially three-finger thick, tan colored head that is a mix of tight and larger bubbles.  The head leaves a lacing pattern as it falls back into this brilliantly clear, lightly reddish tinged, amber colored beer.  The aroma has an enticing spiciness to it that is quite prominent as I pour this brew.  An interesting mix of aromatic notes are noticeable here; plum, apple, bready notes, caramelized bread crust, spicy notes of almost cinnamon, hints of berries and even a bit of cherry.  There is even a certain vinous quality that reminds me of a fruity, lightly sweet white or rose wine.  There is also something here that I want to describe as murky, though that is not quite right; it is approaching musty, but not quite.  I have always been interested in warm fermentation characteristics of lager yeasts and this is one of the more expressive commercial examples I have ever experienced (at least as far as the aroma is concerned).

The taste is sweet, but more from a fruitiness than an overabundance of residual malt sugars.  It is also quite quaffable and light on the palate.  A combination of the carbonation and the yeast derived spiciness give this beer a certain zesty zip.  Fruit notes of tart plums and aromatic apple varieties combine to give this a sweet, yet kind of of tart edge that is quite nice.  This beer is nicely malty at times with definite notes of caramelized malt and a biscuit-like bread quality that makes me think of freshly browned crusty hearth breads.  The warm fermentation temperatures are quite evident here, not only with the fruity notes but with the background phenolics, esters and higher alcohols which contribute a large portion of the flavor profile.

Ill admit to expecting a lot less from this brew, but this beer has inspired me to play around again with warm fermenting lager yeast strains.  I have had some interesting results with a certain San Francisco Lager yeasts at very warm temperatures in the past and I think that I will have to do some additional exploration of this.  The spiciness that is in this beer is what I remember from my experimentations with the San Francisco Lager yeast, and it makes me wonder did Tomme use that yeast here, or is this a characteristic of all Lager yeasts at warmer temperatures.

2054,"2006-09-29",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2014 2006 bottle drunk at Hop Devil Grill on 9/22/06.Not quite as much retention on the head as I was hoping for.  It dosent exactly blossom like a French/Belgian version and sit there implacable.  Rather, it fills up to about one-two fingers in height and then fairly steadily fades to cover, though the lacing is quite full and well-developed.  The beer itself is a light honey-almond, with streaks of pale gold and hay.  Medium-high clarity, leaving the sediment behind.  The head is white-to-off-white.  Finely carbonated bubbles rise steadily.Light perfume in the nose, perhaps wildflowers, lavendar, something like that, is quickly matched by a slight lemon tanginess as the rich, baked honey dough-like malts slowly surge forth.  Deeply bready/doughy and quite charming, albeit somewhat heavy.  Yeast abound, charmingly, quite authenticly, giving off notes of cinnamon, red apples and hard minerals.  Very strong aroma, no alcohol or flaws noted.Rich malt is encountered in the flavor.  Sweet doughy french bread, as Erway suggests, rustic and freshly baked.  It drips with honey and light caramel.  The sweetness certainly is not tame, and in that respect, perhaps the attenuation could be taken a bit higher.  But if you think of something like La Bavaisienne, which is incredibly sweet, it dosent seem to bother me.  Perhaps this malt isnt quite as interesting as that one.  It does grow quite bready and in combination with the moderate acidity and ester/phenol dryness, builds up on the palate without much to cleanse it.  Still, as usual, the mouthfeel is perfect.  Tight carbonation and a sumptuous, deep texture sooth the palate (after letting it breath sufficiently, of course).  Plenty of yeast to ponder on the finish with light pear/orange and maybe pineapple-like notes.  Very well-done, maybe Im not so crazy on the malt bill/type of malt and attenuation level, but its far from mediocre as some spoiled people I know might think.  ;)  7/4/7/4/142013 bottle drunk 2/8/14Good to revisit this one, being the first Lost Abbey I ever had and its even better than I remember!  More dry, with a light tartness and very lovely wood-like character.  Dusty/spicy hoppiness on the finish is peppery and dry while through the middle there is still that same perfuminess to it.  Wonderful texture and carbonation levels, as always, from Lost Abbey.  A pinch of alcohol felt on the end.  Upping it some.  7/5/8/4/15","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2054,"2006-09-26",3.6,"Bottle:  Courtesy of DarkElf via trade.  Moderately spicey aroma with cinnamon, pepper, ginger, and a hint of brown sugar.

2054,"2006-09-23",3.7,"Pours a nice amber body with a head that fades to a weather-pattern mist atop the beer. The aroma is lightly toasted bread crusts, a bit of apple fruitiness and some hops. This is a very relaxing beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
2054,"2006-09-15",3.7,"Bottle. Clear dull gold with a small head. A lighter version of the style. Dusty fruit aroma with notes of pineapple and bubblegum. Sweet and flavorful, fruity and biscuity.

2054,"2006-09-05",3.6,"Bottle at the Hop Devil Grill.  Thanks to Mens Journal I was able to score this beauty on the East Coast.  Pours very cloudy and murky yellow with orange tints.  Small head that quickly faded into lacing.  Aroma is very present - bubblegum like funk.  Some malty sweetness with some sourness.  Taste is a bit ordinary - hoppy, funky, belgiany with a tad of sweetness.  Average mouthfeel, a bit of bitterness.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2054,"2006-09-05",3.3,"Bottle. Rich amber beer with a thin off-white head. Spicy, sweet malt aroma. Spicy, yeasty, slight earthy flavor with malt backing and a touch of lemon. Lower carbonation than expected. Lingering yeast and spice. Not enough complexity or depth (and perhaps a lower carbonation took something out of the body).","Alamo, California, USA","bb"

A little light overall, I would like to see what age brings this one.","Virgina Beach, Virginia, USA","gputty"

2054,"2006-07-14",3.5,"750 ML Bottle, part of MJs ""rare beer"" club:  Lighty off white colored head, short lived, and orangey amber color that is lightly hazy.  Very grainy and with melanoidin malt aroma.  Light spicyness from yeast.  Crisp, tart aroma at first when chilled.  Light white grape juice fruit aroma as it starts to warm.   Perfumey alchohol esters.  Bready yeast malt w/ some hints of toastiness.  Well balanced flavor and lightly grainy at first, some toasty and what seems to bea light wheat malt flavor, but also lightly bready malt.  Finish is lightly bitter and herbal hop flavored that lasts into the lingering, toasty malt flavored aftertaste.  Higher medium carbonation, medium body, well hidden alcohol.  Not a bad beer, but it sort of lacks identity IMHO.  Ive resigned myself to the fact that Im not a biere de garde fan!","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

2054,"2006-06-19",3.3,"Yellow orange. Soapy, spaciously bubbled foam noisily crackles its way into a jagged-edged ring. Musty yeast aroma with baked apples, fresh hay, and caramel drenched nuts. Light touch of fragrant phenols and black pepper. Carbonation is prickly and expansive. Very airy, as well. Initially brash with a medicinal and alcoholic sweep. Nutty malts soon take foothold and beautifully complement the mustiness while taming the rough edges. Alcohol is extremely peppery and pointy, but the malts progressively gain definition and continue to soften its blow. Coarse mineral textures seemingly activate a fluffy Pilsner malt foundation. Sweetly floral hops and a nuanced nut- and hay-flavored  malt structure winds up being pummeled by a sharply peppery and alcoholic finish. No doubt this is on the right path, as the malt character shows flashes of extravagance, at times. Unfortunately, however, the loose and prickly carbonation fails to carry it with any sort of grace. Flavors also suffer from (slight) under-attenuation, overly sharp/peppery alcohol, and theres not enough aromatic cleanliness. They came close to nailing this.  Better luck next time.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2054,"2006-06-12",4.0,"Bottle from Patrick (bindpmc) Thanks!  Pours out a light brown color with a huge white head.  Cork almost blew off in my hand - theres a ton of CO2 in this one.  Taste is sweet and fruity, and full of carbonation.  Goes down very easy, almost could be chugged if it wasnt for the huge presence of Co2.  A very interesting beer, of a style that I am not very familiar with.  Much better than the last Biere de Garde I remember drinking.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

Not as good as Loirette ambree from Pigeonnelle in France.","scottsdale, Arizona, USA","footy"

Taste evokes more flowery notes, grains, ripe fruits, light grass, spices, and yeast notes. Slight tartness to this in spots as well. Body is well carbonated but still smooth. Overall it has a medium feel with a bit of dryness towards the end. Its leaning towards crisp. The finishes allows more fruit to come forth, flowers, dusty yeast notes, dough, grass, and light spices. Very nice!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

Sweet, floral aroma with strong wisps of perfume, honeysuckle, wheat and light alcohol.  Flavours are sour, grassy and filled with hints of iron, dust, bitter yeast (sourdough)I get the feeling that this is amazingly traditional  I can just image sitting in stone walled basement in the French countryside after a day wondering through the vineyards, sampling the winerys real treatvery nice.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
2054,"2006-05-24",3.9,"Clear amber body with an initially large, quickly diminishing, off-white head.  The aroma is interesting and rather unique in my experience.  Lots of grain, some light caramel sweetness, alcohol, light fruitiness, some unique spiciness that is kind of alcoholic and kind of coriander or grains of paradise-ish.  The aroma can be really nice, especially when the softer, underlying fruity elements come out.  The body is moderately full with nice liveliness from the tiny, active bubbles rising through out the experience.  The flavor is definitely malty with only a light sweet kick.  The grain and malt elements are strong, and show off a light caramel/brown sugar sweetness near the end, right as the light and earthy, Noble hop bitterness comes out.  This is a tasty beer.  I was kind of hoping to be absolutely wowed by this beer--by balance, aroma/flavor profile and sheer elegance.  It has all of the above, but just not to the level I was hoping.  Luckily, there are a couple of other bottles here that might just add some depth of character with a little time.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
