1687,"2017-04-07",4.5,"10/22/16. 12oz bottle brought down by family for this rating, but have had a good handful of times since. World class hefe! Hazy golden pour with a hint of range, great khaki head, awesome lacing. Fantastic aroma, soft wheat, a hint of banana, but not too much, melds perfectly with a touch of cream and a hint of clove. Smooth flavor, creamy, soft banana, pale malts, soft wheat, a hint of clove. Delicious! This makes me remember how much I used to love hefes! Maybe its time for breweries to take a step back from all the goofy BA garbage out there these days and make good, clean beer like this.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

1687,"2016-11-02",4.5,"Bubbler is like many New Glarus brews in how its unpretentious and simplistic yet its a masterful representation of the style. Bubbler pours effervescent yellow with a long-lasting, rich layer of foam. Banana, candy, clove, black pepper, and bread notes. Feel is creamy but also lively and sunny. Dry finish.

1687,"2016-09-17",3.7,"12 oz bottle courtesy Virby44. Pours a slightly hazy golden color and crowned by a thick head of eggshell foam that shows great retention. The aroma shows notes of soft wheat, spicy clove, banana, bubble gum, some sweet grainy malt, and the typical yeasty esters found in a Hefe. The flavor follows with the crisp wheat, banana, spicy clove, and yeast with a nice sweetness throughout with very little bitterness. Medium bodied with ample carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel that leads to a smooth ripe banana finish. Another solid Hefeweizen from the master Dan Carey, but just not quite to the level of Dancing Man Wheat.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

1687,"2016-08-19",3.6,"12oz bottle. 5/8/16 bottle date. Appearance: Light golden with a slight haze as the yeast was poured with the beer. Moderately thick white foam head holds for a few minutes. 

Aroma: Strong spicy clove, banana, and bubble gum. On the stronger side for the style. 

Taste: Light, grainy malt sweetness that transitions into a strog pear and light banana fruitiness. Bitterness is low. 

Mouthfeel: Body is medium, maybe on the lower side for the style, with a crisp, sharp carbonation. 

Finish: Malty, soft wheat sweetness lingers after the swallow with a strong pear retronasal fruitiness. 

Overall: Have to take into consideration that this beer has more than 3 months on a style that should be drank fresh...Aroma is strong and typically fruit forward for the style. Taste is nice and easy drinking, heavy on pear notes. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style, maybe due to age. Very nice Hefeweizen. Id like to taste this fresh as it may approve the appearance and mouthfeel","","TH28"

1687,"2016-08-11",4.0,"Bottle in the living room.
Pours a hazy yellow color with a big head & nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is yeasty & bready with a nice mild clove spiciness. Some light fruitiness of lemon zest and banana are well controlled and add to an appetizing bouquet. 

The flavor is classic Hefeweizen, the clove on banana thing is indeed central here but theres a light lemony tartness to the beer along with a low to style level of sweetness, far from dry but pleasantly miles from cloying with a refreshing bitterness to boot!

1687,"2016-08-04",4.1,"On tap at Glarner Stube in New Glarus. Hazy golden appearance with a white head. Aroma has white pepper, clove, lots of banana, and candy. Moderate high carbonation. Fairly dry. Very low bitterness. The flavor is in your face bubble gum, candy, vanilla, and banana. More aggressive flavors than Dancing Man. I tried it next to Dancing Man and preferred Dancing Man but this sure grows on me and is incredibly drinkable. Really solid but it is tough to justify buying this when Dancing Man is offered.

A cakey, creamy white head atop with a firm layer that remains and laces well. Aromas are fruity, estery banana, subtle bready and sweeter appeal with a mellow spiciness, earthy, subtle grass appeal. Initial is lighter than expected, a summery wheat body with subtle vamilla, decent estery pop. Banana, some dryness and spicy appeal quickly crops up. Some fruity appeal, lemon and banana jabs.

1687,"2016-07-13",4.1,"On tap at the brewery June 30th, and numerous bottles over the last month; currently drinking one from an Ayinger weizen glass. It pours an immense, just-off-white head atop a lightly hazy golden body; the head takes minutes to subside, and the appearance becomes a bit less turbid. I suppose most people not from southeastern Wisconsin are going to just think, ""Oh, Bubbler - like bubbegum, clever"". Well, yeah, but as I learned from my 9th grade English teacher who was from Milwaukee and helped inspire a lasting appreciation for literature in me (despite being a fairly incompetent teacher overall, in whose class marijuana was frequently sold, and who was mocked for his peculiar dress and manners - in retrospect, he kind of fit the profile of a child molester), ""Bubbler"" is slang for ""drinking fountain"" in his city of origin - much the way ""Tonic"" means ""soda"" in Rhode Island, its a weird slang term that has stayed within a very small geographic region. And certainly the Careys know that - heck maybe its even printed on the bottle though I can no longer read that fine print easily. Glasses are not needed to sniff the enticing, sweeter-than-usual aroma of bananas and vanilla and very soft gingerbread spiciness. On the tongue its also a bit softer than usual, though some dry herbal character impinges on the back end, just there to provide a slight pushback against the pillowy-soft, bready-sourdough and very full (especially on tap) body. In summary, though it could be a bit spicier and more forward in the aroma, this is still one of the better American hefes Ive had; I wasnt too crazy about it initially, but it has grown on me, and drinking a glass on the warm sunny patio at the magnificent brewery, looking down on that perfect green Wisconsin summer valley - well, I havent had many better beer drinking days in a long time.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

1687,"2016-07-10",3.4,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 7-9-16. Pours a cloudy bronze with a large amount of cream-colored head. Murky appearance. Yeasty, wheaten aroma features a bubblegum scent. Also lemon and cherry. Quite pleasant in aroma, as hefeweizens tend to be, although the smell would benefit from being stronger. Pleasant, mineral, wheaten taste. Light body. Frothy and almost chewy in the palate. Refreshing. Overall, a good hefeweizen, as I would expect from New Glarus. Its not an incredible beer by any means, but it hits the spot on a hot day and is both pleasantly aromatic and tasty, even if Id appreciate more from both the aroma and the flavor. It is not in any way special, merely a good representation of the style (which should be irrelevant in the hedonic rating system), and it is nowhere close to deserving the absurdly high average rating it has on this site. New Glarus is a great brewery, but theres no need to pretend that every new classic-style beer it releases is special in its own right.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Medium bodied with little alcohol presence, the blend is solid, and the carbonation is constant. Finishes sweet and lightly citric with the tangy spice all the way down.

Nose is, well, somewhat muted - and this isnt necessarily bad, but I was anticipating something a bit more bold. Sweet malts (wheat is evident), hint of clove...smack of bubble gum (not overpowering)...it is inviting if you get in there, but you need to be looking for the aroma. Flavor can be best described as dancing man light, and I say this in the best possible way - it is very, very nicely done...the yeastiness comes through...mild spice...a bit more bubble-gummy at the finish...some banana...and a splash of floral hops.
