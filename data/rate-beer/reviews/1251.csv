1251,"2007-03-17",3.5,"Sampled February 2007
Very well carbonated, in fact it overflows my glass with four-fingers of head in my glass.  The head is a light brownish tan color and it sits atop a dark, almost black beer that shows clear, purple, amber highlights when held up to the light.  The aroma is rich and chewy and this is quite evident even as I pour the brew.  Sweet melanoid rich malt notes yield notes of molasses, toffee, concentrated raisin, fig and even prune notes.  I would guess that this beer has some age to it as the malt character seems to have picked up some oxidative notes around the edges, at this stage it seems to only add to the complexity; a touch of port, maybe a hint of sherry and some chalky malt notes are what seem most attributable to this.

The taste is not nearly as big as the aroma would have suggested.  I think that the apparent age may have reduced the flavors a bit here.  Still there is lots of malt left that adds quite a bit of complexity.  Lightly sweet up front, this malt sweetness accentuates a raisin / fig note.  The finish has a touch of chalky malt character to it and perhaps a hint of roast malt character.  The malt really reminds me of caramelized, sweetened fruit.  The body is quite a bit lighter than I expected, even the big malt characters here seem indicative of a brew with more body than this.  In the end this is quite a tasty brew, though I have a feeling it was a bit more decadent in a brewery fresh state.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The body is a ominous crimson/black but the head is fluffy and tan. A large aroma of coco and pumpernickel bread, with a hint of coconut. I cant believe how chocolaty this beer is its almost too sweet for my taste. There is a faint coffee bitterness on the back end but overall molasses sweetness. The palate is soft and substantial for a lager. Nice beer no doubt, but Doppel Bock is not my preference.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Jojoba teams with burgundy to emit some mild tannic activity.  Black licorice meets campfire roasted prunes.  Drumming semi-sweet chocolate yields rum raisin and black currant jam, embodying flavors of broiled brown sugar with special B intonations.

Its also got good presentation -- for the record, this came in a big, black bottle (dark brown but the liquid madr it pitch black) with a gold printing straight on the bottle. To continue, its got bread-like flavors, a hint of citric sour and a nice smooth feel. Nice!","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
