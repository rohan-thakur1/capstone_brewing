Dominated by herbal and citrus flavours with the malt and dried fruit taking too much of a back seat for me. But it is tasty. Quite bitter with some moderate roasted flavours à la old ales.

So Im revisiting this one and here are both my reviews for contrast:

First blush.  Tapped:
""Tapped out a deep red brown coming in at about 16ºSRM. Head of nice tan orange foam.

The nose was languorously malty with nice toasted cereal aroma. 

The palate had a light hop balance, with an even finish. A good beer, but not outstanding.""

Second fling.  Poured from bottle:
5.9%ABV.  English hopped ale.

Poured out of a rusty Amber.  16ºSRM.

Nose has some nice citrus character along the lines of a ripe Valencia orange with a lot of sweet-sour aroma laced with some refreshing florals.

Mouthfeel is carbonated.  The palate is dominated by sweet buttery flavors which are almost immediately remiscent for me of a Mars bar, with milk chocolate,  toffee, butterscotch and nougat.  There are a ton of rich roasted barley malt flavors of black bread, Horlicks, Maltesers.

Finish is medium long wth hop bitterness which is pronounced.  Not much in the way of florals in the finish.

1281,"2010-08-22",3.5,"Cask conditioned	handpump	Sheffield Tap	Sheffield.  A reddish brown coloured beer with an off-white head and lacing.  Very much a US amber ale type beer in its nose with good hops and sweet fruity berry notes.  Pretty sweet in the mouth and quite restrained.  Certainly not the hop monster the pump clip promises.  Again I have to wonder whether the tight sparkler has helped diminish some of the flavours?  The hops taste almost safe.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
1281,"2010-08-21",3.6,"2nd August 2010. Thornbridge event at the Cask & Kitchen.  Hazy deep red beer. Light soft palate. Nice malt - very well integrated with some grassy piney hops that are not over bitter and also impart some orange and grapefruit. Harrisoni finds a little stawberry shortcake in there - and of course now I can taste it on the back of the tongue as well. (Nice one Ian).",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
1281,"2010-08-17",3.6,"2010-08-01. Crisp red amber body with a  modest beige head and light lace. 3+ Smooth lovely fruity character, modest rounded citrus, light biscuity touches, modest bitterness throughout. 7+ Aroma is fruity, mild orange and citrus, muted malt accents. Smooth average palate is lightly carbonated. Less assertive than my preference but very well balanced and very drinkable. Cask at CASK Pub and Kitchen, London","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
1281,"2010-08-15",3.2,"A Mes rate. Cask at the Cask.Very clean amber red coloured with a thin off white head. Far too bready on the malt for me. Well hopped and plenty of good English green stuff is showing but its all just overpowered by the bread. Something slightly phenolic about it too. An interesting enough beer just not quite working for me.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1281,"2010-08-14",3.9,"Hand pulled cask at the C&K, Pimlico. Amber red with a beige head. Initially rather malty and sweet but resinous fruity hops cut through almost immediately to tantalise the back of the tongue. One of many amazing beers on a very memorable evening.","Harrow, Greater London, ENGLAND","bobinlondon"
1281,"2010-08-09",3.5,"Cask at Cask pub and kitchen, Pimlico, London. An amber coloured pour with a reasonable creamy head. Good aroma of hops and malt. Tastes malty, hoppy, fruity, roasty, a hint of caramel. Clearly a US inspired beer but with a UK twist. Very easy to drink, I really liked this one.","Northwood, Greater London, ENGLAND","evergreen0199"
1281,"2010-08-06",2.7,"Cask (handpull) at Cask and Kitchen, Pimlico. An oddity, this; a good depth to the fruity feel but the spicy-herbal mix reminded me too much of an old cough drop left in a sticky wrapper and gone all warm. Hoppy of sorts, perhaps just a little too much going on. A restless child of a beer, seemingly not too content with its lot.","Derby, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","haddonsman"
1281,"2010-08-04",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2011 From cask. Pours clear and golden amber with a small off-white to slight tan head. Aroma is mild fruity and malty.  Fruity, roasted malt and slight caramelish. Bitter and fruity into a dry bitter finish. Nice one.7-4-7-4-14=3.6

50 cL bottle @ ACBF2011. Pours hazy dark orange to brown with a small tan head. Aroma is fruity, slight yeasty and mild phenolic. Dry malty, slight sweet caramelish and mild phenolic.

1281,"2010-08-03",3.7,"Cask; Pub and Kitchen, Pimlico, Jans birthday extravaganza!! Looks like a mild ale; ruby red in appearance, fantastic lacing, creamy white head, low particles, soft carbanation, nice nutty malt texture, blackcurrent fruits, well conditioned and excellent for the Autumn months.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"
1281,"2010-08-03",4.2,"Cask via handpump at CASK Pub & Kitchen on 2nd August 2010. Russet with yellow-tinged thin foam head. Hoppy aroma with a touch of aniseed spice in the nose. Sharply hoppy in main kick with a bitter aftertaste. A few berry fruits in background and a light textured, agreeable mouthfeel making the beer easy to drink despite its strength. A well crafted ale, a privilege to enjoy.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","ladnewton"
