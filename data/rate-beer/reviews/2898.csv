2898,"2016-07-19",3.7,"From notes. Enjoyed this at a tasting at Andrews house for my first tasting with the Ann Arbor crew on July 8! 375 mL bottle. The pour is a decently thick darker brown, almost muddy, with a lighter tan head that falls down with no lace. The aroma is full of dark fruits, specifically raisin. There is a huge amount of cinnamon on the inhale that is pretty well balanced with the fruit. A light caramel exists, and there is a little oaky vanilla on the back end. The flavor carries a little more barrel and dark fruit to it. The plum and raisin are nice, and the cinnamon is still large, though tones down a bit. The mouth feel is thicker with a nice carbonation and a lingeringly fruity cinnamon finish. This is an interesting balance.

2898,"2016-01-20",4.4,"Ez a főzde véleményem és eddigi tapasztalataim szerint az egyik legeredetibb és legkiemelkedőbb minőségű söröket gyártó márka, amellyel rendszeresen összehoz a jószerencse, így nyerve egyre nagyobb bizonyosságot az előző állítás hitelessége felől. Egy ital, amely ráadásul quadrupel, sőt mi több, a mazsolával főzött és valóban kimagasló Judgement Day alapjaira épül, emellett azonban bourbon hordóban tökéletesítik, fahéjjal és chilivel teszik izgalmassá, nagyobb meglepetést okozna, ha nem lenne lenyűgöző, mint azzal, ha annak találnánk. Erre, mint már említettem, a Lost Abbey név a garancia, s bár messze állok attól, hogy a főzde fizetett reklámanyagának összeállításában működjek közre e bejegyzéssel, nyilvánvalóan nem is szorulnak rá az ilyesmire. Pezsgő hanggal hömpölyög elő az üvegből, színe mély, sejtelmes és gazdag, akárcsak az illatai, amelyekhez foghatóval csak a legkülönlegesebb darabok rendelkeznek. Amellett, hogy megőrzi belga hangulatát, a diós-aszalványos, súlyos és ódon jegyek komótos aromáját, a bourbon kókuszos és fűszeres karakterét éppoly magától értetődően szívja magába a szerkezet, mintha e komponensek egymástól mindig is elválaszthatatlanok lettek volna. Nem kell több pár milliliternél, hogy ez a harmónia az ízében is visszaigazolást nyerjen a kortyolása során, a lágy és nyugodt, malátától telt, pirított csonthéjasok és füge, datolya jegyei által lerakott alapokat elegáns vonalakkal színezi ki a whiskey vaníliás-kókuszos zamata, a képet pedig egy remekül eltalált mértékben, alig észrevehető módon jelenlévő pikánsság, lágy, nem metszően csípőskés jelleg és egy ehhez remekül passzoló fahéjas fűszeresség kelti életre. Ehhez tényleg nincs mit hozzáfűzni, vérbeli különlegesség, melynek elismeréséhez még csak az elnézőbb énünkre sincs szükség.","HUNGARY","adster"

Theres a touch of bitterness in the flavor, but only if you look for it. Very heavy body, creamy, thick, silky, and just a little warming. This beer is simply fantastic - gloriously aromatic, with a luxurious mouthfeel, and very sweet flavor, without being cloying. This hits all the high points of a great barrel aged beer, without the pitfalls of booziness. I would buy this again, without hesitation.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"

Anyway, deep brown, verging on black pour with some head and nice irregular lacing. Aroma is coconut and mulling spices. Molasses and raisins to boot. Smells perfect for this onset of fall weather -- this is the kind of seasonal drinking I can get behind. Taste is sweet, chocolate cinnamon coconut covered raisins (so, you know, basically the nose but with more flair). But unlike raisinets, Im 100% behind this.

2898,"2014-11-25",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2015 Bottle into a tulip. Fizzy as soda -- the bubbles pop away after just a few seconds. The liquid below is the darkest purple. Bourbon is easily the most pronounced aromatic, though a swirl does throw off smooth cocoa, vanilla bean, raisin and a dash of sharp cinnamon. Maybe a subtle teriyaki note as well. In the flavor, we get a little more of the dark fruits Judgment Day is known for, along with pronounced whiskey flavor and big, peppery alcohol. The problem is the carbonation level -- its extremely high, fizzing up with every small movement. Really gets in the way of the enjoyment of this beer. 

On draft about seven months later, this is a completely different beer. The aromas like a cinnamon oatmeal raisin cookie, stuffed with savory dark fruits and spice. Raisins and figs are all over the flavor, covering up the huge alcohol content skillfully while strong cinnamon settles in at the finish. Dont know if its the time in the keg or the dialed-in carbonation level, but this is miles better than the bottled version. The scores have been adjusted accordingly.","","PartyFowle"

Pours thick with a raisin colored reddish body, not head to speak of but had some carbonation. Nose is very herbal with some holiday cakes and cookies, cinnamon and egg nog and other dark fruits. Very thick and viscous this has a lot of body, nice carbonation mouthfeel. The cinnamon and raisin and whiskey are hugely dominant with a lot of sweet burnt caramelized sugar taste and sweet malts. Cherry, raisin, peach and nutmeg as well. Theres a ton of flavor here. It still burns a little after 2 years in the bottle. Id like a bit less spice but maybe as the weather drops, this is a nice warming beer.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

2898,"2014-08-24",2.6,"A quickly fading beige head fades over the dull dark brown pour. Fruity and spicy, heady nose. Rich and supremely sweet offering reminiscent of the nutmeg and cinnamon raisin French Toast I had for breakfast, but add a melted chocolate and chili bar in there. Oatmealy texture, chewy and cakey. It does not burn the palate from the get go, but quickly warms you up and that alcohol pairs with the chilies. Minty, coconut and vanilla hints contribute more than a little credibility to the statement that this is one complex beast, but the heat is a bit annoying and the Judgment Days usual inviting fruitiness is lost in there. One thing is for sure, in spite of its sojourn in a bourbon barrel, it has not lost much body. Ironically, this is one beer that you would tend to want to roll over your tongue to explore its multi-faceted flavors, but the burn makes you swallow promptly and you end up drinking it faster than youd have thought. Guess they call that drinkability. In the end, there are too many ideas thrown into that bottle for it to create an ensemble you would want to visit frequently.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

I can definitely see the ""oatmeal cookie"" vibe in the aroma. Lots of barrel presence on the palate. Big time whiskey soaked wooden staves, warming the throat & lightly tannic on the tongue. Raisin is more dominant with a huge, malty underbody. Dark cacao, roast, faint vanilla, star anise, & bourbon. Cinnamon is not as present, but can be found if you try hard enough. Some chili warmth in the aftertaste is noticeable & compounds with the heft & booziness of the beer to spark a huge warming sensation all the way down to your belly. Possibly a little over carbonated, a little prickly & tannic at times, but not a huge hinderance. Overall, a pretty nice beer with lots going on.

The nose was expressive notes of barrel induced coconut, bourbon, raisin, and caramel sweetness, with a more subdued nature to the spice as cinnamon & light pepper, that seemed to dwell on the fringe almost as an afterthought, but understandably so, with everything else going on. The taste mimicked these notes well, adding moderate bitterness, decent enough effervescence to successfully project the flavor, and quite boozy, but warming alcohol.

Aroma is a balanced blend of malt, yeast and bourbon. Moderate toffee, dark caramel and chocolate with light roast. Fruit esters of raisin and prune. Some alcohol and spice as it warms.
Pours a fairly murky brown with a slightly tan head that recedes fairly quickly. Light lacing and moderate legs.
Flavor similar but with more chili and spice. Nice toffee and dark caramel with some chocolate and light roast. Fairly sweet and slightly sticky. Moderate raisin notes with some prune and fig. Medium low chili flavor with medium light spice. Low bitterness to balance to sweetness. Some alcohol in finish; more as it warms. Moderately high bourbon throughout but not overpowering. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth.
