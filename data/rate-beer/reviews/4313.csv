6 odd aroma, sweet malts, sticky hops

Rerate of (7:4:7:4:14=3.6) Cask (Kuikka, Helsinki)
Rich reddy brown, small persistent foamy head. Beautiful hoppy aroma despite being served cold. Both fruity aromatic hops and more traditional bitter ones. Full-bodied, smooth palate. Gingery and fruity hoppy retronasals. Big bitter finish. Drying and resiny, lasting for a long time. Quite well balanced. Perhaps the hops are a touch too dominant and aggressive - over-egged, one might say - so misses out on the wow factor.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Excellent Oakham hoppage in the aroma  with a slight sweaty note that I can only describe as the smell of a good woman after a sexual extravaganza. Backed up by some awesome bready malt in the background and a faint whiff of booze makes it a glorious olfactory experience. The flavour is pretty much identical. Yes I can taste lady bits... And all the rest of it too. Damn. This is just excellent. Good developing bitterness in the finish, giving it excellent length. Wonderfully drinkable considering the reasonable happy making factor. Awesome stuff. Hats off to Tom for getting this to the glass in such fine form.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

4313,"2008-02-20",4.1,"Gravity, Merton Winter Beer festival. Copper, lasting cream froth head. Lots of green hop aroma: melon, juniper cinnamon. Resiny hop bitterness, appealingly rough and aggressive. Melon flavor in a way that seems to capture the chin-dripping stickiness of ripe musk melon, while being simultaneously a crisply dry beer. Thats impossible, but yet...there it is! This is dangerous stuff! We may have created a hole in the space-time continuum! 28 days... 6 hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds.

The hops  surge forward on first inquisitive whiff absolutely flooding the aroma with some glorious citrusness, oakiness its clean, fresh and stunning. The flavour gun is also set to stun as well, your mouth and tastebuds absolutely hammered with a juicy, hoppy frenzy of crisp grapefruit, bitterness hits but then in an instant a lovely sweet malty toffee underbelly rescues this and provides a stunning balance to this beer. This has the most incredible amount of flavours present and really is one superb beer, my beer of the festival by some considerable margin.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
4313,"2008-02-16",4.5,"Cask conditioned at Merton Winter Beer Festival 08. Brown beer with white head. Now this is the real deal for me, with Oakham you are going to get the hops and this has enough to be an IPA, leafy, fresh, peppery with an oily perfume character.

The hops are strong, but are in harmony with the malts. Id love to know what malts and hops are used here, and in what proportion, because they work together so well. Fascinating aroma of damp leather and lilies, great mouthful of honeyed toffee malt with a scintillating rush of electric citric hops full of flowers and fruit.
