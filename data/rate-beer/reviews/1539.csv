1539,"2013-09-29",3.0,"Hoppy conifer nose, pine, cedar and pepper notes. Very surprising for a witbeer. Nice resinous hops.

Taste: Attack is dominated by hops with a lot of fir, pine and other conifer notes. Very particular that bitterness is happening at the beginning of tasting process and not at finish. Very few malt sugars. Texture is extremely thin and watery. Do not expect a typical wheat beer. It is closer to a light IPA or pale ale with a lot of conifer notes.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","dandeman"

Aroma is hop-forward, tropical fruit and citrus peel and a bit of resin, a little grain in there but that big cask aroma overpowers the wheat. Flavour is not really as punchy as the aroma, with light tropical fruit and citrus and a bit of malt sweetness giving way to slight lemony character, wheat, a bit of hop resin bitterness, and a dry finish.

Mostly hop aromas: citrus and pine. Some sweet malts, caramel-like. I was surprised that there was no banana-esters (until I actually read the label); different kind of yeast. Pours a hazy amber with a nice 1cm head. Some sediment fluttered around. Pretty average looking. Grapefruit hops dominate with some pine. Caramel sweetness comes through with some bready notes. A resinous finish ends it off. Pretty well mixed stuff, though I think the complexity may have mellowed out with the age (from what I recall of the Toronto Festival of Beer cask last year). A pretty light brew overall, refreshing. Interesting take on a wheat ale. Hops and malt were well balanced.","Ontario, CANADA","scantron"

1539,"2011-12-27",3.9,"Miami Weiss. Aside from being a very clever play on words, its Toronto brewery Great Lakes take on an American weiss beer. Clearly a homage to the 1980s, I feel like I need to turn on some Rick Astley while drinking it. Thats what people did in the 1980s when they partied right? Pours a hazy yellow. Aroma is fresh hops and citrus. Flavor has pepper and strong grapefruit notes. For a weiss beer its strong on hops. Miami Weiss is a refreshing and different take on the style, and great for summer time bbqs. Just dont turn up the Rick Astley too loud after youve had a few.

The aroma is grapefruit out the wah-zoo, thats about it, but thats not necessarily a complaint. The flavour starts out with a resiny hop drop kick of grapefruit, there is some pale malts, biscuit, and such, but its really stands in the back ground while the grapefruit goes to town. Its a good concept, and its not a bad beer, but its a little rough, the hops are too prevalent and a little harsh. Hop Sun was considerably better balanced version of this hoppy weiss.

Initial flavour is classic weissbier, grassy, wheat then the hops arrive and that IPA bitterness. Citrus notes abound, lemons. Excellent palate, smooth with enough bubbles to carry the flavour and tingle the taste buds but without significant carbonation. Agreed, label is a bit of a shocker, nice pun though...","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Phatman"
1539,"2011-10-16",3.9,"My Bottom Line :  
Tropical fruit galore ride this svelte Pale Ales wheat subtleties, as bitter hop resins claim the palate for the long run. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam covers the cloudy beige. 
-The citrusy hop nose is as compelling as the crisp mouthfeel.
-This is obviously super drinkable for hopheads.
-Mouthfeel is polished; the dryness increases drinkability too.
-This is one of the ugliest labels Ive seen in a while.

1539,"2011-09-01",3.0,"650mL bottle from the Lickbow. Pours a semi-hazed yellow with a large white fluffy head that laces the glass well. Aroma is straight up hops, not much else, just nice almost fruity hops, bouqet is a good word for it. Flavour is a bit abrasive with the hop bitterness, on top of not much of a malt body and nothing even remotely like a wheat beer of any kind. Why even bother calling it a wheat ale, other than the gimmicky name? Drinks a lot like Crazy Canuck, Ill just leave it at that....Anyways its still a decent beer, but kind of over-priced and I just feel like if you wanted to make an interesting and hoppy wheat beer, why not make an actual hoppy wheat beer with hops and weiss characters instead of what this is, essentially a pale ale. Given that its so similar to Crazy Canuck, it just seems stupid to offer something at such a higher price, especially from one of the best OCB members I would expect better.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

1539,"2011-03-14",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2011 In short: American wheat beer meets Czech bohemian pilsner.  Superb session beer
How: Bottle 650ml.  Exact age unknown but consumed the very same day I received it from HogtownHarry.  Thanks a lot Harry.
The look: Partly cloudy blonde body topped by a dense large white head with very good retention.  This beer looks awesome
In long: Nose is bright and crisp with grassy spicy notes.  Taste is crisp dry wheat reminiscent of Shredded Wheat cereals, a lot of Saaz-like dry spicy yellowed grass, some minerals, some minty bubblegum, some lemon peels.  Body feels really full for a below 5% brew.  Super crisp, a bit citric, light bitterness, very dry, highly refreshing,  This is probably the best Ontario bottle of beer Ive ever had.  Im concerned about what other people might think if I wonder what will happen if I tell people that I really love an Ontario beer or tell the jury where I have buried the body.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1539,"2010-08-10",3.5,"On tap at Chancey Smiths- Many samples. Deep hazed yellow, pours a frothy and rocky cap that has super sticky qualities. Instant nose of Amarillo hops, pine, lemon drop, grapefruit. Very bitter and hoppy. Again, big on the Amarillo in the flavour. Pine and resniy hop goodness meet citrus fruit and some clove like spice. Long bitter finish. Refreshing and quenching summer brew!","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
1539,"2010-07-31",3.3,"Draught @ The Only, Toronto, ON: Light copper colour, great marshmallow white head. Aroma is metallic, sour orange and rye bread. Tastes nicely bitter with sharp black pepper and tangerine. Sadly, theres a bit of a metallic character to it thats a bit off-putting, but this is still one of the better efforts by this brewery.","Bolton, Ontario, CANADA","Slacks"
1539,"2010-07-25",3.5,"Sampled at the Cest What spring festival 28/05/10. Pours a light amber with decent white head. Aroma boasts fairly piney hops. A decent malting is evident. Hoppy taste with some good malt to back it up. Its a little thin but perhaps thats unfair considering I had it after the imperial heffe by the same brewer. Good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","manuchampions"
1539,"2010-07-10",3.6,"650 ml (Project X) bottle from brewery.  Pours a hazy orange gold with puffy white head.  Nice aroma of citrus, pineapple, light banana and mild grains.  Flavour is strongly citric hoppy (fairly acidic in fact) with some pepperiness.  Lasting, dry bitterness in finish.  Quite good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Spab"

1539,"2010-06-21",3.8,"Draught, at CEst What Spring Festival, May 29, 2010.  Very bubbly and hazy light gold with a solid lasting straw-coloured head.  The aroma is very, very grassy-bitter - my notes go on about it smelling awesome but nothing like a weissbier - too hoppy, hardly fruity at all, some alcohol coming through the spicy grassiness (even asked the bartender if it were the right beer) - later someone pointed out that its inspired by TF Gumballhead - ah ha!  Anyway, tastes really grassy/spicy, hardly any alcohol on the tongue, just a light bit of fruit - it seemed like a saison amped up with a ton of czech pils hops, really fresh - dug it.  Solid body on it too, really lively, a bit acidic (from the hops, I would assume), with a long dry bitter finish - not overly aggressive, but it sticks around a long time.  Well done.  (I hear they are bottling this - I will be buying some)","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
1539,"2010-06-03",3.4,"Special Project X bomber. Clear off-gold with abundant white puffy head. Aromas citrus and a bit of grass. Taste is pretty hoppy with grapefruit rind and lemon and a light green herbal character, and under this a light feel. Some ganga-like character, possibly Simcoe? Amarillo and Centennial. Lacking a bit of fruit and body (GL beers seem to go lean or heavy on malts.) Overall? Surprised this is not sweeter, like a Hefe (given the name) but thats OK.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

1539,"2010-05-24",3.8,"Bottle. Crisp filtered-looking gold with porous firm head that leaves a large amount of lacing. Some yeast in the bottom of the bottle for a bit of a cloudy finish. Sharp hop flavour and peppery flavour make this a different but tasty wheat. Not your norma wheat beer but enjoyable nonetheless.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
1539,"2010-04-21",3.4,"Bottle: Im told this is bottle conditioned but I assume this is cask brew finished in the bottle rather than the a cask. 

Pours a cloudy golden ale in the flute with a solid puffy cap...great lacing. Nice soft natural carbonation.

Aroma is unique for a Weizen this has a pungent bouquet of fruity esters mingled with PNW hops; exotic fruits-banana-citrus...light biscuit aroma.

Soft mouth feel... biscuity, citrus resinous hopping, dry citrusy finish. Bright flavors but not the fruit basket the aroma promised...lacking spice phenols.

I got a couple of these and I suspect as a bottle conditioned weiss it may take a couple more weeks to have all the flavors develop. Ill sample it again.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
1539,"2010-04-17",4.0,"Cask at the brewery - poured a cloudy greenish gold with a firm, small white head.  Lovely aromas of mango, banana, peach, and a whack of citrus.  Some yeast as well.  Flavour much the same, but with a pronounced bitterness at the back end.  Very flavourful for a 4.5% beer.  Kudos to Great Lakes (who just keep getting better and better) or this beer - I hope they brew it again, and on a more consistent basis.  My favourite in the GLB stable.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"

2010-04-01. Lightly hazy golden body with a small white head. Mild aroma, fruity and lightly yeast with some grassy hops. 6+ Flavour is similarly fruity, lightly floral with a modest grassy bitterness throughout. Average palate. At the time I was thinking it was not really to style for a hefe, but as a hoppy wheat ale that seems to fit it more.
