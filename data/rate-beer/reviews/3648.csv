3648,"2016-08-03",4.2,"Piwo leżakowane przez 6 miesięcy w dokładnie wcześniej wyselekcojonowanych dębowych beczkach po 18-letniej Single Malt Whisky z destylarni Highland Park.  
 Kolor: Black Engine Oil - jak najbardziej trafne określenie w tym przypadku. Trunek czarny jak gęsty olej silnikowy. 
 Piana: Beżowo-kremowa, bardzo ładna, wysoka. Wyśmienicie barwi ścianki szkła, pozostawiając na nich masę wstążek.
Pokaźny krążek wisi wysoko nad piwem.
Po zakręcieniu szkłem piana otacza całą jego powierzchnię. 
 Zapach:  Arcyprzyjemny aromat! Nie mogłem wprost nosa oderwać od butelki.
Zapach jest złożony i bardzo wyraźny. 
Wysoko nad butelką unosi się woń szlachetnego alkoholu. Nikt nie ma najmniejszych wątpliwości z jakim alkoholem mamy tutaj do czynienia. Intensywna słodycz ciemnych owoców, toffi, ciemnych winogron. Dalej delikatne migdały, karmel i może szczypta wanilii.
W tle wyraźna torfowa nutka. 
Jestem ukontentowany w 100%-ach! 
 Smak:  W smaku pierwszymi nutami, które mnie zainteresowały były nuty wędzonej śliwki. Dopiero po chwili dołączyła do nich słodycz winogron, rodzynek, toffi i karmelu.
Akcenty dębowej beczki raz po raz dają o sobie znać dając posmaki drewna, dębiny i orzechów migdałowych.
Niezwykle intensywana jest także wędzona, a dalej za nią i torfowa strona piwa.
Goryczka jest dość widoczna z wyrażnym wędzonym posmakiem na ostatniej prostej.
Małe zastrzeżenie mam do tekstury piwa. Nie jest ona należycie gęsta, taka jakiej bym się spodziewał. 
Alkohol natomiast jest pięknie wpleciony w środek. Nie dominuje, jest dobrze ułożony i fajnie pobudza.
Bardzo dobry, degustacyjny trunek. Jedno z najlepszych Old Ale na świecie. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Opakowanie:  Jedno z najładniejszych opakowań. Od razu z daleka produkt wydaje się ekskluzywny, z wyższej półki. Ładna, wyraźna kolorystyka. Sreberko i doczepiona karteczka z dodatkowymi informacjami o poszczególnych Single Maltach, jak i o samym piwie.
Pod spodem - kapselek firmowy do kolekcji (miłe zaskoczenie, bo spodziewałem się golasa). 
 Podsumowanie:  

Ola Dubh (lub ""Balck Oil"" - ""Czarny Olej"") jest piwem, którego nazwa wywodzi się właśnie z jego tekstury i lepkości. O dziwo, w tej właśnie jednej kwestii miałem jedynie tutaj zastrzeżenie. Nie twierdzę, że piwo jest wodnistę, ale skoro nazwa jest taka jak jest, to spodziewałem się gęstości jak w topowych RIS-ach.

Cała reszta jak najbardziej przypadła mi do gustu. Aromat jest przepiękny, intensywny, złożony. Ma wiele do zaoferowania: od ciemnych owoców, toffi, migdałów, winogron, przez nuty karmelu i wanilii, a na torfowych niuansach skończywszy.
Do smaku należy dorzucić rodzynki i przede wszystkim intensywnie wyczuwalne śliwki.
Posmaki szlachetnego alkoholu - Single Malt Whisky badzo dobrze komponują się z całością.

Very fine if any carbonation barely slices through the somewhat sticky but lightish body. IDK I dont think its much different (or better for that matter) than the 12 YO version. What I am certain of is that I seem to have overrated the 16 YO (gave it a whopping 4.2), or alternatively, that was just so much better, which I kinda suspect is not the case as I had that 2 years ago when I hadnt had many BA brews... That said, I really dont think this one (or the 12) is bad - not at all! Its well balanced, without aggressive or ballsy or plain stupid edginess, its round and well drinkable with the whisky rather in the background (as opposed to the massive boozefests of some of the more modern and cool breweries BA brews). But overall TBH Im still a bit disappointed.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"

3648,"2015-06-15",4.2,"0.33 bottle. Insanely dark brown color, (recognizable from black due to light diffraction on the edges), and a medium, brownish head. Strong aroma of roast, dark malts, chocolate, wood, and a sting of whiskey. Taste is very malty, fantastically smoky, prominently chocolaty, and wonderfully balanced. Medium to full body, veritably thick texture, and flat carbonation. Finish is a tad fruitier but also more whiskey-induced. Overall a splendid beer, inherently smacking of high quality whiskey but at the same time at no point is it alcoholic or irritating; certainly worthy of a wholehearted recommendation.","Århus, DENMARK","KoNrRiI"

3648,"2015-04-18",4.0,"Pitch black-body with a tiny, short-lived, medium brown head that disappears almost completely, but the viscous-looking pour and the lovely colour saves the Appearance. Extraordinarily inviting, sweet, malty and very strong aroma of massive chocolate: dark chocolate, bitter chocolate and chocolate sauce. The beer doesnt try to hide the fact that it has been aged in whisky barrels: I get lots of lovely notes of gentle whisky, without much peat. Also vanilla, and an overall vinous feel, even with some hints of port. Finally I pick up notes that remind me of lactic sugar, in a milk stout way? Strong flavour of chocolate, dark caramel, gentle whisky, dark dried fruits and a bit too much alcohol. In the back the sweet vanilla further increases the complexity of this brew. The taste is moderate sweet and moderate bitter. The mouthfeel is actually a bit of a letdown, it beer feels far thinner than it looks, and the texture is less oily than expected. In lack of a better word Id call it a bit watery... The finish is light dry, and the carbonation is soft. A brilliant beer with an amazing aroma and wonderful flavour, but a bit too alcoholic for such a ""low"" ABV beer, and I would have wanted a fuller body and a thicker and more oily texture.

3648,"2014-08-04",3.8,"Poured from a 2012 vintage 330 mL bottle courtesy of Gunnar. Aroma is moderately roasty with some light chocolate notes. Quite a bit of cask character with some medium light oak character and moderate peat notes. Some fruit notes of raisins and prunes. Aroma definitely highlights the cask whiskey character. Pours a motor oil black with a small, moderately thick, light mocha head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges where it linger a bit. Almost no lacing with moderately long legs. Flavor is slightly sweet with a moderate roast and light chocolate character. Some medium light dark fruit notes of prune, plum and raisin with hints of berry and cherry. Again, quite a bit of cask character that adds a bit of sweetness. Moderate whiskey and peat smoke notes. Medium bitterness without any hop flavors. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied and rather silky with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, an interesting stout that really allows you to understand the aroma and flavor of the spirits that the beer was aged in. The whiskey character is not overpowering, but definitely the highlight of the beer. The base beer is not as thick as I was expecting but its aroma and flavor contribute character while still allowing the whiskey notes to shine in an inoffensive way.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Big oak note. Chocolate. A little roastiness. 
Appearance is brown pour with little head. Viscus.

Taste is very smooth. Huge oak note. Whiskey comes through a lot. (I have gotten into whiskey now after all these barrel aged beers... just one more thing to spend my money on.... thanks Obama). A little light really. Probably too old. I mean... 5 years... thats a long time. 

Watery on the palate. But very smooth. Probably because its too old.

3648,"2013-05-26",4.5,"Appearance:
Dark and smoky  liquid charcoal and burnt wood. A thin head fades quickly, leaving behind a tight crema hued collar with a thin free-floating puddle also crema hued. Swirls with tan spots.

Nose:
Meaty dark fruits in the middle  figs and prunes. Chocolate dust, espresso crema, and dark caramel nougat along the edges. Oily tobacco leaf on top. Chestnuts roasting over an open fire then dipped in dark chocolate before eating. Black root and vanilla root weave in and out. Subtle smoke and bacon fat, campfire smoke and leather.

Palate:
Medium weight and super soft front to middle while the back is dry, parching, and thirst inducing. Sweet meaty smoke with bacon and leather oil. Hint of salt/brine in the very back of swallow. Spicy ABV heat. Tar sneaks in and out. Plums and cherries in the breath. Fine chocolate truffle powder and fudge along the edges.

Final Thoughts:
An exquisite beer to say the least. Dark, decadent, smooth, soothing, warming, and dare I say, Islay inspired. Whether intentional or not, the salt/bring essence was a particularly nice touch. The Ola Dubh series from Harviestoun is liquid bliss and well worth the greenbacks spent to enjoy them, the 18 year included.

3648,"2013-02-27",4.2,"330ml bottle. Pours an opaque black, with a smallish beige head, which lasts fairly well and leaves reasonable lacing. Scotch whisky characteristics are very pronounced in the aroma, with plenty of subtle smoke and nutty sweetness, as well as a powerful maritime aroma. Sweet, dark malt aromas are also noticeable, bringing in some toffee and praline notes. Faint herbal and citrus hops up front lead into a savoury, smoky flavour, with a touch of maritime tang coming into the mix. A smooth praline flavour gives it some body, with a nutty flavour and more smoke leading in to a warming finish. I am quite a fan of whisky cask matured ale, and this one is a fine example indeed. The sweeter, mellow characteristics of mature Scotch whisky blend very nicely with a dark, sweet ale to create a very fine brew.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

(33 cl bottle from Vinlageret Fanø; Bottle #11408; Bottled in July 2011) Pours black with medium, toffee head. Impressive lacework. Aroma is whisky with notes of peat and a hint of roasted malt. Oily mouthfeel, soft carbonation, medium to full body and a lingering, roasted finish. Wheat is tangibly present from the occasional ascorbic note and the relatively fluid mouthfeel. Flavour follows the nose. It is impressive how well the alcohol is integrated in this brew without having to sugarcoat it. I guess the aging has rounded it off well. Overall I find this to be a more delicate and peaty whisky ale than the Sort Mælk, which I tried before it. Id say this one gets slightly more out of its ABV than that other one, though.

T: Slight roasted malts up front, with mild chocolate, but the oak and scotch flavors come through the most.

This serves more as an example of what scotch barrel aging can do for a beer than a good beer in its own right.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The head falls loosely. The aroma is sweet syrup malt, a very faint hint of soy and a nicely gentle waft of the whisky and the wood. As it warms, a smoke is evident that helps to balance the initial sweetness.  The taste has more of the Whisky notes - smoke and peat are up front, turning too the soy sweet syrup of the nose, fading back to the wood and smoke and the loose finish.  The integration of flavors is well done, though some of that is lost in the finish. The palate is medium to heavy bodied, low (almost still) carbonation and the finish which sort of breaks down into sweet, smoke and booze. Tasty stuff, thanks Mike.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed more than one year after bottling date.

Taste of creamy chocolate fudge, rich caramel, whisky barrels, peat, tar, vanilla, hazelnuts, crème de menthe (Im not kidding).  Carbonation is very soft.  The beer is obviously quite sweet but somehow it didnt bother me, something bout its minty character prevented it from being cloying.

3648,"2011-01-14",3.8,"Bottle #16096, brewed January 2009. 33 cL from the LCBO courtesy of Rob and Pat, served in a snifter. Pours black with a small light brown head. The head fades slowly to a bare cover but leaves a small amount of fine lace. On the nose, there are aromas of molasses, whisky, and chocolate with hints of espresso, herbs and cask wood. The flavour is moderately sweet with complex notes of whisky, roasted malts, molasses, and espresso. The flavour is balanced with a good dose of herbal hops. The finish is long, lingering whisky with just a touch of hops. On the palate, it is full in body with a milky texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice roasty ale with a strong whisky accent in the latter half. The whisky is more prominent than in the 12 or 18 year old.

Silky chocolate aroma with a touch of smokey malt, vanilla, earthy oak, bourbon, toffee and lactic cream. There is a perfect amount of barrel presence in the nose providing earthy oak, subtle vanilla and coconut balancing out the roasted malt, burnt toast and coffee bean notes.

Slightly chewy medium body with a very prominent whiskey barrel presence that overtakes the roasted dark malt presence. Underneath there is a very faint viscous chocolate malt character with hints of espresso bean, toffee, oatmeal and burnt toast. The complex balance suggested in the nose is missing here with an overwhelming bourbon presence. Very hot and sweet overpowering the subtle vanilla, caramel and toffee notes.

3648,"2010-05-05",4.0,"(Old BA rate - cask)
Similar in appearance to the other vintages of Ola Dubh in that it is damn near black. But it does have the wonderful tinges of brown. Poured with a thinnish, darker tan head. As anticipated, the whiskey and malt aromas shine the most, but there are some earthy aromas as well and a bit of smoke. Like the smell, the whiskey grabs your attention first, but then gives way to smokey and salty flavors. Fairly thin, and not nearly as oily as other Ola Dubh vintages that Ive tried. Little to no bubbliness (cask), but very pleasant. Not as drinkable as either the 40yr or 30yr IMO. The 18yr just didnt carry the nuances and complexities as well as the other two and therefore each sip was not as interesting as the last.

The aroma has notes of rich brown toasted and bready malts, treacle, sea salt, peat, oak, sherry, hint of pure cacao nibs, fig and apricots. Initial taste is rich dark fruits, heavy scotch imbued malts and wood with a very earthy and old school oxidization. Lovely undertones of dark candi sugar, walnut and mineral water completes the experiance. The one thing about this brew that falls short is the mouth feel, far too thin for the flavor profile and far too oaky and tannic. The alcohol warming is noticeable but not intrusive. I liked this but would put it below the 12 and 16 aged barrels and on par with the 30, can not wait to try the last 40 yo soon.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Dark brown with a small off-white head that dont leave a lot of lacings.

The aroma is of sweet whisky, oak, salty licorice and dark malts.

The flavor is sweet and well balanced, but perhaps a little on the simple side. However, it is very well integrated. The coffee and chocolate flavors from the malts go really well with the subtle sweet fruity whisky aromas. Some cookie-like malts appear in the middle. The finish is mildly bitter and has a delicate warmth to it. Ends with notes of oak, whisky and salty licorice. 

Medium body and comparably lots of carbonation. Wouldve loved it if it had a bigger body.

No hint of 8%, I really could glug this. Dryness is the biggest component, but it isnt past the level where one more sip satisfies more than it dries.

Lots of roasty coffee, overpowering the molasses, chocolate and vanilla malts, but still striking a good balance of flavors. It ended up a little dilute, though admittedly I was expecting more of a big stout.

Pours with a medium brown head over a black body. Head seems to stay longer than other Ola Dubhs. Can smell the chocolate wafting out of my glass from a far. Closer inspection yields dark fruits and fudge, with wet wood, very light peat and Scotch notes.

Although this is good, with fudge up front, followed by toffee, dark fruits and a nice round scotch flavor that trails off to a peat stone like minerally finish. Low residual sugars, but not nearly as low as the 40. Some firewood smoke too. Can taste that this is an Island/Highland Scotch and not a Speyside. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, not silky, but full.
