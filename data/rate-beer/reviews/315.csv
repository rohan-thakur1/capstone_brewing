315,"2016-07-19",4.4,"Kuhnhenn 4th D - unfortunately I have no idea which vintage this is, due to a missing vintage label: stored it in the fridge for about a year.

Pours a dark brown color with a quickly disappearing khaki brown head.

Smells of unsweetened coconut shell, earth and scented wood, enriched by dried grapes and old oak. Offers a nice Bourbon spiciness which gets entangled into toasted nuts and grilled corn. Surprisingly earthy, focussing on the barrel without turning just a tad too sweet, creating a spicy, warm complexity on the nose which is awesome. 

Drinks truly soft, establishing a great silkness, which unfolds the Bourbon in all its powerfull facets. Its hot bite gets balanced by the rich toasty malt base, creating a powerful, complex beer.

Tastes of sugar glazed malts, a hint of licorice, dusty woodbark and toasty, bready malts. Spicy, sweet cinnamon and bakers chocolate add to the malt backbone, while a warming Boubon sharpness slowly becomes more and more recognizable. Ends sweet with a well integrated booziness, showcasing even more tongue tickling spices and toasty toffee malts. Finished very clean and soft, with a heavy Bourbon appearance defining the taste.

Masterfully balanced, intense beer, reminding of a Barley Wine at first glance, which from there on transforms into something different. All flavors work very harmoniously together, exhibiting a slowly uprising Bourbon sweetness which reveals a respectable amount of earth and bread. At its peak sweet toffee and scented wood add to the taste, never forgetting its rustic, bready roots. Finishes utmost clean after revealing its breathtaking complexity, calm after unleashing an intense flavor storm on the palate. Despite its taste intensity the beer drinks incredibly soft and almost easy if it wasnt for the perfectly integrated Bourbon, which works so good with the beers profound malt foundation.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Dried fruits: figs, grapes, sweet cherries. Finish is a nice hop kick with the booze creeping up at the end. Booze warmth, but nowhere near as agressive as the ABV would suggest. Dried fruits linger in the mouth for minutes after drinking. Overall, an extremely well-balanced barleywine, old ale or whatever you like to call it.

Heavy complex aromas of marshmallow, vanilla, bourbon and caramel. The flavor is similar. A little more booziness than is detected in the nose, but the mouth feel is perfect. Just thick enough and the flavors last greatly.

315,"2013-10-05",4.0,"Had on-tap at the Kuhnhenn Brewery on a paddle.

Appearance: Pretty nice. About a finger of a tan head and surprisingly decent lacing. The beer is a dark brown color with red when held to light. Looks better than I expected... I thought it may look flat.

Smell: Compared to the standard 4D (11), this had a lot of caramel. There was also quite a lot of darker fruits there as well. The vanilla notes that youd expect from barrel aging werent really there all that much. A very nice smelling beer all the same.

Taste: Having side-by-side with the regular 4D, this was definitely a bit more mellow, as one would expect given the barrel. Its not a huge difference, but its noticeable. The mouth feel is maybe a bit thicker. The taste itself on this one just isnt on par with the regular 4D... of course, thats just my humble opinion. The BB4D mellows out the fruity notes quite considerably and replaces them with a maltier, sweeter flavor. Its still excellent, but not quite as tasty.

Im extremely happy to have gotten the chance to try this beer. I dont think its as legendary as some people said it would be (like I said, I preferred the standard 11 4D), but I liked it. Recommended.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"
315,"2013-10-01",4.7,"2012 Vintage poured at 50 degrees into a FSW barrelworks tulip. 

A- Pours a viscous brown color with ruby hues when held to the light. A 1/2 inch beige head forms and quickly fades to a thick ring around the rim of the glass. Carbonation bubbles are apparent throughout. 

S- Bourbon. Vanilla. Alcohol. Some oak. A little bit of caramel and malty sweetness, but I cant tell if it is coming from the barrel or the base beer. Either way, this smells fantastic and very inviting. Only drawback is there is not a ton of complexity.

T- Up front, a really nice malty caramel sweetness along with some molasses and port-like cherry esters. On the back end, there is a huge blast of vanilla, bourbon, and some oak tannins along with a touch of bitterness to round things out. There is alcohol present, but no fusel or hot flavor. Spot on for the style. Wow- this is an amazing beer!

M- Luscious. Smooth, low carbonation that gives the beer a creamy feel. High body, although not overly sweet. Great balance between the tannic oak and high finishing gravity make this a smooth drinker. 

O- I was not expecting this beer to be so amazing. I want to rate this badly in a disguised attempt to trade for more of it, but it deserves better than that. Great winter time sipper that meshes bourbon and malt perfectly, without being an over the top, diabetic coma inducing sort of beer. Gimme more.","","justforrazors"

Decent amount of acidity in here to balance things out, which is pretty important for a potential sugar bomb like this. Pretty full mouthfeel with a finish of chocolate and alcohol heat.

315,"2013-06-04",3.5,"Dark brown coloured body with some nice violet coloured highlights and no head at all to speak of. Aroma of oak, vanilla, whiskey, scotch and a bit of earth - but the differences of the normal beer are massive. Very full-bodied; Viscous feel with a ton of alcohol and whiskey flavours with too much depth, and almost a scotch-like drink, not many beer-like flavours at all. Aftertaste is complex, but focused solely around whiskey, oak, bourbon and alcohol - this has the warmth of scotch and seemingly as much alcohol! Overall, a solid beer - but too much whiskey/scotch aging - this tastes like a spirit and not like a beer. Nice if thats what you like, but if you do, you should probably be avoiding beer.

Intense aroma of burnt brown sugar, chocolate, bourbon soaked raisins, molasses and slight alcohol, but the alcohol aroma is favorable. It seems to add to the aroma.  Sweet taste matches aroma and is superbly balanced. Reminds me of a thick and creamy super smooth port wine, but with no alcohol burn. No one flavor is over powering. Mouthfeel is super thick and creamy. Even though alcohol is present, it adds to this beer and is well hidden for 13.5%. One of the very best beers I have ever had and I have had some good ones.

315,"2013-03-26",4.4,"0.355l bottle. Where did I get this bottle really? Im almost certain that it was somewhere in London. Cask Pub & Co perhaps? Note to self: have to find out where I got this puppy. Anyhow, its a mysterious almost murky brown looking thing this, and I immediately noticed that it has no head what so ever. The nose however is really present, and I just have to say YES! It smells fantastic... Lovely sweet and licorice-like with that barrel influence that only the magnificent bourbon manage to produce. A little bit of friendly-dog aroma swooshes into my nose next to both ripe black and blue berries, grandma-caramel and fresh produced tarmac. Totally serious, there is not much to subtract on this amazing aroma. Guess its time to taste it: Im surprised to find out that it actually has some carbonation left in it. If the pour should indicate the carbonation level I would have guessed that it was totally flat, but there is definitely a nice prickling feeling on this one. And the taste? Yeah, its really nice as well, and sweet? Yeah, really barley-sweet all the way! It has most definitely been on wood this one! Its sticky, caramelly and sweet, yet it has a vanilla and woody flavor combined with a salty licorice, almost Maldon-salty sensation, and sweet raisins! Lots of them in this. Oh, my. These flavors exceeded what I thought I was expecting. Could be the fact that I probably have had a bit to much to drink now, but is one of those flavor-bombs everyone deserves to taste at some point, and I honestly believe at least 35 people could enjoy this little bottle. Thats how much flavor this little thing contains. Lovely! 07.12.2012","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

A - Pours a nearly opaque dark, dark brown body that is just a shade below black. Holding this up to the light creates a sheen of dark red illumination through the beer. One finger of light khaki foam forms but doesnt stick around long. A swirl generates a long lasting lace of tiny bubbles that falls down slowly leaving behind some alcohol legs. 

S - As soon as I cracked the bottle I got a huge whiff of bourbon and oak. The nose is strong on the dark fruits and vanilla. Dates, raisins, and mincemeat. A warming blast of alcohol followed by smooth and rich caramel, brown sugar, toffee, and marsh mallow. Spicy and woody with a lingering ethanol presence. The aroma does not hide its alcohol, instead it puts it on full display like a fine high proof bourbon.

T - Caramel, marshmallow, molasses, brown sugar, maple, raisins and some chocolate. Smooth and earthy english toffee with a smooth oak and vanilla finish. A very complex drinker with a plethora of sweet and decadent flavors attacking your tongue. The alcohol has a pleasing burn on the end.

M - Medium bodied and slick, well carbonated. Probably not for those who dont enjoy boozy beers.

315,"2012-11-14",3.1,"2011 bottle to Double Bastard glass.  Totally flat, no carbonation.  Chalky dark leather brown pour.  From a distance I detected a slightly sour aroma which concerned me.  Up close, however, is oak, molasses, bourbon, and a touch of smoke.  Flavor is sweet bread, bourbon, maple syrup, licorice, cola, and wood.  Oxidation is starting to creep in.  The lack of carbonation definitely hurts the mouthfeel.  This one is past its prime which is too bad given my anticipation for it.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"

315,"2012-11-04",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2013  It pours a dark brown, more or less black with a fizzy and small light tan head. It quickly fizzes away with just a few specks of lacing. Kind of expected at this abv, but yet some brewers manage to produce beers with decent heads at this abv. The smell is good. There is a noticeable old ale base. The bourbon and oak arent overpowering but still highly noticeable. There is a huge amount of dark fruits and a hint of soy. The taste is rich with bourbon and dark fruits. Really deep dark fruit notes. The bourbon adds a bit of alcohol, vanilla, and caramel. It isnt too alcoholic in the taste though, not too hot. It warms the tummy for sure though. It feels like you are drinking a liqueur rather than a beer taste-wise. This is a beer that combines the best aspects of an old ale with some really good barrel notes. I would recommend tracking down a bottle. 7/4/8/4/19

In your face alcohol bite with more sweet caramel syrup and burnt sugar flavor. An insane sipper really. Carbonation is soft but feels more than that because of the alcohol tickling the tongue.

A: Pours a dark brown with plum edges. A one finger head of tan foam forms on the pour and quickly dissipates to some wisps and a thin collar. Splotchy, soapy lace is left down the glass with some light sticky residue as well.

S: Wow, there is a ridiculous amount of deliciousness going on in the nose. Sweet bourbon, light oak, slightly charred marshmallow, dark prune fruits, grainy malts and a little touch of alcohol the back end.

T: Sweet bourbon is up front with some woody oak mixing in as well. Heavily toasted marshmallow, semi wet leather, roasted oats and some tobacco leaves. Light bitter dark fruits. The finish has a slight alcohol flavor with a touch of heat.

M: Heavy bodied with low carbonation. The finish is smooth with some minimal heat with a nice sweetness.

O: I didnt think the regular 4D could get any better. Oopsie! Barrel aging that bad boy just enhanced everything I loved about the regular 4D and just added new layers of complexity. I couldnt be more happy

The taste is a tour de force of sweet malts and alcohol with a classic English barley wine overtone. Very earthy, very boozy, and still shows some bitterness (more like coffee than hops) with some biting spicy undertones too.  Hint of bakers chocolate, sea salt and pralines.

315,"2012-03-01",4.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/12/2011.  Served on tap at Kuhnhenn in a tulip. 

Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia is bistre in color with walnut edges. A small off-white head starts firm, then fades to mostly a ring. Not much lace, but the head reaffirms itself with each sip or swirl. Not a ton of lace expected here with such a big ABV.

Great aroma, there is no doubt about it. Tons of molasses, plums, raisins, fig, caramel, and dark roasted malts. Bourbon and oak just add another level of complexity, although each aroma is easily identifiable in its own right.

Once I smelled this, I figured the taste would be incredible, and it does not disappoint. Just tons of flavor throughout each sip. The bourbon barrel aging interacts perfectly with the original beer. Very complex. Caramel malt is the first flavor to be noticed, and then an bourbon burning that is present throughout. Sweet molasses and roasted malt, figs, and plums provide the sweetness. Light earthy hops, then oak, smoke, and a touch of bourbon to finish. Very satisfying.

The creaminess is immediately noticeable, with the body of the beer quashing the carbonation. Alcohol warms the throat and stomach throughout, and the lips are left a little bit sticky. A very full body.

Barrel aging claims another victory. It just made a great beer even better. Obviously a sipper, but I would be satisfied sipping this for a long time.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

That toffee comes right out of the aroma and onto your tongue. Everything except the cheese, actually, translates directly from the aroma into the flavour.

315,"2012-02-19",3.8,"2010 courtesy of Scott. Appearance is extremely dark brown, good legs, minimal amount of lacing. Not an attractive beer.

Really heavy on the caramel and honey in a good way. The sweetness and the bitterness work well together. However, this is still pretty hot even after nearly 2 years, and it detracts from the experience. Palate is smooth and velvety. Theres enough carbonation in the body to keep this one lively.

315,"2011-12-16",4.2,"12oz bottle picked up at the brewpub, 2010 Vintage. Pours a deep brown colored body with a touch of ruby around the edges. Thin, brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing throughout. Aroma jumps out of the bottle immediately upon opening and it is damn good. Tons of rich toffees and dark fruits consisting of dates, raisins, plums, and some vinous fruits. A nice bourbon and vanilla with some barrel behind the big malts. Some slightly sticky brown sugar, molasses, caramel, a touch of toast, and light cocoas. A light warming alcohol in the nose. Flavor is similar. Big and rich, slightly sticky and warm toffees, caramel, and brown sugar up front with lots of dark fruits. Plenty of raisins with some vinous fruits and more molasses. A few wood tannins with a nice bourbon and vanilla in the middle as the alcohol becomes noticeable, but not distracting. Toast and cocoa really come on nicely towards the end as this finishes with some booze and an alcohol warmth while staying sweet, oaky, and slightly spicy with lots of dark fruits.

315,"2011-11-28",3.8,"12 oz. bottle, 2010 vintage aged about a year I would guess.  The pour yields a dark and lightly hazy reddish chestnut colored body with a thin, swirly, khaki colored film.  A dense wash of spots slowly rejoins the body, forming a bubbly ring at the edge of the surface.  The nose is ultra rich and decadent, showing loads of stewed dark raisins, figs, dates, and blackened caramel.  Hints of cocoa, cola, and sorghum all ring through, as do surprisingly potent citrus and earthen hops.  An oaky, bourbony, boozy shroud envelops everything, fighting for top billing rather than assuaging the other elements.  Flavors are similarly structured, bordering on exceedingly woody and warm with alcohol, loaded with rich, dark caramel and buttery toffee.  Underlying fruits arent as well defined as they are on the nose.  They are seemingly more centered on scorched dates and other muddled, stewed dark fruits.  The juicy, citrusy, bitter hoppiness is quite intense, though, which is actually welcomed here.  It resembles a black barley wine in a number of ways, which I suppose is the closest cousin to the old ale (though notedly more hoppy).  The palate is nearly full, and it would be decidedly too syrupy if it werent for the lively, intense carbonation.  oozy heat comes with the territory, I suppose, but it is certainly more intense than I care for (and Im a whiskey head).  All in all, its a solid, decadent slow sipper for a cold night, but I prefer the virgin 4th Dementia to the barrel aged version.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
315,"2011-11-21",3.2,"In short: A extremely sweet, extremely boozy and very bourbonny syrupy sipper.  It is what it is
How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed when approximately 1 year of age I think.  Bottle sent to me by WeisGuy, thanks a lot Shane
The look: Cloudy dirty burgundy body with no head
In long: Nose is an attack of brutal boozy bourbon over sweet rich toffee.  This beer smells like a alcoholised dessert where the pastry chef went overboard with the alcohol.  Thick syrupy sticky body, low carbonation, sweetest toffee ever, more brown sugar, a lot of booze, oaky vanilla, light notes of rasisins.  Alcohol is very apparent and each percent of the 13.5% is showing if not more.  Finish is alcohol burn and a woody astringency that helps make this monster a bit more drinkable.  Not a very good beer but despite my complaints this is an acceptable brutal beer, a winter-warmer that you can sip slowly.  With all the progress of the past 20 years, big boozy sugary brutal beers is the new evolution of the American craftbeer?!?!?  But thats not surprising coming from a nation that has put in orbit a sophisticated array of satellites and now mostly uses it to locate the nearest Burger King.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
315,"2011-11-21",4.4,"12oz bottle, 2010. Dark dark brown pour with a ruby hue, minimal tan head that disappears almost instantly.

Low carbonation, full body, prickly on the palate from the booze (still a little hot), sweet, lots of bourbon, vanilla, oak. Finish continues sweet, long lasting great combination of vanilla, toffee, bourbon, malt, and wood. This definitely reminds me of BCS because its one of the best bourbon aged beers I have had - not overwhelming (although this bottle was a little hot - think it could do with sitting a while longer) - yet lets the bourbon barrel process shine.

315,"2011-09-11",4.2,"12 oz bottle Ive been sitting on from Deyholla for a good while. Thanks, Derek! #2600, the game rolls on. Pours a darker brown hue, good murky haze with some glow to the edges, some ruby red hues start to peek around with a small frothy offwhite head that turns to a tiny ring, minimal lacing. Aromas are rich, sweet toffee and dark fruit, vanilla, figs, wet oak, vanilla, some spirit, oxidized malts, cocoa, touches of coffee, molasses, caramel, toast, biscuits. More vinous fruit, plums, with touches of spicy, mellow deep warming sweetness. Nothing hot to the nose at all. A rich complex malt and barrel play. Initial is full bodied, a touch of warmth up front throws toffee and dark fruit, wet oak, vanilla, and touches of spice, brown sugar, cocoa. Mellow deep dark sweetness, with more caramel and toffee, some port notes, wet oak and old deep Bourbon, not hot but flavorful. Oxidized malts. Backend throws a touch more dryness, with cocoa and bakers chocolate, toast, dried out malts, bread, some more vanilla clinging on, barrel. Oak. Cocoa. Really nice, as the finish leaves some brown sugar, cakey qualities, banana, dark fruit, cocoa, carmelized fruits, barrel, vanilla. Really rich and complex, yet not overbearing, just a touch of ABV heat lingering on. My god, this is pretty amazing. A barreled barleywine with great flavors, complexity, not a one-trick malt pony. The barrel leaves great footprints without making the beer warm and ABV ridden or sweet and malty. Not too thick, but a good enough body to play out on the palate. Lots of elements to pick out, wouldnt have guessed it to be a 13.5% beer, though I can detect some strength obviously. Really really great beer here. Barreled pretty much perfectly. Thanks again, Derek. Wish I had one more.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

It is drinking great right now, and while I am not usually an advocate of putting a lot of age on a BA beer, I have 1 more of these that I think I am going to save for another year or 2. I dont think the Bourbon flavor will fade to a point that it will loose that special quality overtime as is the case with some BA beers.

Smells somewhat similar to creme brulee.  Theres also some coconut and faint soy sauce.  Bit of butterscotch.  Flavor possesses a strong bourbon presence, with plenty of charred oak taking up a significant portion of the flavor when this is cooler, and it definitely interferes with my perception of the malts.  As this warms, the barrel tones down a bit, and I get more flavors of dark fruits, caramel, and some chocolate.  Some oxidation too.  The alcohol is very strong in this and it singes the tongue when drinking.  Mouthfeel is very full and viscous and carbonation is restrained.

315,"2011-06-09",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
Brash brown sugar, madeira and soy whip up an intense caramel of sorts which is neither tight nor all that pleasant to sip. An unrefined sugar explosion.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-There is no head of foam atop the brownish terracotta.
-Light smokiness adds complexity within the murky, sickly sweet body.
-Alcohol burn is actually welcome as it tends to cut through the overwhelming sensation of sweetness.
-The malt profile is poorly defined. Lots of flavors come from the grain bill, but most of them are in the form of residual sugars.
-Fruity edges come from the bourbon barrel.
-Just noticed this is Top 50 material here. Goodness gracious. Not for me, to say the least...

315,"2011-05-21",4.7,"Poured into a snifter. 2010 on the label. I had this on-tap a little while ago and it blew my mind, but I didnt review it since I have pretty well buzzed with a wrecked palate. Heres my chance to spread the good word.

3.0 A: Pours a cloudy dark brown, nearly black color. A fairly aggressive pour gave a maximum head of about 1/4 a finger, which quickly receded. Im sure the ABV didnt help with the head formation, but Ive seen other Kuhnhenn brews form very nice heads despite super high ABVs.

5.0 S: Simply amazing. This is the perfect beer for a bourbon treatment and the bourbon treatment is done perfectly. The bourbon is what hits you first, so I guess Ill talk about that first. Intense, but tranquil bourbon - leather, peppery, raisin, oak and vanilla. Theres also a moderate to not quite heavy booziness that complements the other aromas. The beer underneath is similarly wonderful. Dark fruits in the order of prune, tobacco, raisin, and fig. Sweet caramel and toffee. Perfect amount of sweetness.

5.0 T: Again, absolutely wonderful. Rich caramel and toffee. Sweet prune, plum, raisin, fig, date, tobacco, and raisin. Intense, yet well integrated flavors much like GI BCS. The bourbon again is a perfect complement to the base brew. Plenty of leathery bourbon that has a spicy quality to it with perhaps just a touch of peat. Moderate oakiness with a more than moderate amount of vanilla. Not a hint of tannins. The booziness is definitely detectable, but it doesnt taste like 13.5%. However, it certainly feels like 13.5% as in warms on the finish. Sweet caramel aftertaste.

4.5 M: Thick, creamy, and slightly chewy body. My only issue with this is that the carbonation is just a tad lower than Id prefer. Incredibly smooth given the ABV.

5.0 D: This is one helluva beer. Theres no getting around that. This takes a very good beer and supplements it with bourbon barrel flavors, which makes it a truly world class brew. The base beer is still strong enough to shine while the barrel aging adds everything you would want and nothing you wouldnt.

Its sweet up front and gives way to a nice smooth liquor flavor on the midpalate leading to a mild but clean bitterness at the back, its subtle but there. The whole beer is good.

The aroma is big smooth boldness, how dare it be this bold, with smooth sweet bourbon, rich vanilla, some caramel candy goodness, earthiness, dates and raisins. The barrel-ness overshadows the drool inducing base beer aromatics. The taste begins with a mix of prunes, raisins, dates and caramel, oh yeah! These notes grow toward bourbon and modest notes of vanilla and spicy oak. Yes. This may very well be amazing in a couple of years. A bit barrel forward and just a tough rough right now but thats getting picky.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
315,"2011-02-10",4.9,"Huge thanks to Normyk for this bottle. The regular Fourth Dementia was a long time want of mine, and it was fantastic. I didnt even know they make a BA verson.

Poured into a Jackie Os snifter after a steak and potatoes dinner.
A- This version is a little more muddy looking than its non-barreled counterpart. Its a burnt chestnut brown with cool hues leaning towards purple. No real head at all but I expected this. The thick liquid does give some nice veins streaming down the glass.

S- Woah this smell is phenomenal. After having the regular 4D I didnt think the BA version could be much better, until now. Bourbon is artfully woven into a toffee and cherry tapestry. Parts of this aroma are so rich and sweet that it smells like fresh baked cookies. Alcohol is huge but well rounded and softened by figgy fruits and soft barrel notes.

T- This earns a big fat nickel for the flavor as well. One of the very best tasting beers Ive come across. It is exactly the kind of beer that Im in the mood for. This beer is deep. Toffee, nougat, caramelized fruits, black cherries and some subtle, smooth vanilla. There is a brief spiciness like bowl of bread pudding. This is very much a dessert beer, or should I say, after dinner beer. Its sweet and boozy but elegantly balanced and smooth.

M- Carbonation is nearly flat but it works so well with this beer. It has a slightly sticky body with unabashed alcohol burn.

D- The alcohol warmth prevents one from drinking this fast. This is simply an amazing night cap of a beer.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","MbpBugeye"

315,"2011-01-23",4.1,"12oz bottle 2010 vintage. Dark, thick and oily maroon/brown pour. Short lived head that quickly dissipates. It looks virtually still save for a few bubbles struggling mightily to get to the top. Decadent and rich malt enhanced by plenty of barrel tones on the nose. Toffee, butterscotch, caramel, marzipan, creme brulee, vanilla, bourbon soaked oak, coconut, melted dark chocolate. Spicy alcohol, but does not distract. Flavor isnt quite as sweet as the nose lead me to believe. Moderate sweetness, little to no bitterness. Some English toffee, red wine grapes (?), vanilla, and oak... lots and lots of oak. The wood becomes quite drying on the back sides of the tongue near the finish. Theres a slight saltiness that I cant quite put my finger on; salted peanuts or peanut butter perhaps? An absolute malt and barrel bomb on the tongue for sure. Full bodied with an oily texture that (thankfully) never becomes cloying. Soft carbonation leading to a slightly boozy, but mostly dry (oak, oak oak!) finish. These bourbon bombs usually arent my thing, but this is a fine example for sure.

Pours a murky chestnut brown with a small beige head that recedes to a small collar and leaves no lacing, just some boozy legs clinging to the side.

Aroma is massive and spectacular.  Where to begin - sweet caramel malts, vanilla, coconut, toffee, tobacco, leather and sugar-coated dark fruits.  Let alone the bourbon and oak which integrate into the rest.  Whoa.

Taste is just as impressive with an initial sweetness from coconut, caramel malts and dark fruits - raisins and figs.  There is also an underlying earthy leather character.  The finish is just decadent with toffee, vanilla and a nice bourbon burn with spicy oak thrown in.

The mouthfeel is smooth and dessert-like, thick and sweet with minimal carbonation but plenty for the style.

A - Pours a mirky reddish/brown, half a fingers-worth of off-white head with some larger bubbles here and there on top. After the initial pour, theres no lacing a some random bubbles and a thin film on top.

S - Burnt sugars, candy, bourbon, oak, dark fruits, bourbon, malts and more bourbon. Its not overly sweet and not too boozy. I was very surprised how balanced this one was, especially with very little aging.

315,"2009-08-08",4.7,"Kuhnhenn Brewing is a tiny brewery in Warren, Michigan which brews small batch artisanal ales that you would swear the brewing goddesses above had blessed. Rare, coveted, and possibly even worshiped, their ales encapsulate the time-honored tradition of small batch artisanry which I imagine many of our fore-mothers and fore-fathers of brewing held dear. In little hamlets and villages the world over, a skilled brewer was the pride of the town, and their wares were quite often top-notch, enjoyed and sacredly coveted by knowledgeable outsiders. I would put myself on the coveting side seeing as I have only been able to sup on two of their beers so far. Small bottles big on flavor and character, I can see, smell, and taste the heavens in their beer.


Deep dirty amber brown with a fluffy tan head. As her tan clouds descend upon the murky seas below, lace crackles and sparks along the sides of my glass, striking in playful intervals. With each strike, smoking wood and dank, dark nutrient-rich earth sizzles underneath. Brown spices mingle with apple skins and sun-dried prunes. Cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, sage, and rosemary highlight sweet prunes and the crisp citric acidity of red apple skins. She is very forestry and woody; I feel as if I have stumbled into the Black Forests of Germany centuries past where majesty lingers in the air with a heavy presence. Despite her dampness, there is an underlying presence of dry wood tannins, and I simply cannot take it anymore. Diving headfirst into her body, I am enveloped in an array of tastes and textures; dry, sweet, spiced, rummy, earthy, and woody. Wood tannins immediately work their palate cleansing pleasures atop my tongue while her alcohol warmth permeates my body. Her warmth lingers in each breath with nutmeg and cinnamon sticks while sticky my lips reveal butterscotch and maple. A solid palate, she focuses the brunt of her attack in the middle, choosing to come in with a whisper, conquer, and then leave just the same. Prunes and raisins finish last with a deep chewy sweetness. As we part ways, more warmth, spice, dry wood tannins, and the crisp crunch of red apple skins linger in sweet memoriam.


When I sup on a beer like this, there is clarity of understanding in my heart and in my mind. I understand why, for centuries, brewers were lauded sacred positions in society. Beyond being liquid bread, I imagine that many of their brews were heralded for their taste and flavor; a life-enhancing beverage which was also a gourmand experience of heavenly origins. Vinophiles can have their viticulture. Ill stick to my beer, continuing my sacred quest for the fruits of Kuhnhenn Brewing.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Recieved this gem in a trade with badbeer, thanks again. A hard pour conjures up a minimal swirling of head that disappears rather quickly. Theres a tiny ring of head around the edge of the glass. The small head is expected from such an alcohol bomb such as this. The color on the pour is a muddy brown before becoming opaque dark brown in the glass. 

I dont think this beer could even accomodate another aroma. Big nose filling whiffs of dark rye and pumpernickle bread start things off. All this bready goodness is wrapped around a handful of brown sugar and molasses. This again is all wrapped around a sweet oaken whiff of bourbon. Everything comes together flawlessly. Theres alcohol in there but I can feel the fumes more in my eyes and nose that smell its presence.

Flavor picks up right wherethe smell left off. The swett notes (brown sugar and molasses) are just the right intensity bringing the bready malts into the oak and bourbon perfectly. The breadiness up front is absolutely mouthwatering and just pulls you right in. The bourbon and oak accompany the breadiness without being too dominant. World class old ale!

The mouthfeel is just as perfectly done as the rest of the drink. Sluggish carbonation leaves this beer sliding slowly along your tongue. As it slowly works through every seperate flavor grabs hold at some point or another. The body has some weight to it and coats the mouth nicely.

The alcohol and big bold flavors keeps this a one and done type of beer. The bottle Im drinking now will be a pleasure to finish but thats enough for one sitting.

This is not only a world class olde ale but a world class beer period. The barrel aging sets this beer on an entirely different level. Im glad I could get my hands on one of these. Its a great beer to celebrate Christmas.

315,"2008-01-10",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 Bottle shared by kmweaver. You rock Ken! Dark burgundy purple colored body with a slow forming tan head that sits as a film on top.  Hugely rich bourbon and sherry nose, with plums and wood all over the place.  Rich, chewy, robust plum, roast, and dry wood, warming into the finish with a brandy and sherry flavor, before morphing into more of a pure bourbon character, leaving the tongue tingling with dried dark fruit.  Some meaty soy or jerky marinade is picked up as well, maybe an interpretation of the wood, dark fruit, bourbon and light spices tasted in the 4th Dementia.  Awesome stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
315,"2008-01-09",4.5,"12oz bottle, courtesy of badbeer.  Thanks, Mike!  Pours a very murky, rusty-brown color; khaki-colored head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Beautiful, generous aroma: tons of dried red fruits, chewy caramel, and a touch of viscous bourbon; leather and vanilla; awesome, awesome aroma.  Full mouthfeel: tons of leather, caramel, and warming bourbon; toasty vanilla coming through from the oak, but very controlled and toasty and well-integrated; the alcohol is integrated perfectly, with a warming bourbon and dried dark fruit character; ridiculously good, even if argo0 gives it a 3.8.  Stinky Aaron.  Lengthy, dried dark fruits and doughiness and caramel in the finish.  Honestly, this was incredibly good, well-made from the beginning, and beautifully blended.  Awesome.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
315,"2008-01-09",4.4,"Finally. Generously provided by kmweaver. Thanks Ken! Cloudy brown body with a small beige head. The nose lightly oxidized, tons of caramel and toffee, bourbon, vanilla, some pine and citrus with a hint of roast and vanilla. The favor is moderately sweet and vinous with bourbon, lots of vanilla and oak, berry, light cherry, toffee, brown sugar and prunes. Full body is sticky, soft and a bit oily with light carbonation. Amazing.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"

Shared with hellomynameis and a friend of mine at my house. This was very nice. The barrel aging was clearly present in the aromas, it wasn;t overdone.Still loads of malty goodness and some dark fruit notes. This was good when it wasnt BAed and it still is very tasty.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"
315,"2007-10-13",4.4,"bottle.....aroma: huge wood aged malt bomb.  absolutely tons of oak, bourbon, vanilla, maple upfront.  the second degree gives you a little more of a gentle dark fruit scent.  this one really hit me in the face in a very good way....appearance: very dark brown with no head whatsoever.  little as far as lacing is concerned as well.....taste: maintains the consistency of the nose. oak, bourbon, vanilla, maple. it seems to be very boozy and warms the throat. a little more carbonation when compared to the regular version.  medium to full body but not too thick.....i think i found a new fave!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
315,"2007-09-30",4.2,"Poured a dark brown color with a small off-white head.    The aroma was great.  Notes of aged malt, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits and vinous.  The flavor was a nice blend of bourbon and sweet aged malt.  Dark fruits and vanilla matched the aroma.  Nice chest warmth from the alcohol but cant taste it.  Woody notes with a medium to full body.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
315,"2007-09-25",4.4,"Dark brown with some red showing through, not a huge head but soe exists and is almost a brown sugar colour. Aroma is filled with dark fruit, sweet malts, and come caramel/toffee. The flavour is devine and is very full. Its not sticky or too full. I get some alcoholic heat in the middle for only a fleeting second. Lots of really nice toffee or burnt caramel at the end. Theres a lot going on in this and its really very nice.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

315,"2007-06-29",4.4,"Holy crap.  What a flavorful ale!  Thanks to WeeHeavySD I got to taste this monster of a beer.  Really sweet with a ton of barrel flavor to it.  A sipper indeed, though Id love to crush a few of these back to back and see what it does to my state of mind.  Delicious.  I want more.","La Mesa, California, USA","Bartzilla"
315,"2007-06-28",4.6,"12 oz bottle via trade with hoppymeal, birthday bash bottle 4 shared with Bartzilla on his B-Day.  Aroma is nuts.  Super sweet molasses with a touch of brown sugar.  Pours dark brown with a hin ring of a tan head.  Taste is damn incredible.  The taste is sweet bold with a huge brown sugar molasses sweetness.  This beer is truly amazing and I am honored to have been able to sample its glory.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
315,"2007-06-18",4.7,"Finally am tasting one of my bottles of this.  Beautiful dark brown with some fine bubbles on top.  Aroma of toffee, molasses, vanilla, malted barley, bourbon.  Wow that smells awesome.  This also tastes very awesome: extremely bready, some fruits in the back of the mouth, vanilla.  I agree with 1FastSTi, definitely some tobacco going on here.  Mouthfeel is soo smooth and full, but not cloying despite being really sweet and having a super long aftertaste.  Overall this is a really remarkable beer.  I wish I would have gotten more of this last winter.  I love this brewery!","Santa Cruz, California, USA","amorphiss"
315,"2007-06-18",4.7,"Holy crap am I happy I was able to have tried this.  Thanks Jason for sharing.  The beer pours to a dark brown body with a very thin white head.  The aroma is huge.  Tobacco and sweet vanilla bourbon.  Ultra-complex and very good.  Woody, barley, and hard to describe its so masterfully blended.  The flavor is caramelized goodness with heavily fermented tobacco, vanilla, nutty maduro cigars, did I mention tobacco?  Strong old ale components too.  The palate is rich and earthy with lots of caramelly goodness going on.  Creamy, full bodied, rich.  Perfect palate.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
315,"2007-06-16",3.6,"Hugely pronounced malt presence in the aroma - big chocolate and caramelly brown sugar with some distracting alcohol in back.  Surprisingly aroma for such a still beer.  Somewhat grainy. Primarily sweet flavor - woodily subdued chocolate malt and dark plummy crystal malts.  Big strong flavors but they are distracted by some noticeable alcohols.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
315,"2007-06-16",4.6,"Bottle thanks to styles!  Poured a still, deep, and smoky translucent caramel.. ugly, but calculating.  Aroma was killer.. deep, smoky, and vibrant with rich toasted caramel, spicy herbal accents, tobacco, vanilla, and well-rounded bourbon.. soft, intricate, and expertly complex!  Flavor was not far behind.. sweet vanilla bean and bourbon grace the tip of the tongue.. warm vanilla and bourbon ride across the middle, and the finish was characterized by bourbon-laced caramels.. layers of dried tobacco and leaves laced through the elixir.. long, warm, wonderful finish.  Sweet and supple on the palate.. warm, but not sharp.. accented by the barrel influence at every stage of the drink, but never defined by it.  This was a masterpiece.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

315,"2007-04-20",4.2,"Just found my rating of this from trip to the brewery in December.  Pours with a light tan head.  Aroma is rich of vanilla, some spice, caramel and bourbon.  Taste is much the same.  Huge flavor with a lot going on.  I think I like the regular fourth dimentia slightly better.  But this is still amazing.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"
315,"2007-04-14",4.3,"Bottle shared by leopoldStoch at Columbus tasting 6, thanks! Dirty dark brown pour with a light tan head. Aromas of chocolate, spices, vanilla, oak and other bourbon elements along with bready malt. Flavors of bourbon and vanilla, light spices and chocolate seemed to be the most evident. Sweet with a nice warming booziness and a sublte spiciness...somewhat hot boozey finish. A nice winter warmer to be sure, this stuff was good!","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
315,"2007-03-27",4.1,"Thanx to Boboski for this.This was a real treat.Pours a a nice dark copper with a fasr dissipating head.Has a medicine like aroma.The alcohol was present but not dominant.Hints of chocolate, dark fruits and bourbon.The finish was a tad spicy with the alcohol lingering a bit.","Groveport, Ohio, USA","DragonStout"
315,"2007-03-25",3.9,"Dense, mostly opaque chestnut and mahogany body. Barely visible but steady carbonation rises up through a muddy looking, thick, semi-oily liquid, but never manages to form a real head. Lacing is sparse but thick and gobby. Aroma is comprised of heavy caramel malt, mild oxidation(but a pleasant variety, from extended barrel aging no doubt), cocoa, nutty malts, some light tinges of fruit. Bourbon in the nose is elegant, heavy and smells of quality. Tannic notes and dark citrus mingle with vanilla and alcohol, bouncing wildly off each other with each whiff. Toasted malts come to light as the glass warms. This certainly tastes like barrel aged 4th Dementia, but it also seems like it spent too long in the barrel. Sweet, sugary caramel and vanilla are the predominant tastes, backed by more citrus and fig notes. Very tasty, but the standard offering was much more exciting. Palate is oily and unrefined with biting tannins. Mouthfeel is succulently full. Finishes moderately sweet, then leaves a lingering semi-dry barrel and toasted caramel twang behind. The thing about this beer that stands out the most is how much less life it has than the standard 4th Dementia...some things are better left as they were intended originally.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
315,"2007-03-22",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2007 Courtesy boboski. Ugly, dark multi brown pour, no carbonation. Nose of roasted caramel, big time old woodsy oak, cocoa powder, dark dried fruits, subtle bourbon alcohol, graham crackers, toasted almonds, light vanilla. Flavor of chocolate nougat, roasted caramel and vanilla, same old woodsy oak, rich  cookie/graham cracker malt, light dose of bourbon, fig, toasted almonds, fresh tobacco, and just a bit of resinous hops towards the finish that also hang around in the aftertaste. Full body, smooth, viscous, a little carbonation. This beer is a lesson in barrel aging, providing compliments to the rich malty brew instead of stealing the show. Excellent.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
315,"2007-03-17",3.9,"A good beer from a great brewery I never get to. I will regret that one day. But this beer...goes down solid. Heavy bourbon taste. Only drawback: you will taste that bourbon for the next day or two. It will stick to your tongue like a bad memory.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
315,"2007-03-04",4.2,"Bottle shared by leopoldStoch at Columbus tasting 6 - Pours brown murky with a small offwhite head.  Aromas of bourbon caramel, oak soaked in vanilla and some slight hops at the finish.  Flavor is equally as good with lots of bourbon but not overpoweringly so.  Caramel, Oak notes, and a good amount of vanilla.  Warmth on the back of each sip but very smooth and low carbonation.  This is an awesome beer..","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
315,"2007-03-03",4.5,"#700---Big props to leopoldstoch for sharing this at C-bus 6.  Lots of sweet malt scents with some bourbon.  Dark brown body with little head.  Medium to full palate offers a great mix of sweet, sugary tastes mixed with some roasted malts and caramel malts.  A hint of the alcohol shows up--but nothing that detracts from the experience.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"
315,"2007-03-03",4.1,"Thanks to Styles for the bottle!!  If you like the regular 4th dementia...this one was great.  Some bourbon in the nose with lots of sweet caramel and chocolate malts.  The taste is melded very well with the sweet caramel sugars, the slight roastiness of an old ale, the bourbon, and some oak/woodsy characteristics as well.  Very good brew, and I am very glad I got the chance to try it!","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
315,"2007-02-21",4.2,"Draugh at EBF on 2/10/07The base being my favorite beer at Kuhnhenn, I was pretty eager to see how this one turned out.Tan head is small to moderate in size, fading fairly rapidly to partial cover and leaving blotchy lacing/film on the glass.  Clarity is low on the dark blackish-brown body.Being served extremely cold certainly did not help, but as with the regular beers (which is also served very cold at the brewpub) patience is the key.  A bright fruitiness folded in to lush chocolate and caramel malts with a strong amount of oaky-finish is quickly noted.  Creamy-sweet vanilla mixes with almost a cherry cola note that is further supported by light pineapple and coconut notes.  As in the base beer, the booziness is extremely controlled for its size and lends only a touch of sharpness/heat on the finish.  Coarse wood tannins take the dryness level up a notch on this usually quite sweet beer, while dark fruits and light coffee notes add further complexity.  Very high strength of aroma.  The barrel goes very well with the beer, though I think it could have been taken off a few months earlier than it was.  Lots of oak, coconut and pineapple make for quite a different beer, though I wont say in a bad way.Dark chocolate supported by creamy-sweet malts produce a chocolatey flavor with bits caramel.  Redolent of brownies soaked in dark rum, with some moderate saltiness and dry toffee emerging.  Vanilla and spicy, very dry bourbon notes are quite apparent and its a bit strong on the wood tannin sharpness, contributing some acidity that dices up the malt to the point where there is some over-thinning on the body.  Raisins, plums, light cherries and vanilla are all plastered to the palate, while the deep, chocolatey malts seek to recover their former dominance.  In the end, its certainly flavorful and enjoyable, but I find it a bit too heavy on the barrel character.  Still, its very close and probably only a matter of preference.  Its not like they went crazy on the barrel.  Rich, warming, without any syrupiness or tacky sweetness.  Low carbonation.  I think the aroma benefited the most from this experiment, but Ill still take the regular stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
315,"2007-02-18",4.5,"Secret small keg at EBF.  Thanks to Eric for hooking me up with a few samples.  Pours a dark woody almost muddled brown and a thin head.  Aroma of the usual thickly sweet caramel and toasted malts found in the regular 4th, with more wood character and light bourbon, but it isnt overly bourbony or oaky like some other BA aged beers.  Great full flavor loaded with caramelized sugar and malts, dried fruits, light apricot, some vanilla, light oak, moderate bourbon.  Silky smooth mouthfeel and the same great texture as the normal 4th.  Obviously a great beer, if you like the regular version.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
315,"2007-02-13",4.1,"date is unknown but Im guessing it came from the 2/16/05 batch before resting in the barrel. Sampled next to non-BA 4th Dementia. Poured mahogany without as much red tint as the non-ba version had, and theres no head. Nose is similar to the non-ba version but not as complex and fruity, the bourbon barrel seems to have created a mask of sweetness like maple syrup over the plum and raspberry notes along with charred wood. However, this version seems to have more dark chocolate in the nose. I preferred this nose of the non-ba version only slightly, it seemed more complex and haunting. Flavor notes are sharper and darker than the non-ba version. The bourbon provides more of a sweet plum and raspberry taste and splashed with bourbon. Some chocolate and caramel notes as well. This beer seems to be a tad hot in the beginning and in the finish (probably more like 12-13%). Mouthfeel also seems a tad thin. Carbination is really low. this is very tasty and intriguing but too hot and not an extremely complex flavor.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

315,"2007-02-10",3.6,"Tap at Spuyten Duyvil: pours a dark redish brown with no head at all.  A little syrupy, flavor of dark fruits with a sweet and smooth finish.  I also did pick up a little of the alcohol when tasting.  A nice brew.","New York, New York, USA","bp"
315,"2007-02-06",3.9,"Tap at Spuyten Duyvil: Pours a beautiful hazy burgundy with no head. The aroma is slightly vinous with a hint of speariment and a berry-like fruityness. Rich malt background balanced by a fruit accented body. Raspberries, pomegranetes, green grapes. Slight boozy flavors come through with a light earthy undertone. As it warms more minty flavors develop. Theres a touch of roastyness in the toffee-like malt finish, and an unabrasive hint of alcohol. A rich and fruity Old Ale.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
315,"2007-01-17",3.9,"thanks to Styles for picking this up at Kuhnhenns the day after Christmas and to my son for bringin it home.  12 oz. bottle, from the Kuhnhenn Holiday gift pack.  
thought I was smelling a super sweet Jim Beam manhattan, strong bourbon on the nose!  pours a hazy brown without much head, yet leaves a small ring of tan lace all the way to the finish.  like a lot of Kuhnhenn brews, this one is very sweet.  flavor is caramel, brown sugar and lots of malt.  even with the other flavors, bourbon dominates.  unlike the regular 4th Dementia, this does not seem as complex, because of the overriding bourbon dominance.  still a very nice winter warmer on a cold January night.","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
