2164,"2016-07-29",3.2,"@ SOPP 2016, Helsinki. Pours hazy amber with a little white head. The aroma features sweet banana, juniper and rye - fairly standard for a sahti. Taste has a very rustic vibe to it proving once again that sahti is the antithesis of clean commercial bulk beers; not difficult to believe that a beer like this has been drunk in some regions in Finland for centuries. This sahti is a bit different to others I have had: it starts sweet but surprisingly sweetness fades fairly quickly giving way to bready maltiness and sourness of berries; not much banana. The palate is very thick and full-bodied, flat and sticky. An interesting curiosity among modern beers but I prefer sweeter and not quite as full-bodied sahtis. Had a taste of Mallassahti also and it was tastier in my opinion.","Helsinki, FINLAND","Marstonlad"

2164,"2015-07-27",2.8,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2016 Tap (SOPP2015, Helsinki) (6:4:6:1:11=2.8)
Sahti in a western-Finnish style, at 7-8%, according to the brewer. Gloudy golden marmalade colour, brief head. Really earthy aroma, muddy, even. Jeeez, thats the slimiest palate Ive ever encountered. No crispness, not even wateriness, just pure slickness. Taste is also earthy, with a nice dry peppery spiciness in the finish - thats the best bit. Grassy too, almost mouldy, and so much drying white pepper. Not sure if there are hops in here or not - I sure get the pepperiness of old midget wild hops, but someone said it was just juniper, no hops in the recipe. Odd, and not saying 7%. However, its hard to drink, even oppressive.
Rerate: Tap (HBF2016) (74:7:4:15=3.7) at 8%
Bogus that this should be forced under the same entry as a rerate, the recipe is so different from before. Sahti banana aroma. Thick palate, but pleasant carbonation. Sweetish, light barley breadiness. Finish sweet and grainy. Not particularly saying rye to me, but not saying 8% either.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
