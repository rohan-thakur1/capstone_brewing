Deep burnished bronze in color.The nose is full of fresh, aromatic hops contributing both fruitiness (cherries, apples, lemons) and fresh cut, green grass. The perfect amount of dried hay and very light biscuit sits in the background, while a large amount of minerality and light honey play about as well. Absolutely stunningly clean, fresh and with not a single thing to complain about, really.The flavor is more of the same, with a soft, malty, yet well-attenuated texture featuring sourdough drizzled with honey-like maltiness, fresh grass, light floral notes and very gentle lemon and apricot fruit notes.

Pours a nice hazy golden color with a great head and nice lacing on the glass, its a very nice looking glass of beer. 

The aroma is really something, doughy & yeasty. Its bright but only lightly fruity, its got some limestone, and a good wallop of herbal hoppy character. 

The flavor is mildly sweet but never overly so, its plenty hoppy in a grassy and herbal way and its got plenty of bitterness to balance things out. The malt character is very soft but at the same time ubiquitous and very identifiable. The finish is dry and clean. As the beer warms it shows some light honey and some faint fruitiness at moments, but thats sort of fleeting.

I ended up having this one back to back with the regular pilsner urquell. The first bar I went to thought they had it, but it was the import version. I was lucky to find this on tap at Local Option. 
Pours a golden yellow with a white head. The first difference that I notice is the aroma. That is a big difference. This does remind me of fresh pilsners and helles I consumed in Europe. Sweet doughy malts. reminiscent of cotton candy. Some herbal saaz spice. The regular lacks this vibrancy in aroma flavor and mouthfeel. As it opens up the flavor difference is more apparent than my first sip. Sweet malts smooth malts that the yeast rounds out. Some herbal bitterness. Balanced and really tasty with a dry noble hop finish. A fuller and creamier mouth feel. This IS really good. Though the regular is decent, the unfiltered version is far superior.

The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy, over carbed really, carbonation would probably be better from an oak cask (so I guess the search sorta continues). Ive been wanting this beer for several years and besides not being on the urquell cellar tour this doesnt disappoint. 4.0

6/5/14 cask at The Radler, sampled next to draft filtered version. This cask version is quite a bit better than the unfiltered draft i had before (see rating above) this just has tons of character, heart and soul. subtle oak brings a mild funk to it, nice full mouth feel, wonderful pilsner. 4.2","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Nose is heavily skunky up front, moves to some orange sticky fruits and a lot of sweet honey roll. Taste is not really bitter or even what I would consider pilsner-like as it brings soft Hawaiian sweet roll, a lot of corn surprisingly, biscuit, and someone was mentioning ""toasted corn"" which I can see. Interesting, but certainly not hoppy or sharply biting like an agressive pilsner. Palate is aerated with some oil density. In the finish there is some rich caramel and flan dessert. Reminds me more of a prohibition lager of sorts that I would expect from Jacks Abby than a pilsner in any sense. Still, loving the palate and the character even if all around the flavor caught me off guard. (also note that I was instructed to take ""big swigs"" of this beer via MJ, which I did) Wife gave this a 3.5.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

How good can a traditional, unfiltered, unpasteurized Czech style Pils really be? The answer is very simple: really fucking good. Pours a slightly hazy, deep gold with some extremely frothy, creamy, lacing white head. Honestly, it looks like perfection. The nose is very nice too, malt, dried crackers, mild honey, almost like white toast with honey spread over, a little light brie rind lurking, some mild lemon. Flavor is just spot on, gently toasted white bread, some biscuit with honey, lemon, some grass, a little straw. The finish is really the icing on the cake, its clean and creamy at the same time.

The drinkability is unsurpassed. I was drinking one beer all the time almost all day and never got tired with it. Try to beat that!
Original rating: Hazy golden, lasting head. Aroma of straw and bready malt, combined with lots of lovely Saaz hoppiness (herbal, grassy, hay, some lemon), bound together by a subtle yeastiness. Full malty body, a light yeasty tartness and even some salty hints, with a moderately strong bitterness and a bready-herbal aftertaste. Shy hints of diacetyl and honey.

4512,"2008-07-08",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2008 On tap at Na Parkanu.  I had been travelling all day from London to Plzen and I had humped my luggage halfway across town to my hotel, before heading down here to meet up with the rest of the RBESG.  I hadnt had a drink all day and it had been very hot by English standards.  So by 19.30 I was gasping for a cold beer.  Which makes this probably explains partly why I liked it so much.  Slightly cloudy gold, thick off white head.  Earthy aroma.  Yeast.  This is gorgeous.  Some bitterness/yeast/earthy.  So refreshing.  Almost tastes as if it was dryhopped with earthy hops.  That is awesome. 4.3/5.0.
Re-rate 2 days later on the Saturday evening with Chris_o and Ruth. I still absolutely loved this, but I knocked 0.1 off now that I had time to reflect more on it.  Still the best Czech beer I had over the weekend and the only one I conciously went back for.  We had a filtered pint inbetween 2 unfiltered and the difference really was startling.  The unfiltered is just so much better.
Re-rate-unfiltered from the brewery from the wood.  Hazy gold, thin lasting white head, slightly woody yeast, hoppy aroma.  I think maybe more intense than the Na Parkanu version, bit more uncultured, more hoppy, but I prefer the Na Parkanu more 3.8/5.0","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

4512,"2008-07-02",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2008 Draught @ the brewery. This was the barrel aged version, and boy had I been waiting for this one. My wife took a sip of her glass and gave the rest to me, so I ended up with two glasses of this wonderful brew. It was possible to take the glass out of the brewery and I was sipping away for over an hour. Quite amazingly the beer really opened up as every minute passed. This was and properly well be the best Pilsener that I will ever taste. If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would properly be it. As the brew master pored into the glass, a huge thick fin foamed head was forming and slowly settled into a medium - large almost creamy like white head. Color was cloudy shining gold with a sparkling appearance. Aroma was hope juice, mild grassy, citrus, hope oiled, dusty  earthy floral or flower like. As time passed the lovely dry wood notes began to surface with hint of tingling toasted malty notes. The palate was again a chapter in it self with unbelievable chewy creamy smooth hoppy texture, mild fruity notes and again wood dry feel. Medium to almost full bodied with a surprisingly lively carbonation. Flavor was just so well balanced with moderated to almost heavy bitter - sweet and what could appear as a hint of acidic. Lingering wood and earthy  dusty floral finish. This just was so tasty and amazingly well balanced. It might have been the surroundings or the tour and magic of being there, but I really did have an exceptional experience with this beer.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"

4512,"2008-06-05",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2013 Draft at Na Parkanu in Plzen served in a dimpled 500ml mug

This is the same beer as that which is served on the brewery tour, only this one is from the tanks while the tour provides you with the wood barrel version.

Cloudy bright brass colored body with a large fluffy white head. The nose is amazingly fresh hoppy Saaz cones, moderate yeast presence noticed, and the smell is perfectly balanced clean pils malt and dry, grassy hops.  Flavor is wet and delicious and slightly sweet up front, then crispness explodes in a rush of grassy, fresh Saaz... drying and bittering into a long, refreshing finish complete with some lemon zest, faint minerally yeast notes and crisp cracker pils malt.  Hands down the best pilsener Ive ever had (8/5/10/5/18 = 4.6), until about two hours later, when 


At the end of the Plzensky Prazdroj tour, we sampled the Kvasnicovy from the wooden barrel.  The look is still a cloudy, soft gold and the head is still rocky and foamy and attractive.  The nose has a burst of funky yeast and tart, dry, (mildly) pungent wood.  Flavor has some amazing dry wood over the back, a light funk that is unique and almost confuses my tongue.  Amazingly refreshing overall, the finish has that mild wood and medium to heavy yeast presence to go along with the crisp, crackery, dry malt and dry, grassy hops.  This one stands up to scrutiny, its a fantastic pilsener and youll have trouble finding a better one.

4512,"2008-06-02",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2008 Draft at Na Parkanu and from the barrel on the brewery tour.  As in Glouglouburps fantastic scientific presentation rating, my number stands for the barrel version from the tour. 
Considering that my guide gave me a big cup and told me to go get a second helping( I had built up a mighty thirst on the two hour + tour) I was as close to heaven as a living man is able to get. While the unfiltered and unpasturized version of this critter is yeasty, raw oak infused and has some citrus zest, the peary/peach nose then peppery hop tones were the highlight for me.  Some agressive hopping enable this beer to extend its nice dry finish into something that makes your taste buds awaken and drool for another mouthful.  At one point I thought I would pull a Mickey Rourke from Barfly and just stick my mouth under the tap.  This beer is truly worth the pilgramage to the hallowed caves.  Outstanding and humbling.","Hippetown East, New York, USA","coldbrewky"
4512,"2008-05-14",4.3,"[Unfiltered, unpasteurized, barrel-fermented. From the brewery tour] 

Very cloudy yellowish/golden color. Nice dense foam on top of my small sample glass. Aroma is FRESH. Fresh yeast, fresh grassy hops. Delicious. The malt character seems to be a bit subdued by all the other complexities of this beer. Yeast character is quite dominant, but not really overpowering (or providing much, if any diacetyl.). Hop character is strong and grassy. Quite bitter. The fermentation within the barrel seems to provide some interesting character to the beer overall... kind of musty and wet. Another layer of complexity. 

Overall, this beer was one of the highlights of my beer-focused trip abroad.  Outstanding, overall. Ill be lucky if Im able to try this one again.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","BitchesBrew"
4512,"2008-05-06",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2008 IMPORTANT NOTE: There exists many versions of this beer.  The unfiltered Pilsner Urquell available at Na Parkanu, the un-pasteurized Pilsner Urquell available at U Zlatého Tygra and the unfiltered-un-pasteurized in wooden Pilsner Urquell Barrel available at the end of the brewery tour.  I see that people are entering ratings for the regulars and wooden-barrel ones here.  Im reviewing all three but the score is for the wooden barrel one.  The two first one can arguably remain one entry in ratebeer but the one aged in wooden barrels should definitely be a separate entry.  It is totally different from the other  two.  Totally different aroma and taste.  It even looks totally different
Unfiltered Pilsner Urquell: 3.9
In short: Typical 
How: Tap at Na Parkanu, Pilsen, Czech Republic
The look: Almost clear golden body with a large but quickly diminishing white head.
In long: Overall rather inexpressive malts with some pleasant hay.  Hopping is something else, wonderful hops bouquet.  Sharp medium bitterness with a little lemon twist.  The beer gets dry before the finish and the finish is very dry.  Didnt feel unbalanced despite the intense hopping and inexpressive malts. 
Un-pasteurized Pilsner Urquell: 3.8
How: Tap at U Zlatého Tygra
The look: Almost clear golden body with a large off-white head.
In long: Very similar to the above but with a little tiny bit of added acidity. 
Unfiltered un-pasteurized aged in wooden barrel Pilsner Urquell:4.9
How: From the barrel at the end of the brewery tour
The look: Cloudy golden yellow body with a small white head.
In long: Round and chewy body.  Very woody but a different type of wood than what we get from that new trend of barrel-aged-xyz.  This felt like freshly cut wet wood.  Unlike its non-barrel-aged unfiltered sisters the hopping on that one is dry grassy and slightly lemony.  Here it felt juicy citrusy which is obviously something coming of a strange alliance between the wood barrels and the hops.  Some dry grass on the come-back only.  Softer than usual carbonation and it fitted perfectly with the fresh chewy juicy body.  Fruity notes are light but rather complex with peaches, bananas, pears and more.  But overall its that freshness feeling that enchanted me.  During my Czech Republic pub crawl the freshness was a key ingredient but never as much as in this beer.  This felts like it was just harvested from some kind of magical beer tree.  To say this beer is highly drinkable is an understatement. 
In Conclusion:While the unfiltered and un-pasteurized Pilsner Urquells are superior Pilsners (certainly far superior to the regular Pilsner Urquell) it is really the unfiltered-un-pasteurized aged in wooden barrel Pilsner Urquell that is the shit.  Brewed in very limited quantity it unfortunately never leaves the wet caves of the brewery.  It is unfortunate that like the penis of an obese man this beer will never see the light of day because it will remain alone in its wet and moist spot and no-one will ever abuse it.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4512,"2007-12-01",3.3,"From the barrel at the end of the brewery tour in Plzen. Head is white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy medium to dark yellow.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Not quite worth the somewhat dull tour, but its interesting and kind of odd that such a thing exists from such a large brewery. Its sourish, as portended by the yeasty state its in, but in a slightly harsh fruit-juicy kind of way (as one or two other unfiltered lagers I had on this trip were, much like British bitters can be when the cask is old), which becomes more prominent as it warms.

4512,"2006-09-13",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2008 Simply the best.  A sharp, clean taste with a slight bitterness that leaves you wanting more. What all other Pilseners should be judged by.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","canslovak"

4512,"2006-08-13",4.8,"Nothing beats this beer.  I have tried it from the brewery in Plzen and no other beer compares to this true original.  The Saaz hops are number one in the world.  There are young women that pick these in the fields.  Bohemia is where all and any real beer has come from and there is no better place to have it than from the original brewery.","British Columbia, CANADA","Mirek"

4512,"2006-06-20",4.4,"Had this one during the brewery tour out of one of the barrels. Beautiful hazy golden color, short head. Aroma and taste of a perfect bohemian pilsener, nicely bitter, complex. Probably the best pilsener i have ever tasted.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
4512,"2006-06-19",4.9,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2007 On tap (from the barrel at the brewery 30 days ""old"", at the pub U Parkanu 60 days ""old"") Hazy, golden coloured, fluffy to firm head; fresh, fruity nose with a touch of yeast and hoppiness (Saazer Roter Mittelfrüh); creamy mouthfeel, not so malty as the filtered version, but a nice bitter-sweet flavour. Soft, but distinctive bitter-aromatic finish. Extremely well quaffable, well balanced..........Worth a journey, českemú pivu zdar !!!!!!!!","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"

4512,"2006-01-29",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2008 I tried this as a commercial version at the pub close to the brewery museum in Pilzen. I also tried it during the tour in the basement of the brewery, straight from a barrelTried it at two different occasions, both at Na Parkanu and in the tunnels at both visits.
Pretty special and a nice extra touch to this very special and great beer. Its even better when tasted unfiltered.Nice cloudy yeloow color, big fluffy frothy white head. Herbal hoppy fresh scent. Also hoppy herbal taste. Medium high bitterness. Amazing full fresh mouthfeel.

4512,"2005-08-08",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2009 On tap at Na Parkanu in Plzen, in 2005 and 2008:

The Lure:Vibrating pink grapefruit with a little sugar on it. Starfruit, lemony hops and peppery freshness are bright at first, but slowly become veiled, as you get used to it. Not much maltiness here.

The Festivities:A plethora of citrus fruit combines with the white peppery yeast to develop a decorous but never overwhelming bitterness. Body is quenching and very slender, maybe a bit thinner in its maltiness than the regular Pilsner Urquell. Gorgeous pink grapefruit, but obviously not of the Cascade-y origin, are lifted by the prickly and engaging carbonation. Orange zest and yeast hangs on to the back hop bitterness admirably well. This isnt that complex, but it is very flavorful and different from most Bohemian Pilseners. If it had a filet of malt similar to its filtered counterpart, it would be great I think, but as is it is not much more than any very good American Pale Ale can offer. Just very rare, historical, and pleasantly hoppy. 3.8/5

Transcendence:The sight and warming of dawn.

At the end of the brewery tour:
The body appears to be slightly fuller and the hops are truly evocative, ramifying into coniferous, wooden notes as they lay sheets of bitterness onto the tongue. Hoppier, bulkier, yet as fresh and drinkable as any other Pilsner Urquell. The wooden barrel job is simply perfect and its link with the hops is stunning. Much better than the already very good kvasnicovy from stainless steel tanks available at Na Parkanu. 4.3/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
4512,"2005-03-29",4.2,"At the brewery, in the cellars, plastic cup. 
Hazy, almost yellow, cottony head. Big aroma from exotic fruits and Saaz. Herbal, almost tea-like in flavour with a tang of peach. Distinct but very well balanced bitterness. After, we went to Na Parkanu, but THEY DID NOT HAVE IT!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"
4512,"2005-03-22",4.4,"It is great to have a look at my fellow countrymens ratings. Not just out of interest but to see what I have missed. This is truly a delightful beer and now that it has been separately included in the database I can talk about a beautifully presented and flavoursome drink. On my tour were 4 Germans, 2 Frenchmen and an Austrian. All thought their drinks were the superior ones, much to the disgust of the Czech guide. He dispensed little samples to them and as they wandered off kept me back and poured a full half litre from the wood. Well you get what you drink. Clean and gentle with a genuine hit of the Zatec (Czech for Saaz) this one is a mothers milk type of experience that can only be expereinced at the original source.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

4512,"2005-03-14",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2009 on tap at na parkanu in plzen and on the pu brewery tour. lagered in wooden barrels. quite hazy and golden with a big whipped cream head. very fresh aroma of peach and saaz. quite a grassy flavour hint of iced tea and then loads of bitterness tastes like chewing on a saaz pellet. not sure if its any better than the regular draught pu at na spilce at the brewery. the yeast gves it a kellerbier character with a hint of passionfruit and slight yeast bite but the taste is not quite as clean as the regular urquell. well worth a visit to na parkanu which is located next to the brewing museum just off the main square in plzen. tasting it on the brewery tour has the advantage of being direct from the barrel in the cellar but you do have to sit through a tedious promotional video","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
