184,"2012-09-17",3.9,"Entering old rates. Draft @ CCB and at Datz Deli. Couleur brune allant vers acajou, col épais beige. Arôme garde ce bouquet de seigle, laissant place à une brève note épicée-grains, le tout est accompagné dun malté profond entre chocolat renforcé par ce profile léger de cumin. The pour yields a dark mahogany colored body with a glint of copper-chestnut translucency at the edges.
Palais est complexe épais alternant malt chocolaté/grille houblonné légèrement en retrait pour lamertume et une pointe épicée du seigle. Notable aussi ce côté Kümmel typique allemande et qui rajoute un léger soupçon de médicinal.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
184,"2012-02-03",3.7,"This porter was very interesting. Behind the usual rich cocoa and earthy notes arose a strong rye twang. The finish was the best though, nice and dry with a bitter bread aftertaste.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"

184,"2011-08-15",3.9,"Tap at Kickbacks in Jax, FL. The pour is a deep cola red with an enormous, chunky, coffee head. Looks almost like a nitro pour. Very nice retention and big lacing. Nose is dark chocolate and raspberry and currants. Lots of red fruits. As it warms I come to the realization that this beer is actually funky. Sitting with it, I discover that somehow this batch of beer has been infected with Jolly Pumpkins terroir of wild yeast and bacteria. No joke. Straight up JP funk in the nose without a doubt. Must be from the Jolly Pumpkin barrels that have been sitting around in the brewery. The nose is excellent though: tropical fruits and pineapple with tart raspberry and mild acetobacter. Taste is quite tart and probably more attenuated than was intended. Spicy rye and fennel comes to balance providing earth to interplay with sharp lactic sourness and fruit. Thinner palate but not watery by any means. Perhaps an unintended masterpiece.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

184,"2011-03-30",4.3,"I love being out and getting to try local or bar only ticks! Had no idea what the Soggy Loaf was so I ordered it, better find after I learned it was a CCB. On-tap poured into a pint glass... Pours a very dark brown, sheeny glow. Not much, or any, carbonation on this though... The aroma is a touch light but its very good, so much going on but well integrated. It has a great standard porter backbone of coffee with some nice chocolate, but then there is tons of grainy rye, its deep and strong, they meld 50/50 perfectly. Some additional notes of caramel and hops add even more. Smells great... The taste is equally impressive, an extension of the nose, its just outstanding. Some bitter coffee at first, chocolate undertones, rye, with a slight pine finish.

184,"2010-10-09",4.1,"Draft at Datz Deli. This one pours a very dark mahogany brown color and topped by a small, begie colored head of foam that settles slowly leaving some sudsy drips of lace on the glass. The aroma shows notes of rich chocolate and caramel as the base along with notes of roast, spicy rye and caraway seed, and some earthy hops for balancing bitterness. The flavor follows and shows a nice balance between rich caramel, chocolate, molasses, and roast, which are countered by the earthy hops and spicy rye bread character. The caraway seed adds another element and shines through nicely. Medium bodied, smooth and creamy on the palate sporting good carbonation that leads to a semi-dry, spicy finish. This is a great beer and my favorite of the 3 porters that have been made. It also goes perfectly with the awesome sandwhiches at Datz.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

It has an interesting aroma with an even mix of chocolate, roasty malts, spiciness and earthiness with an underlying carameliness. The taste begins with a pleasing pulse of chocolate brownie and spiciness and then moving toward earthiness, dark roasted malts and a slim (by dieting) level of caramel candy.

184,"2010-08-31",3.9,"Draft at Redlight Redlight.  Oooohhh boy, this stuff is good.  The pour yields a dark mahogany colored body with a glint of copper-chestnut translucency at the edges.  A small, creamy head of khaki foam gives some wet, drooping ribbons of lacing.  Aromas are based in cocoa and dried molasses, spiced beautifully with sharp, distinct caraway seed, and hopped nicely with moderate, earthen bitterness.  Flavors follow suit, displaying a soft richness from the caramel, molasses, dry chocolate, and cream, balanced perfectly by soft, earthy hops and spicy rye bread.  The caraway seed is an essential element, and it really brightens things up.  On the palate, a smooth, creamy consistency and soft but sufficient carbonation are highlights, as is the semi-dry, balanced finish.  The balance is incredible throughout.  Great beer.  I hope to see this one go year-round.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The finishing flavors linger for a while.  Great porter that Im glad to have tried this fresh.  Awesome.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"
