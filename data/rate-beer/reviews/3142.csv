Theyre all spectacular, this one just happens to be the juiciest. Pours a cloudy medium gold with minimal head or lace.

3142,"2014-09-29",4.4,"375ml bottle acquired via trade on BA. Thanks! Excited to pop some more of these. Pours a lush orange amber hue, a bit hazy with lovely fleshy peach and orange glow. A bit fiery, frothy whitish head atop stays as a decent ringer, nice spidery lacing with mellow ring that sticks around. Aromas are quite lovely, white grape and melon meet firmer peach, tart and nectar sweetness. More meolon, fruity white wine with touches of oak, some green apple, lemon and lactic elements start to assert a bit. Tannic white wine, touch of honey and firmer tropical fruit melange play. Delicate but envelopes the sense. Quite lovely stuff, a gentle funkiness, decent sourness hits the nose. Initial is fuzzy and vibrant, decent hits of sour peach, tart and lovely with some funky hits, horseblanket and cobwebs meet some decent oak. Lemon, melon and oaky life comes on. White wine, subtle melon and white grape. Touches of dryness hits and balances well. Good firm sour bite, a bit citric and sour with some acidity, lactic and yogurty backend with some decent funk, tannic oak. Really nice flow here. The sourness and fruit all come together, never getting harsh, but instead integrating in a lovely manner, potent strong flavors assert but overall this is quite crushable, complex, nuanced and a really nice work here. Finish is tart, dry, lemon and orange meet sour and sweet peach nectar, jabs of tropical fruit, white grape, citrus and mellow yogurty, funk elements taper out, touch of cheesecloth and .
