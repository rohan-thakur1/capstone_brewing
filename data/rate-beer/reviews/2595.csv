Some fruity, almond-y yeast aromas as as well. Starts malty, rich, and sweet with a clear fruity and spicy yeast flavor, probably fermented hot. Not nearly as smoky as the aroma suggests, but its there, especially in the finish, where that woodiness sticks around,but not unpleasantly. The juniper builds over time to really numb the tongue. Has little hop flavor or aroma. Has some vanilla, lighter chocolate notes. Surprisingly light body. Nice and warming. Very good beer and unique.","","AaronTDubs"
2595,"2016-10-23",3.2,"Draft at Holy Grale. Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie, toasted grain), moderately yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket), with light notes of mint, smoke, gum, candy sugar. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, fizzy/lively carbonation.

Rather candy-ish in the mouth; not enough acid or bitterness to clean up the sugars, but at least its not goopy. Its a neat beer otherwise, though, if maybe playing it too safe. Herbs/mint and smoke notes are nice but they could both be more assertive. Close to being quite good.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2595,"2015-09-30",3.6,"Poured from a tap at Taps. 
Aroma is fairly smokey with some light caramel notes. Some dark fruit character of plums and prunes with some lighter berry and cherry. As your nose adjusts to the smoke you get a lot more of the caramel and dark fruits. 
Pours a fairly clear, amber brown with a small, tan head that recedes quickly to the edges. No lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with a moderate smoke note, though perhaps a bit less prevalent than in the aroma. Moderate dark fruit notes, mostly prune, berry, cherry and plum. Medium caramel with some light toasted bread and hints of honey. Medium low bitterness. Some medium light phenolic notes, juniper or the like. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an interesting beer. Its similar to a smokey red ale but with more dark fruit character and less toasted and nutty malt notes. At first the smoke is very strong, but it diminishes as your palate adjusts. An interesting, and unique beer. This is one of those beers where the minimal carbonation probably helps it.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

2595,"2014-06-09",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Alder-smoked malts pervade this Stjørdalsøls aroma and flavor profile, bathing in a voluptuous and soft mouthfeel decorated by candied fruitiness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the gleaming blood red.
-The character of alder smoke is unmistakable. Especially after having had way too many alder-smoked sausages from Norway. ;)
-This one is much more carbonated than the other rustic brews Ive had in Norway.
-Drinkability is relatively high considering the intense smoke.
-This is surprisingly different from Granas Gards Maltøl. But then again, under ten percent of all Stjørdalsøl brewers in this region actually sell their brew. So what do we know of the areas dominating tendencies?
-Hopefully, this brew bears fruit in the region in the form of other brewers making the leap to commercial sales and thus helping preserve the many brewing traditions there. Both these guys, artisanal maltster and microbrewer, could then be pioneers in the eyes of many.

2595,"2013-12-19",3.8,"Small coarseish white head. Hazy deep red body with visible
particles. Smoky earthy juniper aroma with wild red berries and
oily notes. Sweet, and slightly astringent, caramelly smoky
earthy taste with strong juniper notes, and roasted sugar notes.
Mid-bodied. Mild, flat, smooth mouthfeel. Dryish smoky ashy
wild berry aftertaste with roasty earthy herbal juniper notes.
Long, lingering juniper, smoke, and ash finish. Really, really
nice and highly drinkable. Surprisingly elegant, harmonic, and
very moreish. This really is a winner. (0.5l bottle, Cafe Sara.)","Oslo, NORWAY","larsga"
