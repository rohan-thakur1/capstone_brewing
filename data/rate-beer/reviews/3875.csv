3875,"2017-06-18",4.0,"This was recommended to me by the guys at a bottle shop in Minneapolis as the best beer from Minnesota. So I have been sitting on this one for a bit, almost too afraid to try it in case it was disappointing. It was not! Great west coast style IPA and it was just a mouth of bitterness although it was bitter. The floral and citrus of the hops really carry through in the aroma and make for a nice aftertaste. Very impressed with Surly Brewing!

Color is murky with some swirling crumbs, medium amber. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and moderately to heavily bitter. Palate is medium, oily, with a soft carbonation and a lightly astringent finish. Great smelling IPA with a flavor thats just a tad behind the aroma.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

3875,"2017-04-28",4.0,"16oz can. 2/9/17 can date. Appearance: Deep golden, hazy, with a moderate white foam cap. 
Aroma: Grassy with strong tropical fruit (passionfruit, mango), some citrus peel, and a touch of bready malt. 
Taste: Light bready maltiness with an intense tropical fruit of mango and pineapple hop character that slowly builds to an intense resinous bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with a low to moderate carbonation. 
Finish: Very dry. Lingering resinous bitterness with some mango and pineapple fruitiness 
Overall: A really good IPA, with a fairly heavy body and a distinct tropical fruit aroma and flavor of mango and pineapple that dominates the profile. Completely different than the typical pine resin and citrus IPA hop character","","TH28"

Flavor is full of tropical, citrus and dank juiciness, lots of passionfruit, guava, red grapefruit, and blood orange, just a little bit of toasty, lightly caramelized cereal to round it out. Medium body, creamy, to slightly syrupy entry, light, very blanketing and somewhat sharp carbonation, slightly dry, but still juicy finish with a nice hop acid bite.

3875,"2016-11-28",4.2,"Pours a slightly hazed orange color with a small, soon vanishing white head.

Smells of cake coated citrus pulp, together with a subtle blueberry quality. Citrus fruits are dominating the nose in a pleasant way, getting depth from a pithy quality, as well as a flowery softness and dough. There is also a bright note of orange pulp atop the lemon, together with some old ginger, producing an awesomly well smelling beer.

Has a soft medium carbonation, perfectly illustrating the refreshing nature of this beer, while displaying a noteable flavor depth, featuring a solid, sweet malt balance. The beer stays soft on the tongue throughout, while its different flavors come together perfectly.

Tastes of an initial lime bitterness, which immediately gets coated by toffeeish, cakey malts, with the lemon regaining a flowery depth afterwards. The hops take a fruity turn then, revealing passion fruit and orange, which are tied to the omnipresent lemon all the time. Develops a powerful, bitter dryness during the finish, in which a herbal note adds to the hops, and the present malt backbone shrinks to a balancing minimum, providing a note of required dough.

This is an awesomly well made ipa. It is juicy, bitter and refreshing, while integrating a nowadays almost uncommon malt note. This maltiness really does enrich the hops though, which would be a little to harsh and one dimensionally straight forward on the palate otherwise.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3875,"2016-11-14",3.7,"16oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee in a Sam Smith pint glass. Sweet, ripe fruity aromas of peach, nectarine, pear and apricot that really get the mouth watering in a big way. Pours a dense cloudy apricot orange with a thin layer of bubbly white head dissipating quickly into a thin ring, showing surprisingly little carbonation. Powerful and unexpected wallop of melon and pear flavors up front followed by piney hop bitterness and a hoppy, peachy, pineappley finish. Light- to medium-bodied, slightly sweet and mouthcoating, slightly bitter and astringent. Unfiltered solids hide the carbonation at first, but it is there, holding the flavor up keeping the brew light and drinkable. Not bad at all. The citrusy aroma is very nice, the mouthfeel is good and the flavor profile is complex, but the bitterness of it is a little on the heavy side for my taste and the soapy flavor I get from some IPAs is there lingering underneath it all. More than worth my time, based on the hype surrounding this beer alone, but ones gonna be more than enough for me.","Des Moines, Iowa, USA","saltyseadog"

It pours a hazy orange/amber with a thinnish mostly-lasting head...big, bright, tart grapefruit dominates the nose, with hints of sweet cherry and dry hardwood developing...body is citric, tart (grapefruit) and moderately bitter, with a cherry-vanilla softness and sweetness thats nice enough but perhaps a little much...very full with lowish carbonation making the body feel rather too syrupy and sweet overall, and not as bitter or dry at the finish as I would like -and I have a higher tolerance for sweetness in an IPA than many; interestingly this is hoppier at the front and smoother and fruitier late in the experience. I like this quite a bit, but it has too much excellent competition around here (including from its label mate Furious) for me to shell out the extra several dollars that Surly for some reason wants to charge for it; I dont usually comment much on price but in this case I just dont understand the rationale.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

The aroma is pretty good. There is a lot of dank hoppiness up front before a nice citrus juiciness comes through and it's really nice. There is a light pine on the back end. It's interesting and pretty good. The flavor is old. Should've opened this one much earlier. There is a bit of malt up front and a good dank hop. It's not really bitter or bright, but leafy. There is a nice pine train and a hint of juiciness. It's not too bad at all. The mouth feel is syrupy and flat. There isn't a whole lot of good happening there.

This is like 70/30 Mosaic and Citra. I?d like to taste the reverse. Still, this is as rich and nuanced as can be in a hop profile I typically haven?t preferred.  Not worth the $4+ per can, not at all.  Abrasive, Furious, and Overrated are all much better than this.  The one redeeming quality is the subtle Fruit Loops aftertaste.

Pours a nice glowing golden orange hue, a decent haziness, a dulled glow with nice color, frothy whitish head atop stays as a good firm ringer. Nice lacing, aromas show pungent tropical fruit, kiwi and guava meeting a firm citrus slant. Grapefruit, lemon, and mango. Some papaya, juicy grapefruit, florals and a bit of bread. Some nice florals with touches of bread, gentle sweetness. Nice and juicy, rich. Initial is lighter in body, some good bubblegum jabs and tropical fruit. Some touches of florals, citrus and bready malts. Touches of earth, bread, nice fruity bubblegum flavor without being sweet. Middle is juicy and fruity, a good fruity wave with mango, bubblegum, grass and florals. Some gentle sweetness, firm juicy rich hop flavors arent brooding or overwhelming, instead offering potent juicy fruit flavors. Backend a bit more bitter, dry, juicy. Goes down way too easy. Some nice flavors, bitterness and a bit of dry, spiciness as we hit the back and finish. Middling hop bitterness gets a bit swamped by that juicy hop flavor. Touches of pineapple, tropical fruit, citrus, guava and bubblegum trail out with soap, florals, decent bitterness. Nice tasty stuff. A winner. Rich potent nose, great flavors and balance. Could drink a lot of this.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3875,"2014-11-28",4.0,"Pours a cloudy blonde with white head. Loads of mango and papaya, a little pine cone and a big sweetish malty base. Medium bodied palate with balanced malty sweetness and a long and lingering bitterness. Very fresh and very balanced, pretty complex.

3875,"2014-11-21",3.7,"Draft pour at sheffields. Came out clear orange and didn't have any head on it, which scared me that it might be flat. The aroma caught me off guard. Like a sweaty armpit almost. The taste redeemed the pour and smell. Very good. Aggressive fruity and hoppy flavor, citrus and pine flavor. Really tasty","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"
3875,"2014-11-11",3.4,"Softly hazed blonde. Aroma of guava, dank oils, pineapple, flint and white peach; an excellent approximation of the tropical and mineral partnership of the best examples found in the world right now. The flavor struggles to appropriate the purity and cleanliness of aroma, offering bright fruits and brash, fervent planty bitterness in equal measure. The mouthfeel is stripped for character, amplifying the soapy astringency of the aggressive hop quality. As is often the case with Surlys beers, there is no rounding element here; no textural quality or yeast component at all, really. The hop aroma is voluminous and fairly gorgeous, the flavor is bold and unwieldy, and the somewhat intangible general impression is quite blank.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3875,"2014-11-10",4.1,"Tap (Surly Eight Release Party); pours clear gold with a thin off white head; aroma is citrus and floral with a hint of pine; taste is bittersweet tropical fruits and malt; has a dry bitter finish; very nice","Minnesota, USA","gopherfan99"
3875,"2014-11-02",3.8,"On tap. Pours a clear gold with a white head that dissipates quickly to the edges. Aroma has a combination of sweet citrus and earthy resin with some onion and light grain underlying. Flavor starts with pineapple and onion that has a bit of resin that grows through the beer and a touch of grain.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3875,"2014-10-26",4.2,"On tap at Darkness Day. Pours a cloudy gold with medium off white head that lasts. The aroma is citrus and mosiac. Medium mouth with juicy hop, citrus, light dryness, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"

3875,"2014-10-24",3.9,"On tap at Stub & Herbs pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma of resinous pine and tropical hops. Really great flavor balance, tropical hops, mango and pineapple come full circle around a mild resinous hop bitterness with a slight sweetness. Very tasty, well rounded, and drinkable!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
3875,"2014-10-24",3.7,"2014 Darkness Eve at Stubs. Low carbonation. Big hop aroma from this beer. Bitter hops blended well woth moderately sweet malt, but tons of hop flavor. I assume this was the Surly version considering the date and location.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3875,"2014-10-24",3.7,"October 24, 2014 - on tap Darkness Eve at Stubs. Clear golden pour with limited head. Aroma and taste of malt and citrus hops. Nicely balanced and easy to drink.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
3875,"2014-09-28",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2015 On draft at ABR 2014 under the label Axe-Man Unplugged - perhaps there should be a new entry? Not sure. Regardless, this was legit. Light yellow pour, slightly hazy. White head. Huge hoppy nose. Big citrus hop bomb. Low carbonation (coming out of a firkin). Excellent.

Edit: pour from a can, about 11 months after my first review. Holy heck is this an excellent beer, easily the best hoppy beer made by Surly - probably in the Midwest.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"

3875,"2014-09-24",4.5,"I received two 10 oz. pours of this beer, consumed side by side, at the brewerys taproom. The first I sniffed and sipped was a cask version dry-hopped with Mosaic. The second was the standard tap version. I consumed approximately half of the cask version before moving on to the standard tap version, of which I also consumed half, and then I took sips of either as I pleased. As always, I dislike the dulling effects of the cask on aroma, flavor, and, especially, palate, although I do admit the cask can often produce an appealing appearance. First I will review the cask / dry-hopped version, and then I will move on to the standard (and superior) standard tap version. My numeric rating is based on the standard tap version. Cask (dry-hopped with Mosaic): Pours a clear gold with a large amount of long-lasting, frothy, cream-colored head. Produces excellent, long-lasting lacing. Looks great! Very strong, hoppy aroma features scents of pine, armpit / gym bag, and citrus. Nice, mineral-y, tangy flavor. Lemon and lemon peel. Really pleasant taste albeit dulled by the cask, but quite good despite the cask drag. Dry, mineral-y aftertaste. Soft and undercarbonated in a typically bad cask palate. This is a truly excellent beer in taste and aroma, overcoming the negative cask effects like a champion, and it looks superb. 8/5/9/2/17=>4.1 for the dry-hopped cask version. Standard tap: Pours a hazy gold with a small amount of beige head. Fine but ordinary appearance. Beautiful, floral, creamy, piney aroma. Lovely, dry smell features scents of vanilla, rose, orange, dust, and a bit of sweat. Complex, sophisticated, wonderful taste fits perfectly with the aroma and features flavors of lemon, rocks, cream, vanilla, melon, and honey. Piney, dusty, and delicious. Interesting finish reminds me of orange-flavored Flintstones vitamins (and thats a compliment; I used to love those things). Medium body. Lively in the palate with that patented Surly softness. Very good palate effects. Surlys version of Todd the Axe Man is ridiculously delicious and excellent. It is simultaneously pleasant and biting. The imbibing experience evokes a fast ride in a convertible sports car through a beautiful meadow on a perfect sunny day. I cant remember the last time I had a better tasting beer. I really hope Surly makes this again. I honestly could see this garnering Heady Topper or Zombie Dust-esque buzz if Surly canned it. Surly brews a lot of truly great beers in the IPA family, including Furious, Overrated, Abrasive, and Wet. I honestly think this is the best yet. This is a world-class IPA begging to be savored. Go way out of your way to try Surlys Todd the Axe Man; you wont be disappointed! 9/3/10/4/19=>4.5 for the standard tap version.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3875,"2014-09-24",4.4,"Tap. Medium clear yellow pour, light carbonation and a vibrant fruity hop aroma. Flavor was incredible, almost no malt profile, but plenty of slightly sweet and very tropical hops that lasted well after you finished each sip. Really damn good.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
3875,"2014-09-24",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2015 Tap. Bright golden orange pour with a spotty white head. Bright citrus, assertive hop bite. Well balanced. Excellent. Spectacular, actually. One of my all time favorite IPAs, and one of those ""desert island"" type beers.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
3875,"2014-09-21",4.2,"Draft at Surlyfest. Pours a vibrant yellow/orange with billowy white head. Aroma is diesel onion hops-mosaic rules this school. Citrusy, mosaic diesel onion taste. Pretty much the perfect combination for me. Very good but very bitter.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
