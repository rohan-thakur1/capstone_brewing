Flavor is juicy sourish, citrus. Medium bodied. Lomg finish, juicy, resinous, moderate bitter. Good herbal and resinous burp. Lovely stuff.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","PotjeBier"
3865,"2017-05-08",4.2,"This was from a 16 can sent to me by my Grandson Nick. It poured a cloudy golden orange with robust and foamy white head. Nose is tropical fruit with pineapple, mango, guava and stone fruits like apricot and peach. Very intense. Medium plus body with a resinous mouthfeel and some earthiness. The flavor is as intense as the aroma with the pineapple still leading the charge and citrus appears aa well. All the other aromas show up as flavors as well and there is remarkably good balance for a beer so intense. There are a lot of hops here and the finish finally brings some pine bitterness and all that earthiness you get with Mosiac hops. Fantastic IPA.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
3865,"2017-03-05",3.8,"Very hazy, light golden color. Frothy white head. Stonefruit, mango with nice biscuity malt backbone. Very well integrated between hop and malt. Modestly bitter. This beer is about four months old, so hops have faded a lot, but great mouth feel. Lingering white grapefruit in the finish. Very nice","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

3865,"2016-12-27",4.2,"Can care of Joe, Thanks brah. Pours a murky orange golden with massive white and lasting foamy head. Smell is insane with juicy peach, guava, pineapple and all other types of tropical hop resins. Also get some of the english yeast especially as she warms a bit. Flavor is a lot of the same but maybe a touch sweet for my liking. Prob just the fact its close to 7. Theres a fair bit of pine, skunky orange, and grape resin with some light cheese. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a creamy and hoppy finish. Really nice stuff from Moonraker, will have to check these dudes out soon.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3865,"2016-12-19",4.2,"Can from a trade poured into a taster showing hazy whitish yellow with half a finger of clean white foam. 

The nose shows dank and pungent cannabis. 

The palate is medium bodied with moderate to full carbonation but smooth. Strong flavors of dank cannabis with hints of pineapple and a light malt sweetness throughout. Light but sharp IPA bitterness on the finish. Very well done NE style IPA from the west coast.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

Thanks, Chad!

Was lucky enough to receive one of these bad boys and a bunch of others from Chad. Was probably looking forward to this one more than any of the five. He was raving about this place in a recent stop and reading the can it just sounded good, so summarize pungent, juicy and tropical. Cant wait to try it.

Poured a medium yellow-to-straw/gold yellow hazy color with 2-to-3 fingers of frothy white head. Some light bubbles coming up on the sides of the glass. World-class circular lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled Simcoe, Galaxy, Citra, orange blossom, peach, apricot, nectarine, hints of mango, cantaloupe and a touch of Mosaic late. (Smell - 3.75)

Taste was much better than the nose. Very juicy as expected. Got orange juice, peach, cantaloupe, apricot, nectarine, Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy and toned-down Mosaic. Also persimmon, pineapple, orange blossom, orange creamsicle and melons. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, fruity finish. (Feel - 4.25)

Still not a huge fan of the style, but this was one of the better ones. Liked it a lot. Was going back and forth on a few of the ratings, but happy with where it ended up. (Overall - 4.25)

3865,"2016-11-25",4.2,"Can from Sean, five days old. Thanks for sharing! It pours a sunburst yellow color with a white head. The aroma has some canteloupe, watermelon, honeydew and grapefruit. The flavor has a lot of the same. Melon, citrus grapefruit wtih super low bitterness and a creamy mouthfeel. Like a melon smoothie only with a fresh hop kick. Awesome stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3865,"2016-11-23",5.0,"Pours a cloudy, super hazy off-yellow, like a glass of orange juice. Aroma is intense citrus and tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose, intense juiciness, might be the fruitiest IPA Ive ever tried in my life. Just enough bitterness to balance out the fruitiness, absolutely crushable beer. I can honestly say this is, hands down, the best IPA Ive had in my life. As a west coast guy, Ive yet to have the opportunity to try the NE IPAs, so to have guys pumping out the style in my own backyard is absolutely amazing. Expect to hear about these guys a lot more very soon.","Sacramento, California, USA","Brandon101214"

3865,"2016-11-06",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2017 Quite a treat. Unfiltered hazy glass of sunshine that looks like orange juice. Juicy Valencia oranges and pineapple aromas. Smooth body on the taste with a soft resin hop bite and a delicious citrus tropical infusion.","","PugUglyBrewer"

3865,"2016-10-07",4.1,"16 oz can from beerboxer. Pours cloudy gold with a pretty white head and a fruity aroma. There is a rich pale malt flavor that reflects an excellent hop profile. Juicy, fruity and earthy with a nice bitter finish. Well made.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"

3865,"2016-09-22",4.5,"Big tropical pungent aromas. Slightly hazy orange washed out with lasting white head. Smooth sweet juicy carried hops in a thick body. Lasting almost licorice bite finish.","truckee, California, USA","krumbum"
3865,"2016-08-23",4.3,"Yeah buddy - fantastic hazy juicy ass ipa. All kinds of crushable - tropical and juicy citrus bomb of a nose with flavor to match. This could rival several of the top rated east coasters.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3865,"2016-06-28",4.5,"The first things I noticed were the overwhelming citrus smell and the cloudy, mimosa look. A light, crisp flavor made it perfect on a hot day. This beer has a lot to it, but blends them all perfectly.","California, USA","CakeWolf"
3865,"2016-05-21",4.1,"750 ml growler. Thanks, snuffy. The beer is a glowy yellow-tannish orange color. Its completely clouded through and looks heavy with unfiltered goodness. Smallish white head, a bit soapy, but it is a growler pour. The aroma is wonderfully juicy, full of fruity hop flavor. Big tropical flavor with sweet stone fruit and citrus. Pineapple, peach, tangerine, melon, kiwi, lime. Really, really nice, particularly as it warms up and more flavor emerges. Nice mineral/yeast note. Full and juicy taste. Brimming with more of those fruity hop flavors. Mild bitterness. I could understand wanting a smidge more, but I like it. Fair bit of astringency, which I really like in these New England-style/English yeast IPAs. Reminds me of some Hoof Hearted beers. I would love to see this brewery make more beers like this and see them in cans.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
