Im fairly new to specialty beer, but this one satisfies my preferences in alcoholic beverages across the board. I enjoy Syrah and Sauvignon Blanc wines; full-bodied bourbons; and stout and Belgian influenced beer. Its like a perfectly blended mixture of all of these and is my current favorite.","Anderson, South Carolina, USA","daiverson"

While being approachable and very drinkable, it lacks complexity. Instead of 8 weeks, it really shouldve stayed in bourbon barrels for 8 months.

It pours a golden-orange color, leaving a mid-sized creamy head that leaves behind a gorgeous Belgian lace. The aroma is of a tantalizing Belgium-meets-Kentucky essence, making one very curious to discover what Curieux tastes like on the tongue. And how does it taste? Luscious!!! There is a creamy texture to it that lingers on the tongue. You taste a smokiness from the bourbon barrel aging and the exquisite harmony and balance of the malt and hops of this tripel from what has been one of the best (perhaps THE best) brewer of Belgian beers outside of Belgium. I feel like I am drinking an Old Fashioned made with high-end bourbon and at the same time Im drinking a Duvel-level brew. I taste white pepper, coconut, blood orange, butter-and-brown-suga- glazed bananas with pecans, and a lingering oaky tobacco smokiness -- all hitting my tastebuds in the right degree.

Tastes the same with the addition of red kuri squash/nutmeg, bourbon oak, sun-dried multigrain chips, banana peppers, farmhouse yeast, and pilsner malt.

3251,"2014-06-01",3.7,"I split a 750ml bottle with a friend. We each poured it into tulip glasses. It was bottled on 1/24/14 (thanks to Renee for the bottle!).

Appearance: Glowing orange hue. Mostly cloudy with some visible carbonation. Pours to a large, beige, foamy head which retains and laces fairly well.

Smell: Strong bourbon and alcohol/phenolic character. Definite Belgian yeast esters as well.

Taste: Im a big fan of Belgian-style Tripels, though Ive never had one that was aged in bourbon barrels as is the case of Allagash Curieux. Barrel-aging can be a wonderful addition to a strong stout or barleywine, though Im not sure its ideal for a Tripel. Theres a constant back-and-forth between the base brew and the bourbon character from the Jim Beam barrels. An interesting contrast between banana, clove and raw malt against an astringent, earthy character of wood and vanilla. Theres distinct crushed black pepper in the palate here, too. A consistent presence of dry, tingly spiciness. The alcohol also comprises a major flavor component which has a slightly buttery taste with strong heat and dryness on the finish. Id probably prefer the regular Allagash Tripel to this, though Curieux is certainly interesting to say the least.

Drinkability: It probably goes without saying that a big 11% ABV Belgian-style Tripel aged in bourbon barrels is going to be a full-bodied brew in every way possible. Theres plenty of effervescence initially, though it does calm down to a soft mouthfeel with a creamy texture. Its difficult to drink Allagash Curieux in more than a sip at a time, though a beer like this is best enjoyed via a slow, savory delivery anyway.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3251,"2014-02-07",4.0,"75cL bottle poured into a goblet. A barrel aged tripel ... this one had me curieux ... sorry about that =). I spent quite awhile diving into the aroma on this one. Theres the banana, clove, and doughy smells one might typically expect from a tripel, but then, in equal portions theres a strong bourbon, wood, and seltzer water smell up front. The bourbon, wood and seltzer fade though by the time your into the first couple sips. This is replaced by a faint buttery caramel note with biscuits and even a bit of nuttiness. Its a golden-yellow beer (starts clear, but becomes hazy by mid bottle) with a beautiful creamy white head that retains throughout and leaves an abundant coating of lace around the glass. Its a good balance between a roasted bitterness and grape sweetness with maybe a very mellow touch of sour. Its a relatively light body for a tripel - probably a medium body in the grand scheme of things - with a creamy, yet light texture (if that makes sense) - the soft, but abundant, carbonation really helps out in this regard. The tongue is greeted by bready, doughy notes with some sour grape sweet/sour flavors. A roasty, but sweet, bourbon flavor rushes in shortly thereafter to dominate the palate for a while and warm the swallow quite nicely. The roasted bourbon quality (is that redundant?) sticks around and makes an appearance in the aftertaste too, but this turns slightly burnt and more like sweet caramel with a touch of astringency. The aftertaste lingers for awhile and evolves into an umami-like cheesiness with some nut-like tastes and a very faint hint of metallic (but nothing off-putting)","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Pours a hazy yellow with a creamy head of bone white foam that fell luxuriously to a thick ring and left plenty of handsome lace. Body of the beer glows with promise and is the soft pastel color of golden sunshine. 

Nose is the definition of complex. Its sublime with bourbon, oak and tropical fruit to tempt. Theres a tartness and some mild yeast with a slight breath of alcohol. Picks up some earth as it warms and a touch of pepper. Light banana and clove emerge with a touch of vanilla. 

Taste follows the nose and unfolds like a symphony. The ripe fruit is sticky and sweet. Almost candied. The bourbon lays quietly underneath oaky and deep. The alcohol warmth and the pepper bring out the fruits so well. The woody quality and the vanilla accents the malt which is smooth and long and has earthy tones as well. The honey sweetness of the malt and the and the bourbon create a sensual mouthfeel that is strong and a little heavier than the usual tripel. The bourbon lingers int he aftertaste with a hint of smoke and the candied fruit. 

This beer continued to unfold throughout the drink and the fruits were varied and splendid. Pear, pineapple, apple, orange, apricot, mango. At one point I beheld coconut. There was a slight sour that gave an immense drinkablility to all the rich sweetness. The buttery smooth malt and the rich bourbon were the perfect compliment and added a depth that resounded. Lingered a touch hot in the aftertaste like bourbon and like sweet  candy.

Its taste was a good sweet fruity and floral blend with some citrus notes, a touch of sour, and notes of pine, candy, and oak.  It had a lively, fizzy body, and was somewhat wet, with a full mouthfeel and average carbonation.  Thanks for sharing, Eric.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

3251,"2013-01-30",3.5,"2013.01.30 - Allagash Curieux - 750ml bottle in goblet glass.  Bottle marked ""Bottling September 2011"".  I've had this bottle for over a year and never felt in the mood to drink it.

Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow.  White head is fed by moderate carbonation but disappears pretty quickly.  A white rig around the edge persists.

Aroma is pretty bland to me.  As it warms I feel like I can get some I whiffs of booziness.

Mouthfeel is pretty light.  Carbonation seems right on the money to me.

Taste is nice.  Sweetness on the front end, spicy and perhaps a bit bitter on the back.  Just the faintest alcohol warmth.  Alcohol well hidden for 11%.  This may be a great representation of Tripels but I'm not much a a fan of the style to make such a judgement.  This is one of the better Tripels I've had, for what that's worth.   Probably not worth the price of entry (to me), though I do not recall the purchase price.   To my limited knowledge/taste: no banana ester such as Merry Monks, plus a nice boozy warmth from the barrel aging.  Underlying taste is vaguely in the ballpark of Weyerbacher Seventeen, with pepper replaced by alcohol warmth.

3251,"2013-01-22",3.7,"Reviewed 1/6/2013. Portion of a 750mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a cloudy light gold color betraying strong carbonation behind the hazy body. The head is a one finger white shade that retains itself nicely for 11%. Also, it never fully fades away.

S: The bourbon influence is moderate here. It really comes across as oaky more than anything, though you do get subtle vanilla and coconut qualities in the aroma. The tripel qualities that pop up are very neutral - not really sweet, but not bitter smelling, either.

T: Sweeter than the aroma. The base tripel comes through more strongly here, as well. Initially, theres a neutral oaky tannin quality (which pops up in the finish as well), while most of the tripel flavors appear in the midtaste. Tons of candied sugar occupy the aforementioned middle of the palate. Finish is a combination of bread-like malt, spicy yeast, and oak tannins, while the bourbon contributes a subtle presence throughout. Im amazed how well the booze is hidden given its dryness. While that disappointingly doesnt give it the dangerous drinkability it could have, it really gives it a sense of finesse. Sure, a sliiight heat is evident, but this isnt hot at all - if you told me this was 7%, I would have believed you completely.

M: A bit heavy and sweet - but when the booze is hidden this well, it doesnt really matter. Dry at first, but the syrupy nature builds up after a while. Healthy carbonation tries to aid drinkability some, but the thick, sweet flavor renders this a slow sipper.

O: I dont know if its better than La Fin Du Monde, but its really damn good regardless. The booze is hidden (almost) so brilliantly I cant help but applaud - especially given its BA roots. Is it worth $18-20? Not really, there isnt quite enough Holy Shit Quotient in the flavors here. Then again, Im not a massive fan of the style. Having said that, its an excellent choice for those who love tripels and bourbon barrel aging.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

The aroma is earthy and fruity with a mild woodiness & some honey. It really doesnt smell very bourbon-y at all. 

The flavor is fruity and kind of funky at first, there is a a mild bitterness all around, I swear I couldnt pick up any bourbon-y flavors on the first few sips, but man once I noticed it the bourbon character became far more dominant, plenty of woodiness, vanilla, light booziness.

3251,"2011-10-29",4.3,"I got to try this beer on tap and out of the bottle.  This was poured on draft into a footed tulip glass.  The beer carries fruity aromas of pineapple, candied peaches, musky oak and buttered popcorn.  On the palate, it is appetizingly sweet and creamy with some oaky pear, peach, candied tropical fruit and some taffy.  Sipping this beer is like drinking a very good, unprocessed fruit juice (among other things).  This is an adequately complex beer to begin with, but the barrel rounds out the fruity flavors in the beer and wraps them in an oaky, candylike coating which contributes to its sophisticated nature.  First class!","Pennsylvania, USA","bosendorfer"

I feel like that represents the flavor profile as well - it doesnt feel quite balanced, but it feels like a great beer, overall. Perhaps with some age...

The flavor one complex brew changes drastically as the beer warms. New layers become apparent as you allow the temperature to take effect.

I find that as you swallow the beer it leaves a very nice vanilla flavor, with a strong bourbon aftertaste.  I find that Curiex is more flavorful when it is closer to room temperature.

Nose is strong and malty with generous bready and sweet fruit aromas, along with some alcohol. Bourbon barrel aging is immediately evident in the flavor, and its too much of a whiskey taste (there is nothing subtle about it). The tripel qualities of fruit and wheat are overwhelmed by the wood. Backside is a little nutty and boozy. I love good beer and I love bourbon, but this is not a good combination. Perhaps the 8 weeks of aging should be cut to two to keep the whiskey to a flirting hint in the taste and not a punch in the face.","Washington DC, USA","caralkaline87"

A medium body of delicate complexity that unravels into a palatable array of flavors: bourbon whiskey, vanilla, creamy watermelon, cantaloupe, pepper, hints of clove and a nicely rounded boozy warmth.  The finish is very dry with a lingering of straight  bourbon and vanilla.  A very curious beer that is a little too doused in bourbon for my taste.

So there are the fruit flavors really taking second whistle to the oak-aged aspects (in my opinion). This is a unique combination for a beer and I am not positive that it works that well. Ive had other oak-aged beers and they are generally of the darker variety. I must say that some of those I think are hard to drink because of the whiskey flavors, whereas this one is somewhat more manageable. You get the fruit and the yeast here, but for me its mostly an exercise in oaking. There is a synthesis, but I dont think I would want to drink it again, even if I enjoyed it the first time around.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"

Pours a lift caramel color that is somewhat opaque. Nose brings forward a god dose of light bourbon along with some caramel sweetness and bread. Sligt spicing. The taste just doesnt really work for me, with some strange bread and banana interacting with the bourbon. It sounds good, but just isnt very appetizig to me. Mouthfeel is a bit boozy and thin.

Nose is light bourbon, with traces of banana, confectionary, spice, white pepper, lemon drops, fresh cream, vanilla, smells like a bourbon/lemon meringue pie. It smells like baked goods and brown liquor even more strongly than my grandmother!!! Bourbon comes out to play much more strongly on the palate, with the citrus and spice still present, but rather behind the vanilla/toast/corn whiskey notes. Nice balance between citrus/candy sweetness, and bourbon sourness. Well balanced, but I feel the prettier floral/confectionary  notes are as masked by the bourbon in the mouth as they are accentuated by the borubin in the nose. A double-edged sword. Still a very nice beer. Ive had a few barrel-aged Tripels, but those were soured by and large. This an interesting beer, perhaps not one Id pay $20 for again, but very pretty, and yet with the bourbon very masculine. This beer walks a razors edge, and is generally succesful at it.

3251,"2011-01-04",4.0,"Hazed apple juice color with a big fluffy white head that settles down pretty quickly. The aroma takes a bit more time to grasp. I initially get some fruity aspects from orange and lemon peel, with a sugared candy (cherry?) backing. Eventually as I warm up to the beer I get sweet vanilla bean from the bourbon barrels peaking through. This is a peculiar beer that takes some time understanding. Like the smell, the taste first offers a sweet tangy flavor, kind of syrupy. I am wondering where the Bourbon is. Then about half way through as the beer warms up, the Bourbon comes out of no where and dominates the palate. With a complexity of different flavors coming into play, Curieux feels like a delicate sipper, very warming as bourbon and vanilla give rise. I really enjoy the woody essence the barrels give off to interplay with the malts and spicy yeast flavor.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

Pour was the color of watery black tea; a golden yellow with a hint of light brown. There was a small white head that quickly dissipated into itself and disappeared. Great amount of carbonation in this one. The nose was the usual tripel suspects; banana and clove mixed with bourbon (light hints), a little vanilla and oak as well. The taste is spectacular for a tripel. A wonderful banana and clove taste hits the tongue followed by the slight heat of alcohol, an almost burnt sugar taste, hints of bourbon, and vanilla as well as oak. I love that there is no bubble gum or peppery notes in this tripel. A complex beer that I will surely have to cellar every year.

3251,"2010-04-22",4.3,"Thanks to DLucky for the opportunity to try this one! November 2007 batch poured into my Mad Elf Chalice.

A- Body is a very cloudy straw yellow color that pours with a 1 finger foamy white head. Head eventually fades to a thin collar but plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass. Cloudiness is thick and dynamic.

S-Nose is mild and balanced. Characters noted are a subtle floral hoppiness, a hint of sugary (perhaps bourbon) sweetness, oak woodiness, and alcohol astringency.

T- The presence of oak, floral hops, apples, and sugary sweetness mix up front with a subtle presence of spicy yeast and bourbon in the background. A hint of alcohol astringency and warmth comes through for the finish, which is rather clean and dry.

P- Low to medium carbonation and a smooth yeasty body with a hint of alcohol presence.

O- This is a wonderful, dry, classy beer. I am impressed that the oak and bourbon are such notable characteristics of this brew. It was a great opportunity to try this and the 11% seems more like 8%...which gets to be a little much for one person. Great brew that I would love to have again overall.

Brilliant oranges and ambers shimmer under a soft haze of pithy foam. A steady stream of carbonation lazes its way up to the surface where they release a spiced wooden bourbon assault unto my nose; Im not complaining. Spice, wood, and bourbon warms from my tippy-toe to the tippy-top of my head. Boozy mango and oranges with skin soak in every last ounce of bourbon while marmalade, cinnamon sticks, and nutmeg compliment a dry woody nose. Whole coconuts sweet and earthy at the same time round the corner into raw honeycomb. Delightfully dry, spiced, and wholly bourbon, I lick wet lips and dive right on in. A thick mouthfeel sticks to the roof of my mouth and all porous surfaces, opening the way for bourbon to soak me to the bone. Amazingly she manages to be sweet, dry with wood and spice, and warm with bourbon all at the same time. Warmth immediately fills the back of my throat while mangos, oranges, and fresh chunks of coconut steep in a bourbon bath. Raw cinnamon sticks and nutmeg are scattered throughout while raw honeycomb sticks to my lips with each quaff; most detectable as a subtle undercurrent, she carries me through each quaff right back to the beginning and back again. Not overly complex but very tasty, the Allagash Curieux was a warm bourbon delight from start to finish. Its amazing how the time spent in the Jim Beam barrels changed the original character of their Tripel.


Why choose between one or the other when you can have both. A limited seasonal release, grab a bottle or two of Curieux while you can, and if you really wanted to have some fun, do a side-by-side comparison of the Allagash Tripel and the Allagash Curieux.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3251,"2009-12-29",4.0,"On tap at Dilly Deli in Cincinnati. Pours a cloudy golden orange with a rocky white head. Aroma is nicely sweet, a blend of sweet  bread, fruitness and some vanilla. Just a bit of spiciness is apparent along with some yeast. Flavor starts sweet and fruity before gaining a bit of barnyard. Gets just lightly tart along with a more pronounced citric character leading to a crisp but smooth finish and an awesome lingering bourbon almond taste. Medium rich body and a soft carbonation.

The apple sweetness still exists, but I get much more spicy yeast, bourbon, honey, and a very dry, woody finish.

Flavors of oak, honey flavored wax, grains, vinous chardonnay notes which is odd because this was aged in Jim Beam barrels and not wine barrels.

The nose is full of fruits, light bread notes, yeast, alcohol and bourbon.  The body is generally smooth, but the flavors beg you to carefullly sip.  The flavors are very strong and upfront.  I tasted notes of orange peel, bread, yeast, alcohol, light floral hops and grass.  The flavor I enjoyed the most, though, was the bourbon toward the back end and in the finish of the beer.  The bourbon mixed in really well with the other flavors, even bringing out some of the fruit notes.  One of the fruit notes that was really brought out was the oranges.

3251,"2009-04-29",3.8,"From a 750mL Bottle, December 04 Vintage.  Mostly transparent, golden yellow colored pour with a tall layer of well sustaining, fizzy white head.  Estery aromas of lemon rind and bready malt spiced with some mild, earthy pepper.  The bourbon characters lurk sufficiently behind the base beer, emitting vanilla tones while cold (40F), becomming increasingly boozy and brashingly oaky as it warms.  Pear esters add a soft, soothing contrast to the bourbon.  Medium-light bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, malty texture.  The body is nice and light, but has a texture that indicates a high starting gravity.  Bready malt and pear ester flavors up front on the palate, followed by a white pepper brightness.  Starts to warm a bit in the middle, with some vanilla tones softening up the spiciness of the alcohol.  Finishes rather bourbony, and increasingly so as it warms, with a grainy, oak tannin harshness lingering in the finish.  The tripel character is pleasantly evident beneath the barrel traits, but I find the bourbon (as opposed to the straight up oak) aspects to be slightly over whelming.  Still, in all regards, this is a well executed, enjoyable beer.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Im having a hard time picking out any barrel characteristics, some vanilla is about it.  Finishes sweet with a touch of bitterness.

On the finish, the bourbon notes finally come in for me.  There’s just a hint of sweet woody flavor that gives this one a great finish. 

Solid all around beer, a real standout from Allagash.","New York, New York, USA","nramsburg"

The scent turned out to be a great indication of the taste and overall mouth feel.  It has a sweet mild smell of alcohol.  The flavor is just so gentle.  A nice medium body with some sweetness.  You can sort of tell the alcohol is present but it really does not hit until the end of the sip when a slight woody bourbon flavor kicks in.  Just a terrific smooth warmer.","West Bloomfield, Michigan, USA","gearbike"

The oak aroma carries over to the the flavor , adding to a honey sweetness that continues into the finish. Enough bitterness for some balance, but hops are certainly not a prominent feature here. Lightly carbonated, with a light to medium body, smooth, and surprisingly clean considering the sweetness that is up front.

3251,"2008-11-20",4.1,"Bottle into chalice. Pours hazy light orange-gold, with a creamy white head and nice, solid lacing. Nose  hints of bourbon and vanilla, slight booziness, meld with sweet apricot and passion fruit, with just a bit of yeast. Vanilla really comes through as a nice, smooth vanilla sweetness, apricots dipped in cream with a slightly boozy aspect. 
Taste  Begins with an underlying note of vanilla, moves to a much larger, more prominent bourbon note to complement a nice, sweet apricot presence with just a hint of dryness. Finish is yeasty, dry, a bit more bourbon comes through. Really a fantastic balance between the barrel and the beer. Really top notch, one of my favorite Allagash experiences. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a soft, fluffy carbonation.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","JohnQPublic"

The flavor pale malts and orangey notes at the core surrounded by spicy, peppery bourbon, vanilla, and toasted oak.. finished on the sweeter end, but still well-balanced.

The aroma shows notes of banana nut bread, caramel, Kentucky bourbon, honey, fruity esters, and doughy yeast.   The flavor is somewhat of a conundrum.  Just the concept of a Belgian tripel aged in bourbon barrels is foreign to me, but this works exceptionally well.  The bready yeast and sweet fruity notes work surprisingly well with the malty, sour mash bourbon.  Nutty and fruity up front, with a lightly sour, pungent finish.  Medium-full and smooth bodied, there is a bit of stickiness and alcoholic heat, but that can be forgiven.

3251,"2008-07-22",3.7,"750 ml bottle from bev4less. Pours a hazy dark gold color with a medium sized foamy white head. The aroma is moderate in strength with whiffs of bourbon, sweet Belgian yeasts,  some red fruits and dough. The flavor features bourbon, but it is not a strong in your face bourbon, its a mellow subtle bourbon tease. Also present in the taste is bread dough, vanilla and oak. The mouthfeel is full and malty. The finish is rather short and dry. Overall: I’ve noticed that bourbon barrel aged beers fall into two categories: one, they are overpowering with whiskey and just a hint of beer character is present; or two, there is just hint of whiskey with a good beer character. This beer falls into the later category. And, because of that it tends to remind me of a cheap watered down bourbon more than anything else.

Nose contains a good bit of oak, also plenty of honeyish sweetness, the bourbon present here as well along with some toasted malt notes and dried flowers.

Flavor profile is a nice blend of fruity sweetness and honeyed oak, some melon and white grape, finishing with stronger notes of bourbon and oak tannins, bitterness is fairly minimized overall by this point in time.  Some faint, lingering peppery alcoholic fire.  Mouthfeel is low in effervescence and lightly syrupy, body is of course quite full.

The aroma is bright and fruity with apple, citruses (lemon), honey, oak, various spices and yeast is evident. Great chewy body with lively carbonation. Has lots of layers of flavors. The fruits range from pears, green apple, lemon. Theres a nice sweet Belgian malt back, which is graham cracker-like, with tons of peppery spiciness to balance. The alcohol is very well hidden in the flavor, yet it still has a nice warming character. There is the bourbon-oak present, yet its subtle and comes through more as it warms. The finish is nice and has a flowery dryness with prolonged spiciness that helps balance the sweet fruitiness and rich body. A very nice Tripel.","Vista, California, USA","bsierra"

3251,"2008-04-29",3.0,"750ml bottle poured into a Trappist glass.  AC pours similiar to the color of grapefruit juice but with a touch of pink and it is hazy.  The head is small, fine and settles quickly.  The aroma is a mix of citrus and peach juice.  When you get closer to the beer there is a moderate, well-blended aroma of bourbon.  The bourbon makes a light to moderate presense in the taste.  It is just enough to make this a very unique tripel.  The citrus acid flavors dont mix with the bourbon as well as Id like.  I think that idea -almost- works but misses by an RCH.  The alcohol presense was moderate adding to the feel of the general heaviness of the beer.

Flavor is extremely well balanced.  Many barrel aged beers have way to much oak, alcohol or something else to be tasty.  This been had only a mild oak, bourbon and vanilla flavor.  The abbey tripel portion of the beer was still relevant, with slight malt, fruity esters and Belgian candy all lurking behind the Jim Beam flavors.  Finish was slightly sticky and a little dry.  I have not had this from the bottle, but I have to imagine this beer was meant to be on cask.

Pours a shimmering gold color with a fluffy white head of 3 fingers. The Duvel tulip that houses this beer maintains a foamy cap of head and is marred by dense lacing.

Aroma is very yeasty, with a distinct woody hard liquor note and some tropical fruitiness.

The bourbon barrel influence on the flavor is unmistakeable. There is a breathtaking oaky vanilla booze bite in the middle of the palate that just melts into a fruity sweetness that finishes pleasantly dry. The warmth in the chest imparted by this beer is trademark whiskey, and it blends surprisingly well with the sweet tripel notes of pear and orange.

Mouthfeel is wonderful, with a quite Belgian carbonation and a nice dry finish for such a sweet and rich beer.

3251,"2008-01-20",4.6,"750ml corked&caged bottle, dated November 2007. Pours very cloudy, brownish orange with gold and caramel highlights. The head rouses slowly into a thick, cloudy, off-white foam that quickly fades into a very thin ring of foam. The aroma is thick and complex, full of fruit and yeast. There are lots of fruity esters - particularly banana. There are also notes of spice, of caramel, and of alcohol. The bready, doughy yeast is a very attractive component of the aroma, too. As the beer warms, a boozy smell of bourbon comes into the fold. The flavor is solid - what a fantastic tripel this is! Lots of fresh-baked-bread-doughy goodness with lots of funky, Belgian-y esters. And its really smooth, too - no flavor is intense or overwhelming. Instead it is a soft, harmonious symphony. In the middle of the tongue, the flavor grows more complex with some spice from the yeast  and a touch of wood and vanilla. The back of the palate picks up some more spicy esters as well as a soft, balancing level of noble hops. The back of the palate detects a decent bit of alcohol which results in a slightly boozy finish. It has a subtle taste of sweet bourbon, too, that strengthens as the beer slowly warms in the snifter. The finish is also quite dry and spicy. It is slightly warming on the back of the throat thanks to the dollop of ethanol. Despite some of the boozy flavors, I think this beer hides its strength incredibly well. The mouthfeel is very creamy and light (medium in body - which is quite light for such a strong ale). It is amazingly drinkable. This is the kind of beer that could get one into serious trouble (luckily I only have one, and Im splitting it with my wife, so the amount of trouble I could get into is quite limited). Overall, a fantastic tripel that is made even more beautiful through the subtle and sublime flavors from its aging in oak whiskey barrels.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Pours a rich macro gold with a big rocky head.  Big ass sweetness.  Round malt with a slightly grapey Belgian flavor (Allagash house yeast strain?).  Oaky vanilla in the mix for sure.  Bourbon is subtle and complementary to the tripelness, particularly lending some caramel notes. Subdued carbonation in a relatively thin but not watery beer.   Big sweet oaky beer over a lightly caramelly sweet malty tripel with that vinous twinge.  Very tannic and oaky with small cherry.  Caramel seems to really pop out of the tripel by bourbon barrel interaction... lovely!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Strong aromas of sourdough, stonefruit nectar, green apples, and vanilla. Full nectar weight with ample residual effers although very soft for that proprietary Allegash creamy texture. A solid malt body balanced perfectly by a persistant peachpit bittering component and spicey bourbon. I totally pickup on the cinnamon nuances of the Bourbon influence. This brew is as complex as it gets and only mildly sweet. Creamy bitter apple, stonefruit  nectar, banana, kiwi, citrus, caramel, vanilla, clove, potato, asparagus, and vodka. The finish is strong and lingering with a fruity, boozey warmth. Overall: This is a very generous brew. Strong fruit and  defined booze create a rich and warming sensation.

3251,"2007-10-26",3.8,"Bottled, 2007 Ed.  Cloudy, golden body with sparkling lines of bubbles--like champaign--and topped with a small-but-tenacious white head that leaves behind delicate lace in the form of rounded spots, irregular streaks, splotches, and sometimes these are connected.  The mouth is fullish (despite a lighter body) with an incredible amount of creamy, foamy carbonation and a somewhat wet finish.  The oak barrels dominate the aroma, giving it the smell of wine, while the beer itself is somewhat fruity and alcoholic with lemon, whey, and probably some other things.  The taste is coying and fruity with lots of sugar, white wine, and a sour finish of oak, citrus, green grapes, and an alcoholic tone of what Im assuming must be the bourbon.  As it warms, there is a touch of whiskey on the aroma.  Warming and strong; tastes like wine, and the good news is that it doesnt give me a terrible headache like wine does.  Goes down easy; alcohol is powerful but well-blended; refreshing, with a long-lasting, sour finish.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"
3251,"2007-10-24",4.4,"A perfect gleam of sunlit, clear chilled lemony yellow. Until the end has reached the bottle and it gets all opaque from the yeast and looks like a gorgeous plastic mold of lemon ochre. Starchy, weakened, plummeting capping of off-white, loose foam creates the roofing. A settled dense, bubbly foam is left at the edges to collar the top like soft ice cream pushed up from a spoon. Inky drawn out lacing splats across the glass with a light embrace. 

Softly delicate, lush, and inviting nose of plump citrusy juices, soured candied sugars, and some semi sharp white grapey wine-likeness sweeps to the front on every wiff. Smells much like a fine Italian lemon sorbet. 

Taste is vibrant, full, and seeping with a long lasting heated touch of bourbonyness soaked into every inch of the citrusy Tripel ale envelope. Sealed with many malty edges, this sucker gets right in there and makes itself welcome in your soul. Wonderfully pungent and yet soft and delicate in nature along the path of its bittering citrus notes of lemon, orange, pineapple, and tangerine juices, pith, and peels. Perfect malty balance underneath with a semi sweet and tenderly present candy tone. Throw in the always present twinge of bourbony twisted heat and grapey-like flavors and this is one hell of a fun package to open. 

Feel is about medium bodied; closing in on fullish; good malt presence sticks it to you right quick and lets all the little things play their part as it firms up the hold of absolutely fantastic, mildly pungent, citrusy sugars, and fun, take their time to unfold under the heat of a great and grapey bourbony kick. 

The 11% is evident in smell and taste but not really taken into account while consuming as it goes down with ease. That said, the bourbon that is there does hamper a bit of its overall downability. But not enough to really take away from the performance at hand(bottle). A very solid offering from Allagash!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

The mouthfeel is very thin, and thats not normally a plus for me, but the experience is bolstered by that intense alcohol presence and the oak, so Id call it ""delicate but earthy.""

Transparent light gold color with a copious amount of carbonation; not much of a head, only some small white lace. Then after the first few sips, this beer gets more difficult to drink for me.  Extremely strong alcohol is present in the flavor; so much, in fact, that it drowns out most of the elements present in the aroma that I would like to experience. Just a sweet and malty kick at start, then finishing in pungent mouthwash-like alcohol. Decent mouthfeel.

Pineapple seems in there somewhere. Vanilla comes along, and the finish is not quite dry, and a bit astringent. The bitter aspects could be from floral hop.

How: Many tasting sessions
The look:  Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a small white head.
In long:  Barrel apparent on the nose.  Very yeasty beer with fruity notes of pineapples, peach and other juicy light fruits.  Honey sweetness is kept under control considering this is an 11% beer.  Barrel is well integrated and finds its niche without crushing other elements of the beer.   Some (or impression of) salty spices.  Surprising hoppy finale with a medium bitterness.  Alcohol well concealed, I would have guessed 8%.  Its rare that a high abv barrel-aged beer can be called refreshing but its the case here.  Another winner from Allagash.

3251,"2007-08-22",4.0,"Bottled August 2006.  Pours an opaque, golden-orange color with a white, fairly small, fizzy but persistant head and nice but scattered lacing.  Nose is bizarre but interesting; the JB note is apparent first but not overpowering, as if from a cocktail with bourbon.  Other notes of light vanilla, tart lambic-esque notes, honey, light peach, and herbal notes.  Flavor is nice as well but the bourbon flavors are more dominant with a good amount of sweet vanilla.  Underlying notes of honey, light herbal bitterness, light tart peach notes, pepper, and even a coconut tinge as well.  The oaken vanilla really complements the candi sugar notes of the tripel well with other flavors complementing nicely.  Palate is great with a moderately full body, a soft carbonation, and a creamy, velvety texture with just the right amount of dryness from the herbal hops and the oak.  Finishes fairly long and a bit dry with notes of vanilla, yeast, and light herbal (oregano, maybe?) with a lingering bourbon tinge.  An interesting experiment to say the least; the vanilla notes really were accentuated with the other sweet notes and the oak went well with the other complementary flavors.  The bourbon notes were a bit too dominant in the flavor which kept it from being great.  Intriguing and certainly uniquely complex with an excellent palate and no noticable signs of alcohol at 11%.  Not the best tripel Ive had but certainly worth a try just for the uniqueness and innovativeness.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

3251,"2007-08-05",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2007 Bottle aged one year: Luminous golden. Brilliant clarity. Lathery and rocky white froth deposits intricate patches of lace with every sip. Brightly herbal aromatics with notes of plaster, dried pineapple, straw-tinged malt, vanillin, and unripe peaches dusted with black pepper. Touch of minerals. Fluffy and compact carbonation. Impeccably conditioned. Barrel-derived charred sugars clasp the palate and beautifully contrast with the Tripel elements and abundance of dried tropical fruits (coconut, pineapple, mango). Nutty oak and straw-tinged malt lay an extremely soft and clean foundation for the fruity esters which gracefully glide over the palate. Salty tannins awaken the palate and deepen the complexity. Peppery alcohol imparts dryness and bolsters the spicy phenolics, but is masterfully cloaked. Complementary sherry exudes ever so subtly and enhances the chewiness of the well-aged cakey malt, but the oxidation never dulls or tarnishes any of the resounding luster. Succulent fresh peach flavors and textures also help allay the papery oxidation, as do the palate-coating silky-vanilla barrel extractives and plastery yeast character. Sappy residuals interact with the malt sweetness and salty tannins to yield a sumptuous black-licorice effect.  Closes creamy and moistly full with vanilla-infused caramel flavors which linger alongside a well-developed cakey malt fullness and a soft and understated brush of oak.  Flawlessly attenuated. Ive always thought highly of this beer but dont recall it ever being so integrated and nuanced. The year of aging has obviously worked its magic.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Pours a light cloudy amber with a beautiful white head and heavy lacing. Soft aroma of lemon, pear, and honey; maybe a whisper of Jim Beam in there too (at just below cellar temperature; a lot of more it as this warms to room temperature, of course). 

The bourbon doesnt really come in until one reaches the smoothly blended, slightly sour, gently sweet flavor. Even there the bourbon barrel is more an afterthought than an in-your-face display of barrel-aged exotica. (Note: again, this becomes more about the bourbon as it warms, albeit in a gentle way not in a blast-you-with-vanilla-oak-syrup way). Weve got the characteristic light septic funkiness from Allagash, along with some very nice apricots (apricot skins?)  in the finish. The beer starts a bit sticky and prickly on the palate but this too comes into its own with warming and one gets quite a nice creamy beer for 11%.

A wonderful light bodied tripel with just a hint of vanilla and bourbon.  When chilled the initial sip is clean and refreshing as a tripel should be.  On the finish you get that slight touch of vanilla.  As the beer warms the vanilla and bourbon play a bigger role but never get out of balance with a malt profile.  Hops are constrained just to enough fairly neutral bittering hops (perhaps Saaz) to balance the malt.

The head was a beautiful soft white cloud that stayed with the beer till the last sip.

Allagash clearly has its yeast under control unlike many other American breweries that let their Belgian beers go banana/bubblegum/clove.  Additionally they did an amazing job of adding the bourbon barrel character as a layer.  Other craft brewers end up with beers that taste like a poorly made Jack and Coke.

Smell is of tropical fruit salad, leather, peach, oaky vanilla, dough, caramel, and a nice bourbon aroma that is excellent to inhale. There is a warmness found in the aroma but not a hot boozy burn as I seem to remember from the 2004 version.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas and it seems to meld together nicely. This is one of the few Bourbon Barrel Tripels Ive had and I think the peachy, apricot, tropical, doughyness really compliments the bourbony caramel, and vanilla warmness.

Fresh: Pours a beautiful hazy amber that clears somewhat, rather quickly. I almost fell over when the cork came out, Monstrous, almost disastrous bourbon aroma, followed by what seems like a windstorm of peat and brown sugar. I do really enjoy bourbon barrel aged beers and as of yet havent grown tired of this popular trend, especially with belgian style beer. Taste is so bourbon rich I think some must have been added at bottling. Also tastes of caramel, trappist yeast(Westmalle), raspberry or cherry. Finish is long and very warming. Excellent, but oh so young.
20 months: Bourbon has mellowed considerably in aroma and to a lesser extent in the taste, now this beer shines with incredible complexities. Nutty and dried fruit tastes come to the fore after the whisky steps to the side. Awesome.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Reminds me of a chardonnay.  Dries out a little upon the finish due to a light estery yeast, but then comes back to the original flavors, rather than remaining dry.  An oak and sour grape taste remain, with an acidic quality reminiscent of coffee.  Mouthfeel was surprisingly soft, with fairly low carbonation, and medium body.

Highly carbonated, medium body, with warming alcohol presence:  a bit on the dry side.  The aging has much mellowed the bourbon and oak notes.

Sweet, treacly nose full of caramel, coconut, sweet apples, honey, whole grains, fresh dough and luckily, a conspicuous absense of bourbon.  The spicy yeast, fruity esters and lively carbonation are all gone, which takes away a lot from this.  The body is thick and full with little carbonation that leaves a bit of a sweet film in the mouth.  More sweetness in the flavor, with a bit more woody, barrel-aged character of vanilla, coconut and oak to go with the honey, sweet apples and caramel.  Its a real bummer the way this seems almost complete void of all ""tripel"" characteristics.  I know the bourbon-barrel thing is all the rage, but its disappointing to find a world-class beer stripped of what makes it good, turned damn-near cloyingly sweet and labeled special.  I tend to love Allagash beers, but definitely not this one.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Aroma was of apples and lots of oak. The flavor was oak, and if this is merely the tripel barrel aged, the oak aging did wonders for this beer. A great combination of apples, bananas, some yeast, and lots of oak with a touch of bitterness in the end (yet not hoppy like tripels). Mouthfeel was normal, moderate to heavy overall. Im not normally sympathetic to Allagash and often find barrel aging to be hit or miss (ie. Im not into the trendiness of barrell aging any old beer), but this was a fine production and the flavors of the barrel aging combining with the base Belgian ale were a great combo, imo. Good job, Ally (minus appearance)! Re-rate, Dec. 2009: Not much different to really say, other than the fact that this wasnt THAT great. A decent brew with an annoying bourbon influence, as Im getting less and less thrilled with BBA beers!","","User37895"

3251,"2006-05-22",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2011 On tap at Julians - Providence, RI. Finally got around to re-rating this one and feel like I can see it for what it really is. Aroma brings up Bourbon and lightly Belgian-inflected pale malts. On the palate, it seems a bit light, surprisingly hiding the alcohol well. However, I think the overall light flavor of the underlying beer is overrun by the raw bourbon flavor and it comes across as out of balance and muddled with the Allagash house yeast, which for me, always has a slippery, soapy feel.

Originally rated 5/22/2006 - Julios Spring Beer Festival. Pour of almost yellow-green. Aroma of sweetly wicked sour Meyer lemons, with hints of coriander and light fruit alcohols. Flavor is intensely medicine to me, which does not sit well for my palate. This is hard to drink, but I can see that the use of the barrell is decent here, but I just can get into anything other than the strong belgian yeast profile. The palate is drying. Maybe a rerate?","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Aroma is an interesting mixture of sweet and tart/sour notes - fruit, yeast and woody bourbon notes. Body is a bit on the light side. Flavour is deceptive - it seems simple (maybe because of the light body?), but theres a lot going on in there if you look for it. By the end of my sample, I wasnt sure how I felt about it - the bourbon notes started to get a bit harsh - but its an interesting experiment and Im glad I tried it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"

I think Allagashs Tripel is a strong, above average example of the style - and the b-b aging doesnt compromise it for me. It actually moves it gently in the direction of a Flemish primitive, with the wood combining with the heat of the bourbon and a touch of citrus to give it a really interesting flavor that seems to bloom in the mouth.

Funky, peppery, heavy yeast aroma, some sour lemon and oak character, but Ill say it again - funky.  Taste is oaky (vanilla character), quite whiskey-ish, gets more whiskey character as it warms, otherwise spicy and yeasty, quite a bit of alcohol.  Its a little watery, but acidic, creamy, only lightly carbonated but the spice and yeast make it quite lively nonetheless.  This is a solid brew, but the oaky/whiskey character (and the booze) gets a bit much after a while - its still restrained compared to some bourbon-aged beers, but I am certain I couldnt drink a whole one myself.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

The pour is rather hazy with a thin dissapearing white head. As for the taste, it was a little more smooth on the taste than the tripel, but has a bit of a burbon bite on the finish. The tastes throughout are of oak, vanilla and some spice here and there, the bourbon really comes out on the finish. I like Bourbon, so I liked this beer.","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"
3251,"2006-02-02",3.7,"Bottle: Poured a hazy (real hazy, I just cant see through my glass) golden color ale with a medium bubbly white head with minimum retention. Aroma of bourbon is quiet easy to detect but also some real funky yeast is present which remind of a saison or even a lambic without the sourness though. Taste is a bit too sharp in alcohol at first, which kind of ruin it for me since I dont like the warming feeling. But you get used to it and it seems to disappear (or I might just be getting drunk) and then I can see some traces of a nice abbey tripel with a strong yeast profile, which provide a farmhouse side that I really enjoyed. Overall, probably not something I would go for on a regular basis but I still enjoyed. If I was to rate on experiment alone though, I would have rated this much higher since I appreciated the fact that Allagash tried to do something different.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Taste is  a big bourbon flavor upfront, followed by the sweetness of a Triple with a bourbon burn in the finish.  The two flavors, bourbon and Triple, never really blend together.

Good aroma of banana, vanilla, that all-to-familiar Allagash yeast strain and a well balanced bourbon aroma.  Even the flavor was nice, vanilla, more banana, some faint spices ... almost like a sugar cookie.  As it warmed, the bourbon started to muscle to the fore and take over.  By the end of the glass, it still tasted like a sugar cookie, but more like a sugar cookie dunked in Jim Beam.  At the very end, I swear I got a little whiff of cooked celery.

Warming, yeasty alcohol coats the mouth with biscuity, vanilla malts round and combine the flavours nicely.

I cant say I really wanted to drink a whole bottle--its too intense--but it was Thanksgiving 2005 and my wife just had a wine-glass full.

3251,"2005-08-01",4.0,"Golden color with a taller near white head. Quite surprised by the real triple look. Mild fruit and yeast aromas of a triple are carried through the mild oak and smoke. I notice if you breath deep the aromas all you catch are the bourbon and alcohol aromas, but let the aromas carry toward the nose the scents of the triple and bourbon meld quite nicely; and as I love a good triple and I do enjoy a good bourbon from time to time there not need to further defend my aroma score. The flavors of bourbon and alcohol have taken over, perhaps expectedly as the delicate triple flavor are no real match for the light fruit and spice of a triple. Finish is quite bitter and Im torn whether it is from the hops of the bourbon and spice of a triple. This one has lost a little to much of its original goodness, rather than adding complexity. I do like this, but its more because I like bourbon than I like beer.This would pair well with swordfish and a fruity salsa. I will pick up a bottle or two more for a tasting here and there with folks that like beer and bourbon. I likely am low on my rating as I realize that I like beer more than bourbon and am being slightly bias. I love beer and like bourbon and I really like the combination, but in a true beer world this isnt as good as the triple.

This batch was at 9.5 %, Ive noticed some poor ratings and Im certainly curious to know why this is seems to be such a love hate beer (maybe ageing time is a factor?).  The bourbon imparts a sweet-corn mashy sourness (if you can follow that) and maybe you just have to be into bourbon to like it (not that Beam is the best, but I really dont think it would make a huge diff.).  Not really something that I would seek out and buy in quantity.  However I think its one of the coolest beers Ive had in a while and I love a brewery that experiments.

Pours a hazy straw gold color, and is topped by a light cream colored head that is driven by an ample carbonation that dances up from the bottom of my Duvel glass.  As I pour this notes of vanilla and bourbon waft to my nose.  As I go in deeper I note that the oak/ vanilla notes are what dominate, but underneath I get notes of the Tripel that this beer once was.  There are aromatic hints of lemon peel, herbs, and hay.

The taste is initially soft and creamy up front, but then moves to a spicy Tripel dominated mid section, which then moves to a hint of oak in the finish.  The bourbon character is here, but it is not as strong as the nose suggests, and I consider this a good thing.  In the flavor the bourbon barrel is more an accompaniment, than the only noticeable thing.  This beer is pretty tasty, The notes of the Tripel are strongly here, but there is an undercurrent of bourbon, oak and vanilla.

The bourbon IS the dominant flavor and absolute focus here and its not in the same league than the tripel. It has qualities though! I was curious (got it?) to get into that smokiness.

3251,"2004-09-04",2.8,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2014 AOBF Jim Beam Barrel Aged draught.  Whew!  This one tastes alot like jim beam, and not alot like anything else.  Extremely powerful alcohol flavor, sharp, bitter and smokey.  Develops in to some coconut sweetness and has a sour finish.  This delicate, lovely tripel does not seem well suited to take on such an overpowering, harsh element.  Save the bourbon barrel for an Imperial Stout or Barleywine, not the abbey tripel.  By the way, the bourbon aged version is going to be bottled and released, so it will probably be a new beer listing.Rerate on draught at Redbones, 6/10/06.  Flat, lifeless golden body with strong copper tones and a low clarity.  Aroma is bourbon, as is the flavor.  Truly domineered by the barrel, this stuff bears little resemblance to a trippel.  Granted, I really need to try it in the bottle, as this is my second draught sample, but it wasnt even a question of carbonation, just brutally overdone in the barrel.  5/3/4/2/7On draught at Publick House, Dec 2013Certainly not as offended by this as I used to be...it is still quite bourbon-oriented and I dont think the bourbon goes particularly well with the trippel notes.  A bit too harsh, too many ""bold"" flavors for lack of a better term.  Bourbon, banana, peaches, vanilla, alcohol.  Fine if thats your sorta thing, but just takes a lot of the finesse away from the base Trippel and replaces it with some rather forceful bourbon.  Ok, enough harping out of me.  6/4/5/3/10","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3251,"2004-08-23",3.4,"Same color as thier tripel but no head- somewhat cloudy.  Aroma was of fruits/spice/yeast with a slight smoky bourbon smell.  FLavor was sweet yet balanced by that Jim beam bite and had a nice kick to it.  Tasted a lot stronger than the original tripel and not quite as smooth.  Overall a nice unique beer but I dont think I would buy a bottle if they started to bottle this.  My friends liked this a lot more than I did.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3251,"2004-08-22",3.8,"Poured a hazy gold color with no head, though it did leave some lacing on the glass.  Soft, sweet bourbon, and vanilla aroma.  Taste was very interesting as I never thought a tripel would taste good aged in bourbon oak.  There was a light yeasty, citrus character, though the finish was sweet bourbon, almost a little syrupy.  Not bad at all.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
