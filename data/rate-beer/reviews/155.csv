155,"2017-02-26",4.3,"Shared at gregwilsonstl house, next to regular Everett. It poured a black color with a dark brown head. The aroma was of dark roast, bitter chocolate, caramel, malts, light smokiness, dark fruits and booze.

155,"2016-12-29",3.9,"Bottle, split with jamesy at a super secret location. This is a lot more restrained than most barrel aged beers on the market, and a lot more subdued than I was expecting. The sweetness comes through in this more than in the regular Everett, giving it a flavor profile more like a sweet Russian Imperial Stout than a porter. Medium-low amount of bourbon flavor from the barrel aging, which adds some depth. Quite good.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

155,"2016-06-05",3.7,"Partagée en compagnie des trois amigos. Liquide noir et huileux dont les premiers millilitres dans les verres ne formèrent aucune mousse alors que le fond de la bouteille fut pour sa part bien mousseux et dense. Forte variation tant au niveau présentation, quolfactif que gustatif entre les différents niveaux de liquide dans cette même bouteille. Dans lensemble le liquide me paraît encore trop jeune. Beaucoup de bourbon et de mélasse et peu de nuances. Un liquide délicat comme Everett, à 8% dalcool qui plus est, souffre à mon avis dun vieillissement si prolongé. En effet, ce dernier sen est trouvé durement aminci et ses splendides nuances chocolatées, réduites à peu. Le bourbon a tout dérobé sur son passage et cest bien triste. Une acidité de baies rouges due au bois et à lalcool.

155,"2015-08-05",3.8,"Magnum shared by Adam C on 7/25/15.Deep, dark, porter-colored liquid (just coined that term) is of indeterminable clarity, though assumedly pretty clear, as Shawns non-IPAs usually drop bright. Tan head is good-sized and well-retained.We had a pretty good discussion about barrel aging while we were all drinking this guy and my position was of this being right on the border of my tolerance (for bourbon apparency). On one hand, the bourbon notes are not harsh/boozey and the barrel itself isnt heavily tannic, but its still quite dominant overall, pushing out a lot of potential beer character in the nose. Spicy bourbon, dry coconut and sweet vanilla are all prominent. Roast takes a backseat, but enough maltiness helps keep it balanced (balanced in the sweet vs. dry sense, not balanced in the bourbon vs. beer character sense). With warming, I did get a bit of fusel/glue-like heat.Full, soft, luxurious body is definitely a strong point here. The milk chocolate-like flavors of Everett are here dried out by the barrel, producing a more reserved, dark chocolate-like character replete with vanilla from both barrel and malt. Spicy bourbon washes over the palate, as well, and char and coconut are felt, helping to balance the big malt profile. Pleasant enough bourbon flavor and again its not sharp or raw (though theres a touch of heat here, for sure), but I just think its a bit too heavy-handed, overall, on the bourbon character. Would prefer significantly less, or better yet, none! Why change Everett, its nearly a perfect porter!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Nose is outstanding vanilla, soft barrel, buttercream chocolate frosting, coconut, birthday cake. Taste begins with rich flavors on the front of the palate (chocolate shake, cake frosting), moving to a bland/dead mid-palate, and finishing with stinging tannic astringency and papery hints of oxidation.

The appearance for both are almost identical, almost black with a small fully lasting brown head and little lacing. Aroma of the 02-2014 release is super chocolate forward with bourbon, raisins and boozy notes. The 05-2014 is boozier and quite perfume. Taste of the 02-2014 is also chocolate forward with a well intagrated bourbon presence, caramel, alcohol and light acidic notes. Taste of the 05-2014 is similar, but with more perfume notes and boozier. Body of both are medium and carbonation are moderate/medium. The 02-2014 has a bourbon/chocolaty finish while the 05-2014 has a boozy finish. Overall, the 02-2014 is much more complex, more balanced, less boozy and more enjoyable than the 05-2014, but regular Everett is better than both.

155,"2014-09-29",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Powerful bourbon envelops dark chocolate and roast in this richest of Porters.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the pure darkness.
-Bourbon vanilla sadly overpowers this brews usually wonderful malt signature.
-The body is lush, never too obese.
-Candied fruitiness is found throughout as well.
-This ones not as complex as the 2011 version, but it makes for a great dessert beer nonetheless. One to share, definitely.

Thick black pour with a tan head. Nose is bourbon and roasted malt, smoked wood, alcohol. Really nice mouthfeel. Thick but still dry. Big bourbon goodness. Smoky. Oaky. Really yummy.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"

155,"2014-08-17",4.0,"Brought back from the brewery on a trip to Vermont. A lot of pleasure drinking this. But, a lack of complexity in aroma and flavors had it lost a few points. 
Alcool et Bourbon frappent dabord le nez. Présence de chocolat, de cerises noires, un peu de bois. Lalcool est cependant dominant. Le nez est un peu moins complexe que ce à quoi je mattendais. Le visuel est noir, opaque; comme une stout. Avec une petite mousse mince.
Lalcool est également très présent en bouche avec encore une fois le chocolat et les cerises. Cest comme manger une Cherry Blossom alcoolisée. Lalcool nest toutefois pas déplaisant malgré son intensité. On y retrouve un peu de café mais cest encore le chocolat qui domine. La texture est très onctueuse et les saveurs restent longtemps en bouche. Beaucoup de plaisir à boire cette bière. Mais un peu plus de complexité en olfactif et en saveurs aurait fait plus honneur à leur réputation.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","dandeman"
155,"2014-08-13",3.7,"Bottle, cheers to Leighton! Deep brown pour with a tiny head. Pretty woody. Peanut butter and kit kat bars. Vanilla and bananas fosters. The taste is of sweet brown sugar. Cinnamon spice. Vanilla and chocolate fudge. Hot woody finish. Quite carbonated, sort of detracts from the drinking experience a bit. Still very tasty.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
155,"2014-08-13",4.0,"Bottle shared in London - procured in VT. Pours black-brown with a frothy beige head. The nose has charred wood, baking cocoa, alcohol, earth. Medium sweet flavor with some toasty toffee, burnt marshmallows, dark fruits, scorched earth, mild burnt wood. Medium to full bodied with average to lively carbonation. Warm to hot finish with lots of burnt toffee, earth, gooey charred marshmallows, milk chocolate. Good stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
155,"2014-08-13",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2014 Bottle thanks to Leighton. It pours black with a thick tan head. The nose is rich, roast, toast, earth, burnt brown sugar, nougat, unripe coconut and toast. The taste is rich, earth, roasty, acidity, toasty, spice, wood, alcohol, coconut and vanilla with a dry finish. Full body, fine carbonation and oily mouth-feel. Dunmo... Not quite there. Base beer is great, but this is not quite there.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
155,"2014-08-10",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2014 Chocolate pour with fine bubbled mocha foam. Soft, fulsome bourbon aroma with shades of coconut, butter toffee, corn cakes and caramel. The black cherry and cinnamon bark porter malts compose the sound foundation.
The flavor is luxurious and bourbon forward, finding its gentle warmth without flashing alcohol. There is a solvent-like plain chemical note in the middle that is more bland than offensive, and this is washed away quickly in the rich brown sugar cordial tide that builds into the long, velvety finish. Red berries, chocolate and tobacco bathe in the bourbon for a good while after swallowing.

High carbonation here works well with the medium weighted body to differentiate this from all the dessert-like sippers of this ilk. That it finds many of the same flavors and textures without being a syrupy, burdensome task to drink is satisfying.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
155,"2014-08-09",4.2,"500 bottle shared by yourefragile, thanks Michael. Pours a dark brown/nearly black, with lasting beige edge head. Aroma is roasted malt, smoke, bourbon, and bittersweet chocolate. Flavor is delicious and massive - bourbon booziness with bitter chocolate and malt with tobacco leaf vegetal notes.

155,"2014-08-06",4.0,"Another thank you to Matt for another great hill farmstead beer. 500 ml bottle, dated May 2014. Released a week ago. This one has a lot of barrel. Lots of oak, touch of vanilla. Bourbon taste but no bourbon heat. Some chocolate and coffee but not as much as in the base version. Carbonation was a little strong when first poured. This is a decent ba beer, but after having the regular one fresh from the growler, I have to say the barrel didnt improve it.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

155,"2014-06-17",1.8,"Very confused by this one.. I would much rather have straight up Everett any day of the week. Massive mocha bubbles. Carbonation is way to sharp lending a weird dryness to the palate. The oak character is overpowering. I love BA stouts and porters but this is probably one of the worst Ive had.
