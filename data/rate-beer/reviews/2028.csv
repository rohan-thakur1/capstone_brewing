2028,"2016-02-27",3.5,"2/23/2016: Aroma much like that of a vanilla latte; Brown in color, dense tan head; Creamed coffee, roasted coffee beans, earthy/herbal hoppy finish and some bitterness; Medium body, ultra smooth and creamy; Pretty solid, but the coffee seems to dominate the base beer; gets better as it breathes, but still mostly coffee.

2028,"2015-08-17",4.1,"On nitro tap at MadTree. Pours dark brown with a khaki head that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, roasty malts, and vanilla. Taste is fresh roast coffee, vanilla, chocolate, toasty malt, caramel, and a surpising bite of bitter hop resin. Medium bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation. Just an excellent all around brown ale! The addition of coffee and vanilla really set it off.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","jhp40219"

Aroma of roasted coffee, malt and vanilla. Medium-bodied with flavors of chocolate malt, coffee and slight vanilla. The finish is roasty with a vanilla mocha aftertaste.

Nice, toasty coffee aroma here, with underlying nuts, vanilla, dead leaves, earthy hops, and brown sugar. Coffee adds a nice dimension here.

Lightly dry finish. Good coffee flavor, lightly roast, nice lighter vanilla. Hint of chocolate and smoke. Good moderate bitter taste. Very tasty spin on gnarly brown, added ingredients work very well and make a big difference. Great coffee brown ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy roasted sweet coffee flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration.

2028,"2013-10-24",3.8,"Draft at Madtree. Pours cola brown with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have everything as advertised; coffee, vanilla, some roasted malt quite a bit of character. I like the base brown as much as any brown outthere and this raises it up a notch.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
