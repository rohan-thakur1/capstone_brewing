1617,"2017-06-10",3.9,"Great fresh smooth beginning. Intense floral fragnant, mild sweetish, round and deep. Lots of smooth round rice, not much alcohol, easy to drink, fresh smooth and very mild. Fantastic.","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"
1617,"2017-01-03",3.3,"Bottle from my friend. Apparently this is produced stateside as Sokol Blosser.

A: Perfectly clear non-color.

N: Pear, peach, band-aid, rice, some vanilla, wine grape, and yeastiness.

T: Tart and funky. Lightly sweet

M: Light body, alcohol is noticeable, no carbonation.

O: Not too bad. Im no sake connoisseur, but this doesnt strike me as half bad.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
1617,"2016-12-05",1.6,"Taste from Andrews bottle in Seattle. Clear bluish water. Repulsive aroma. Medicinal marshmallows. Warming alcohol. Juicy water. If you dont breath it, it tastes ok. Sweet marzipan, creamy body. Sweet water and band-aid. Gets better with patience. Not for me.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
1617,"2015-11-29",2.5,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2016 Shampoo bottle purchased at the market. One of the coolest bottles Ive seen in a while, and it sold me instantly, despite my complete lack of knowledge in sake. Clear pour with no head. Boozy aroma. Flavor is much smoother than the aroma suggests. Still, not the easiest drink here. Has a bit of an almond finish to it. I can see the peach now that I read it is there. Not bad.  UPDATE.  Ive held on to this bottle for a while now.  I feel like its a bit smoother overall.  Cant get over the aroma here though.  Rough.  Sweet, boozy almond flavor still dominant.  Hard to drink, but has decent qualities.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
1617,"2015-11-09",3.0,"Sample at the Decatur Wine Festival. Very clear, and no bubbles or head. The nose is vinegar and acetone, with some rose and syrup. Very sweet flavor. Light body, smooth and clean. The initial aroma is highly unpleasant, but by the end of the sample, it had grown on me considerably. Smooth, easy, and clean.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
1617,"2015-07-26",3.6,"This is the first sake Ive tried in the US, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Delightful. Got a really good deal on it too.","maple grove, Minnesota, USA","NovaChaser"
1617,"2015-05-16",2.8,"The packaging is very impressive. Sampled at winefest. Clear. less alcohol in the aroma and flavor than the white. A little more sweetness in the flavor. Light palate, some light fruit qualities.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1617,"2015-01-25",3.2,"Bottle. Clear. Creamy mouthfeel. Decent flavor.

1617,"2014-03-06",3.0,"(bottle - 330 ml) Clear water pour. Light rice and melon hint to the aroma. Sour fermented rice flavor with a light fruity melon undertone and a subtle hint of vanilla.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
1617,"2014-01-17",3.3,"Pours crystal clear. Aroma of melons and jasmine tea. Flavors include some pepper notes. Very refreshing and enjoyable sake.","Jackson Hole/McLean, Virginia, USA","Iphonephan"
1617,"2013-12-03",3.0,"Pours a slightly yellow tinted color with the clear body. Notes of rice grains, melon, and paper. Semi sweet.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1617,"2013-10-26",3.0,"Aroma of pear, dry champagne and rice. Pours crystal clear chsmpagne with no bubbles. Nice taste with pears, strawberry, and rice. Very pleasant but subdued. Does NOT taste like 15%.","Marlton, New Jersey, USA","Jesterdeal"
1617,"2013-07-20",3.2,"Pours almost clear with faint pale yellow tinge. Light fruity aroma. Sweet melon flavor with some vanilla. Slightly boozy.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","smith4498"
1617,"2013-06-06",3.1,"Clear and still, with just the slightest hue of straw.  Aroma is almost floral with a certain alcohol ester sweetness. Flavor is crisp and light, although not without a certain sweet and floral tone like from the nose. A bit of grainy alcohol ester kinda warms up the palate towards the swallow.  Perhaps the least offensive and actually likeable/drinkable sake Ive had.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1617,"2013-05-01",4.3,"wow, this was very enjoyable! .. thank you to my friend Judy for this, .. 330ml black bottle- $17 at my local Kroger .. . melon rind, melon, green melon, light sweet rice, and honeydew melon .. . such a fruity sake, but still subtle and slick .. . just a fine delicious gentlemans beverage! .. . . look out muffin head!!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
1617,"2013-03-14",4.1,"Strong yet clean koji aroma. Crystal clear, nearly colorless but with a slight yellow tinge. Fresh honeydew flavor, cantaloupe finish. Koji throughout with pumpkin flesh overtones. Alcohol evident, but less obvious than expected. Shouldnt this be classified as Junmai?","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
1617,"2013-02-14",3.5,"Had with a sushi dinner. This one stands out from the rest in the flight. Buttery, grainy, sweet, pop corn. This is okay, but there is better for the money.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
1617,"2012-09-05",1.3,"I can see why this comes with a little booklet offering recipe suggestions...this stuff is foul by itself. Pours almost colourless, the faintest bit of yellow is there. Smell is of alcohol with some rice and maybe apples or pears? The taste is pretty one-dimensional and bland with an alcohol finish. WAY overrated.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","NeoHippie2"
1617,"2012-08-19",3.0,"The label clearly states this is a product of Japan and made in Nara, Japan, so this Oregon business is confusing to me. Anyway, a clear sake, the faintest bit of yellow. Sweet grassy and vanilla aroma. Sweet flavour, too. Not spectacular sake.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
1617,"2012-08-19",2.5,"Nice bottle, pours clear. Smells a bit like vanilla, some green vegetable aromas, and medicinal booze. Nice flavours of milk chocolate at first. Slightly harsh alcoholic finish.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","cards04"
1617,"2012-05-04",2.9,"It pours clear with a slight champagne tint. The aroma has notes of: rice-pudding, pepper, alcohol, apple cores. The taste is medium bitterness that finishes light sweet; there are notes of: blossom, alcohol, lemon-zest (citrus), and pepper. The palate is full-bodied, slight harsh alcohol note, medium finish. Overall, definitely not worth the awards it was given  overrated.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
1617,"2012-03-02",3.1,"Bottle. Clear and still. Melon-like sweetness in the aroma with some lighter vanilla and cucumber. The flavor has sweet honeydew, light vanilla, and light booze. Decent.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
1617,"2012-02-02",3.2,"Bottle (Oregon production). No head (still). Body is very light yellow. Aroma is light notes of green apple, honeydew, banana peel, grain/rice, and alcohol, hint of cucumber. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent. Rated alongside the Silver, see other related notes there.  Light and simple aroma but it does have pleasant fruit character with no glue-mold odor or off notes.  Good, but a bit limited...there are better options in the $15-16 price range.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1617,"2010-12-31",3.5,"(375ml bottle thanks to mar) clearish light brown, decent legs. Nose of rice alcohol, bourbon, maple and cotton candy. Taste of maple, alcohol, smooth, rich apple.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
1617,"2010-12-16",3.2,"Trendy bottle thanks to mar. I have been passing up on this for a while. A slight yellow tinge in the pour with decent legs. Aromas of banana, alcohol, lychee, peach, hay and floral notes. Flavors of alcohol, umami in the finish, medium sweetness. Slightly fruity flavors, but pretty neutral overall. Somewhat oily mouthfeel. Decent sake, but I would bet that most of the effort is in the bottle and the marketing.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1617,"2010-12-11",1.2,"Bottle from mar.  Light pour with no head and some legging.  Aroma spice and not good.  Taste is a little green apple and peanut butter?","Arlington, Texas, USA","Fratto"
1617,"2010-12-11",3.3,"Haha, cologne bottle courtesy mar. Clear clear white appearance with no carbonation. Aroma is of popcorn, dry rice, alcohol and nail polish. Flavor is dry sweetness, salty butter, rice patty and alcohol. You really feel the burn after the finish. Smooth, yet stringent.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
1617,"2010-12-10",3.5,"clear with nice looking legs.  alcohol, fruits, plums, and light vanilla on the nose.  nice on the palate, chewy fruits, alcohol, and vanilla for the flavors.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"

1617,"2010-12-09",3.4,"cologne bottle, thanks to mar, clear in color with decent legs, aroma of bamboo and vanilla with a slight, watery melon and water chestnut flavor","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
1617,"2010-11-14",3.2,"Bottle They hit a home run with the packaging. Very nice pyramid-type bottle painted flat black. The bottles color and texture is very reminiscent of Drakkar. Pours crystal clear with the slightest yellow tint. A healthy swirl produces no legs at all. Fruity, herbal aroma  peach, caraway and a rumor of licorice. Medium-bodied with a nice, light, velvet mouthfeel. Fruity, delicately sweet flavor. The alcohol is there, but doesnt bite you back. Crisp, watery, refreshing finish. Again, great packaging, but not one of the better sakes Ive tried. Not unreasonably priced.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1617,"2010-10-31",3.4,"Bottle pours clear.  Aroma of peach, pear, melon, and lemongrass with a slightly spicy note that I cannot put my finger on.  Flavor shows the same with a moderate to heavy sweetness and clean finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","dionysus"
1617,"2010-09-01",3.3,"nice and sweet with lots of fruity goodness. lots of grass, melon and strong alcohol flavor. the taste brings well alittle bit of grass and rice.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1617,"2010-09-01",2.9,"The aroma very strong with alcohol, bamboo, grass, coconut, and rice. The appearance is clear and still. The taste is like the aroma with a bit of fruit and a lot of sweetness. The palate is oily. Overall a good sake but the alcohol overpowers everything.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1617,"2010-08-22",3.8,"Cool (overrated) bottle, pours clear with a hint of beige. The nose has some pear and apple in the nose but its mostly clean and fragrant. The flavor is smooth with a neutral bite, apple sweetness and a nice umami laden bite. Brief tail and a nice well rounded finish. Not much to go on about except for how well built it is and clean. Worth the hype. I want the white now.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1617,"2010-01-23",3.0,"Pours perfectly clear, like vodka. Aroma is of alcohol and tropical fruit- likewise so is the taste. Very rough at first but then smooths out slightly. Very sweet.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","Rustyham"
1617,"2009-11-18",3.5,"Bottle shared at Oldsmar Tap.

Poured clear color with legs. Moderate to heavy sweet apple, melon and light alcohol aroma. Medium body with a medium smooth texture. Moderate to heavy sweet apple and melon flavor with a medium to heavy sweet and light alcohol burn finish of moderate to long duration.

I would recommend this to a freind and shared it with people that could become freinds.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
