973,"2017-04-19",4.0,"Here is our first rating for a beer from Italy, a country renowned for shitty beer, but thankfully, it bucks that tradition by being pretty darn good. It pours a cloudy gold and has an aroma that combines lemony ""zest,"" belgian yeast, and a light delicate touch of that bretty funk. The taste is pretty much in line with the smell; it is complex, tasty, and hard to pin down. My better half thinks it tastes like it has a higher ABV than it does, but Im not sure thats it, but I cant quite put my finger on it. Anyway, its a good beer that does Italian beer proud.

-It doesnt feel as airy, dry and carbonated as their Blond, but its still very drinkable and refreshing.
-There is a lot of yeast in their bottles. Be careful when pouring.
-This gets more and more endearing with every sip.
-Green peppercorns appear in the finish.

973,"2011-09-10",3.9,"Bottle from GBBF. Bright yellow beer, with a bit of head. Aroma is slightly sour Belgian Ale. First thing to note in taste is a big whack of NZ hops - fresh and sunshiney, with some mango. Then things dry out dramatically, with a pithy, citrus peel spritz. The name of the beer says it all. A most pleasant drinkable beer.","Birmingham (via Leicester), West Midlands, ENGLAND","DanielBrown"
