1042,"2016-09-17",4.8,"Pours black with flat, deep tan head. Aroma of chilli, vanilla, mild bourbon, chocolate, cedar wood, mild cinnamon, just wow wow wow. Taste is sweet, mild spicy and hot, light chocolate and vanilla and then turning into a long bourbon boozy finish. The cinnamon, chocolate and chilli still lingers, mind you. One of the most complex and delightful beers Ive ever had. Rich and creamy smooth body with soft carbonation, but that should go without saying.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Ktwse"

1042,"2016-08-11",4.8,"Bottle bought at Himmeriget copenhagen, and shared with someone at the bar, poured pitch black in colour with a Nice mocha ring on the site, such an oily an vicious pour! Smell is bursting with layers. First is sweet intense pappy bourbon without getting to dominant. Sweet sticky chocolate molasses, heat, chocolate cookies, vanilla, sticky fudge, coconut, sweet cinnamon. Taste is sweetness upfront, sweet cinnamon Rolls, chocolate fudge, a lot of sweet pappy bourbon, clear pepper heat, and Some vanilla sweetness in the back. This is the best magican cake version i have ever tried! And ive had a lot of them. There i such an amazing sweet and Unique bourbon barrel sweetness, but the base beer is still so prominent in a good way. One of the most balanced barrel aged beers, perfect heat finish with a full sticky mouthfeel. Its worth every Penny ive paid for it. Wonderful beer!","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
1042,"2016-07-29",4.3,"CBCNOR bottleshare at Himmeriget, may 12th 2016. Black body with a beige head. Aroma is malty with chocolate, courbon, chili and raisin. Strong bitterness, mild chili burn, licorice, sweet cakes and heavy coffee in taste. Woody finish with a high boozyness, lasting bourbon and choco aftertaste. A little harsher than the bourbon version, which I remember as smoother.","NORWAY","daje"

A: Deep deep dark brown almost pitch black, hint of light brown head.

1042,"2016-03-26",4.0,"Bottle @ Himmeriget. Pours oily black with a small creamy mocha head that leaves some sparse spotty trace on the glass while dissipating. Smell is malty, roasty, slightly spicy, slightly nutty and boozy with roasted malts, toffee, vanilla fudge, charred wood, luxurious dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, coconut milk, cinnamon, smoked chilis and plenty of thick alost buttery bourbon alcohol. Taste is sweet, bitter, malty and tiny spicy. Mouthfeel is soft, round, oily, tiny astringent, boozy and near full bodied. Finish is sweet and bitter with roasted toffee malts, rich buttery bourbon and hints of cinnamon and smoked chilis. Great BBA impy. Perhaps a bit heavy on the barrel character.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

1042,"2016-03-12",4.2,"650ml bottle enjoyed @ Himmeriget. Pours pitch black with a brown head. Aroma is surprisingly subtle compared to the other Cake variants. Roasted malt, chocolate, liquorice root, oak, cinnamon, vanilla, chili, caramel, not enough pappy to detect and somehow a hint of lavender. Taste medium sweet and medium bitter. Full bodied, a little too thin texture, soft carbonation. Finish is mild chili, alcohol, oak and slightly dry.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Zakoon"

Aroma has cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, bourbon, milk chocolate, fudge, sweet english licorice, roasty malts, some spice. Taste is sweet, smooth, spicy, caramel, elegantly boozy, chili in the finish.

1042,"2016-03-01",4.4,"Bottle @ Himmeriget. Pours black with a tiny brown head. Not as stunning looking as the rest. Aroma of deep bourbon notes, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla and slight toffee as well. More subtle than the others on the spice note - a bit like the red wine version but I like the bourbon domination more here. The taste has big bourbon notes, some chili heat, chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa beans, weak cinnamon and some warming alcohol towards the end. This spoke to me in strange ways. Absolutely awesome.","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"
1042,"2016-02-22",4.3,"Bottle @ Himmeriget, Copenhagen. 

Pours pitch black with a small shortlasting dark brown head.

Aromas of cinnamon, coconut, vanilla, fudge, dough, cocoa, dark chocolate, caramel, chilies in the back. Definitely get the barrel characters, but not overwhelming.

Taste is bourbon up front, cinnamon, dry cocoa, chilies, walnuts, burned wood, fudge, roasty, light boozy, dry finish. I had hoped for wayyyy more barrel. Expected Assassin + MC but still a very nice beer.","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"
1042,"2016-02-10",4.2,"Pour jet black, with a small off white head. 
Aroma has slight coconut, slight chili spice and head, Wood and vanilla, chocolate fudge brownie dough, pappy goodness. 
Taste is slightly sweet up front, slight heat and roasted bitter notes. 
Medium Body, with a very fitting flat carb. I would have wished for more pappy, but maybe Im just spolied.","Aalborg, DENMARK","MotherBrother"
1042,"2015-11-15",4.5,"22oz bottle. Thanks for sharing Vark, this was a nice suprise. Black with a thin ring around the edge. Lots of bourbon, chocolate, pepper spices, oaky vanilla. Barrel is definitely present but very mellow and smooth. This one retained a lot more of the pepper and spices which complimented the super smooth bourbon perfectly. Was really surprised by this one. Didnt think that the 2014 variants lives up to the hype, the base stout which I loved was too muted by the barrel. Not the case in this one. Perfect blend of the amazing base stout with a great barrel.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
