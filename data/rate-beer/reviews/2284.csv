Lots of particles of different sizes running through it. Very sweet aromas with many dark fruits (raisins, plums, dates), caramel, toffee, burnt sugars and some spices. The taste is sweet, but not as rich as expected which makes it easier to drink. Still the dark fruits, caramel with some hints of molasses. A slight dry finish. Goes down very easily. A little too rich to have a big bottle though.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
2284,"2017-05-14",4.3,"Dark ruddy brown pour with a tall, creamy to chunky beige head that has good retention. Aroma of dark fruit, bourbon, cherries, turbinado sugar, fresh baked whole grain bread, light nutty and chocolate notes and some tough to pin down, kinda sharp fruity esters. Flavor is caramel, toffee, bourbon (more woody than anything), and dark sugar up front; then licorice, cooked apples and stone fruit, hay, hints of cocoa nibs, slightly tart, mellow cherries, some spicy, lightly peppery and bready yeast notes round out the finish. Bourbon cherries and stone fruit linger for a while. Heavy body, chewy, but somewhat creamy feel, medium, blanketing and fairly sharp carbonation. I really like this beer, everything just works together. It would be a perfect cold weather sipper with, or without a nice mellow cigar.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

The flavor is more complex; I taste plums, dates, figs, raisins, prunes, cherries, toffee (as it warms, the flavor kicks up -- not surprising). It has a medium body with a creamy mouthfeel.

the nose had aromas of bourbon liquor, dark fruit that resembled date and fig, dark bread, some dark candy, malt and sugar sweetness, some liquor alcohol, faint vanilla, some spice white pepper and liquor spice notes, 

the flavors were big bourbon liquor, liquor spice and some alcohol, there was light bread with some date and fig dark fruit, a bit of hard candy, 
a little vanilla, the cherry was in the background, 
and the bourbon liquor alcohol spice gave a bite at the finish that lingered,

Pouring the 2015 bottle into a cheap clear wine glass (who with big hands really needs snifters?) this exudes power and finesse. Figgy dried fruits and fruit cake, bread, caramel corn, just a hit of dry ethanol nothing too harsh. Wow Im drinking this room temp. Good body and light finishing bitterness, maybe slightly cool would be better. * edit * slightly cooled IS better, enhancing the delicate crispness and still showing the vanilla and toffee. Hard time detecting cherry, but its in the structure. This is honestly as good as wines many time the price.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

Its aroma featured an immediate and strong bourbon barrel scent true to its name, along with some lighter floral hops, a slight touch of barley malt and sugar, and a bit of alcohol. The taste was somewhat sweet and malty, featuring bits of cereal and caramel, but also had a big sour and bitter grain mix with a strong underlying bourbon and oak flavor for a slight whiskey-like effect.

2284,"2016-11-05",4.5,"Pours a dark, cloudy brown with a medium-sized beige head; tiny specks of sediment floats in the beer (almost like theyre suspended in a gel). The nose is incredibly oak-forward, easily showing off a blend of bourbon barrels that somewhat take a cognac character. Aromas of butterscotch, candied fruit, fruit syrup, tobacco, toffee, and definitely alcohol. The boozy smell makes me think of young bourbonsmaybe three to six years old. Flavors are initially sweet and malty (cherries & vanilla) and then moves into a bittersweet fruit note (orange cocktail bitters) plus spice. The taste of booze is present throughout but more so in the long finish. Its full-bodied with medium carbonation and really isnt afraid to show off the hot booziness.

This one also doesnt have the bourbon kick that the nose would lead you to believe. I find vanilla, bourbon, cherry, raisin, and caramel.

-A veil of foam covers the cloudy red.
-Green pepper notes are found within as well (most likely from the barrel).
-Dried date notes (Deglet Noor, not Medjool) build in the back upon warming..
-Im used to more finesse from Boulevard, so colour me a bit disappointed with this one.
-This one lacks dark malts (in my tastes) to truly link the barrel to the beer, imho.

2284,"2015-06-07",3.7,"Based loosely on the Smokestack Series The Sixth Glass, this abbey-style quadrupel is separated into a number of oak bourbon barrels where it ages for varying lengths of time, some for up to three years.

2284,"2015-05-30",3.8,"Bottle (750 ml). 2014 bottling. From Pauls CANBIF box, thanks! Split with the Québec crew.

Appearance: Slightly hazy deep amber-copper with a medium beige head, decent retention and some lacing. 

Aroma: Bourbon is the dominant feature here along vanilla, cloves, brown sugar, Belgian yeast, dried fruits and caramel.

Taste: Medium sweetness but quite boozy with a lot of bourbon, caramel, cloves, dried fruits, brown sugar, vanilla and bananas. 

Palate: Medium to full body. Medium carbonation. A bit astringent. Warming/boozy finish. Lingering caramel presence. 

Overall: It definitely have some similarities with Belgian Quads but the bourbon takes a lot of place in this one and the fruitiness is taking the backseat while malts/caramel/brown sugar are showcased. Its flavorful and well executed, but it lacks a bit of balance and its a quite a bit too boozy for my liking. Very good nonetheless.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

While most bourbon aged beers will attempt to impart a multitude of flavors, this beer does an excellent job at giving off subtle flavors of chocolate, cherry, toffee while preserving the imperial style stout and adding the best of the bourbon barrel (the fruits, honeys and oak).

2284,"2015-02-05",4.4,"1 pint, 9.4 oz bottle, poured into a wide-mouth snifter at approximately 45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a beautiful red-amber, and forms a massive off-white head with a slight orange tint. Excellent head retention, and it leaves lacing on the glass itself as it recedes, to say nothing of the lacing left by the thick ring it eventually collapses into. Tiny bubbles continually stream from the bottom of the glass, joined sporadically by the occasional larger bubble.

Smell: Delightful. Dark fruits and candi sugar erupt from the glass, heavy with plums, slightly soured grapes, and cherries. Theres a faint oaken tinge to the aroma, and vague suggestions of vanilla.

Taste: In an almost exact reversal of the nose, the bourbon barrel strikes first as the beer touches the palate, with heavy notes of vanilla, burnt toffee, char, oak, and boozy heat. Beneath those notes, the candi sugar sweetness takes the center of the rear stage, with the fruit notes off toward the wings and possibly the orchestral pit. The finish brings a slightly sour tone, as cherry and some lingering candi sweetness ride a rush of pure boozy heat. A tiny bit of wooden flavor lingers after the swallow as well.

Mouthfeel: Hot with alcohol, this is also a nigh syrupy beer in consistency, both encouraging sips over swigs.

Overall: This blends the complexity of a good Belgian with the power of a potent bourbon barrel nicely. It drinks a touch hot, but there are few nigh-12% ABV barrel-aged beers that can conceal that - a spot of age might take a bit of the edge off as well. I dont know that I would ever reach for this over a good non-barrel-aged quad, but perhaps trying one with some age on it might change that opinion.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

This was served in a chalice. 
The appearance was a nice looking hazy dark amber to brown color, shimmered nicely in the light. Half finger-ed white foamy head maintained a nice level-ness and dissipated within about a light thirty seconds leaving a speckled light lacing sticking around the glass. 
The smell started off with a cooked sweet cherry and a sweet to bready spicy clove, good. 
The taste was mainly sweet and added a decent spice to the flavor. Weird but okay sweet to spicy aftertaste leading to a dry finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping quality about it. The carbonation seemed appropriately styled and was good for me.

After shoveling 15"" of snow, I needed a reward and this was what sparked my interest in the cellar. Pours a rich, dark copper color with 2 finger off-white head. Head is long lasting and leaves a lot of lacing. Aroma - malt, vanilla, toffee, a touch of oak, raisin, and a hint of cherry. Taste - I know the description says mild cherry, but to my palate the cherry is present everywhere - take a drink and get it initially on the palate, it wafts up and fills my sinus cavity and nose through my throat, and its present on the finish long after the rest has faded. That said, as present as it is, its always subtle and not right in your face. Theres a lot of vanilla, toffee, caramel and richness on the palate. Its complex and changing as it slowly warms. The alcohol, while apparent to me via my empty stomach, is pleasantly warming. Im really digging this and it reminds me a lot of drinking a really fine port. I now regret buying only one of these...

A: Pours an apricot ale with excellent clarity. Little to no head formation. Empty surface. Rare and transient lacing. 

S: Not what I had expected. Cherries smell tart and at the forefront of the beer. As I readjust my nose, the grain starts to come through. This smells more like a Flanders Oud Bruin than a Quad. Interesting.

T: ABV is way to naked here. Jesus, its difficult to get past the Alcohol in here. Brutal. Once I get past here, there are sweet grains, oak tones, sweetness. Edit: as I have allowed the beer to breath a bit more and warm, the bourbon becomes more welcoming, balances a little better with the cherries.

M: Medium to full body with high carb for the genre. Slicks the tongue and resonates as such. Syrupy.

D: This beer is a far shy from the Sixth Glass I do so enjoy. The barrels and cherries overwhelm this beer. Maybe time does this beer justice, but right now - I cant handle it.

2284,"2013-11-30",2.9,"From the Thanksgiving Day Massacre, 2013. Pours a pretty cool looking amber-garnet with a thick khaki head that leaves some dripping lace.

The flavor is incredible; vanilla and sherry are tasted with an undercurrent of oak and booze and underneath it all faint cherries and coffee.

Aroma is a balanced blend of the malt, barrels and fruit. Quite a bit of caramel and toffee with hints of roast. The fruit is mostly cherry but with some figs and raisins as well. Oak is somewhat in the background with only hints of vanilla and bourbon. Some alcohol in the finish becoming more apparent as it warms. 
Pours a somewhat murky light brown with some ruby notes to it. Fairly large light tan head with moderate retention that slowly recedes leaving light lacing. Medium legs. 
Sweet malt upfront with lots of caramel and toffee. You pick up the cherries mid palate but it is in conjunction with the malt and it quickly fades as the bourbon and barrel qualities come into play. Some alcohol notes in the finish. Some light raisin and other dries fruit notes. The barrel quality is much stronger than in the aroma with a good bourbon note and some light, but noticeable vanilla. Light oakiness. Bitterness is medium to medium low. Finish has cherries, raisin, toffee, caramel and bourbon. The alcohol becomes more noticeable in the finish as it warms. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium high carbonation. Low but noticeable astringency and medium to medium high alcohol warmth. 
Overall a pretty good beer. I'm not sure the age helped it at all, but sometimes you find these types of bottles hiding in the cellar. I'm doing my best to drink the odd stuff down to a minimum. It's a bit too boozy for me but the malt notes are nice and they did a good job of integrating the cherries. Still a bit hot with 2 years on it.

A - Hazy ruby brown with a 1/2 inch yellowish head that forms thin islands of super tiny bubbles. Nice collar for such a high ABV.

S - Tart cherries and plums, bourbon, fruity toffee underneath earthy yeast.

T - A barrage of bourbon soaked fruit. Tart cherries, plums, figs, strawberries, and pears with a robust toffee malt. Vanilla alcohol blends through and almost turns to a sharp coconut flavor. Spicy yeast and a long woody bourbon finish.

M - Full bodied, slick at first but a soft but moderate carbonation levels out the heaviness. It can be syrupy on big drinks.

If you dont like bourbon I wouldnt recommend this because bourbon is a cornerstone flavor in this fine brew. The mouthfeel really adds to success of this beer. The carbonation is a little high for the style but helps with the high ABV. The tartness is complimentary and not overpowering. Break this out on a special occasion. A celebratory beer!

2284,"2013-03-29",4.0,"September 9th, 2011 - Boulevard Brewerys Bourbon Barrel Quad was the highlight of my very first local beer tasting here in San Diego. A fellow craft beer fan in my graduate student housing complex said sent out a call and craft beer aficionados flocked to the site. Murky, deep and a healthy and hale red-orange, even in the glass this brew stands out amongst the crowd. The subtler smells were crowded out by the raucous atmosphere, but keen notes of cherry and dry barrel aging wood were sharp and poignant, even as they blended with the aromas of other open beers on the tabletop. Mild cherry flavors lead the charge on the palate, delivering a nice, lingering acidic edge and concluding with a deep, overripe sweet cherry aftertaste. Notably for a beer this reliant on cherry flavors, there was absolutely no hint of that cough medicine flavor that plagues beers of this flavor persuasion. A bourbon burn accompanies a generally heavy alcohol push, giving this beer a powerful but elegant touch of fruits and barrel aging that I find compelling.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Nose is of cherry, caramel, vanilla, slight raisin and prune and just a bit of backing bourbon and oak. Like that can get the base beer in the nose.

Taste is more bourbon forward. Fair amount of booze in this. Cherries, caramel and brown sugar. Still quite solid. 

Slick and slightly sugary body with a hot alcohol finish. Very barrel forward in the mouth. Good slow sipper that might be a bit too young. Treatment is quite good.

2284,"2012-04-10",3.8,"In short: A moderately bourdonny, heavily caramelized and slightly fruity strong ale.  Very good big beer that is actually quite easy to drink
How: Bottle 750ml, corked and caged.  Consumed when probably around 1 year of age.  Hard to tell because I dont remember who sent it to me.  Thanks someone.
The look: Cloudy rust-color body topped by a medium beige head dissipating to almost nothing
In long: Nose shows a lot of bourbon barrels over a sweet malt backbone.  In mouth the bourbon is a bit more discreet than in the aroma.  The malts are rich and creamy with plenty of luscious caramel along with some raisins and a toasted pie crust sweetness.  Basically it tastes like a raisin pie dipped in caramel.  Unlike typical Belgian Quads that usually push the fruitiness forward, with this BBQ it was the other way around with the caramel dominating the fruitiness.  This made for a simpler Quad.  However there was an oak barrel presence that added a nice woody dryness/astringency to the beer and made it quite easy to drink.  Alcohol rather well hidden.  Drinking a full bottle was all too easy, and were talking about a near 12% beer here.  Carbonation was relatively relaxed, far from the liveliness I expect from a true Belgian Abt but that is probably due to the barrel aging.  Very nice integration of the bourbon barrels here.  And pretty clever of Boulevard to  include a subliminal BBQ message in the beer name to attract coveted demographic of fat Americans, because some of these Americans are getting so fat that statistically one out of four American weigh as much as the other three combined.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2284,"2012-02-24",4.1,"750 ml bottle. 2011 vintage, bottle #13826. Beer #2 in tonights quad comparison.

It has a beige head, but it falls faster than the previous beer. Aroma is very strong in oak and possibly brett, caramel comes to the fore after it warms up a bit. The oak definitely imparts some vanilla. The tide turns in favor of this barrel-aged version with the taste and palate. Its much more complex and has none of the annoying bubbly-filling mouthfeel the previous beer had. This beer is sweet, tart and meaty with oak flavors intermingling with dark fruits; has a dry bitter finish. Carbonation is just right here, unlike the previous beer, and the body is fuller.

Pours a deep dark chestnut brown color with faint amber hues an a massive frothy beige head that has excellent retention, slowly fading into a lasting cap. Large chunks of soapy lacing coat the glass.

Complex aroma with hints of dark fruit, spice, barrel character, vanilla and booze. The barrel presence is strong but not overpowering with hints of vanilla, bourbon, earthy oak and toasted coconut. Thankfully the bourbon isnt overwhelming letting hints of raisin, fig, plum and dark cherry shone through.

Chewy medium body with sweet chocolate malt, dark fruit and a nice barrel presence. Similar to the aroma, the bourbon is there but not dominant. Hints of toasted oak, silky vanilla, toasted coconut and sweet bourbon without being hot. The vanilla flavor really smooths things out. Underneath there is a nice malt backbone with hints of chocolate and caramel and plenty f peppery spice and dark fruit notes. Hints of raisin, plum, fig, cherry.

2284,"2011-03-05",3.5,"Bottle from Malt & Vine.  Batch 2010-1.  Pours a murky reddish-brown color with a good thick tan head that fades somewhat quickly to a thin frothy layer.  Theres lots of bourbon and wood in the aroma along with the cherries.  Belgian yeast and candi sugar join the scent as well but are not as noticeable as expected.  The flavor adds vanilla, dried mixed fruit, toffee, and light spice, that go along with the cherries and bourbon, which still stand out here.  The wood shows mostly in the finish with a lot of wet barrel notes surfacing.  The more traditional Quad flavors are diluted; Belgian yeast, dark fruit, candi sugar, they are here, but rather than being at the forefront they are burried beneath the strong bourbon and cherry.  This shows every bit of 11.8% with a rather sharp alcoholic tang that just seems to keep getting stronger the more I drink this.  Its surprising how little this resembles The Sixth Glass Quad.  On paper this sounds awfully tasty but I just think the bourbon barrel aging is vastly overdone here masking a lot of what makes the base beer so good.  I didnt dislike it though, its just one of the very few brews from these guys Ive been slightly disappointed with.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

2284,"2011-02-22",2.5,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2011 Bottle.  Okay, what in the hell?  I love Boulevard, but this...this was something of a monstrosity.  I agree with everything Im reading in other reviews, talking about the nuances of the flavors and all that to an extent, but my problem here is that I can really only taste anything once Ive gulped this down and Im feeling that in the aftertaste - whats lingering on my tongue.  To me, when I first sip this, Im getting a punch in the mouth very similar to what Id taste if I were drinking a very hard mix drink.  You can write daintily all you want about how it has an alcoholic bite or a bourbon/scotch taste to it with high carbonation to boot.  What I interpret when I see that is what I suppose can be attributed to my lowly neophyte status: Jack & Cola!  I cant shake that out of my head...this tastes entirely too potent, alcohol-wise, and to me any sort of subtlety is lost because of it. I dont know if its the bourbon barreling that did that, which I suspect is exactly what the problem is to me, but something is off.  There seems to be a good beer underneath, I just cant find it underneath that strong flavor.  I mean that in the sense that if I had seen 25% ABV written on it, I wouldve thought it made sense!  At 11.8%, to get such a liquor taste like that, I have to wonder what the point is?  This was clearly not a beer for me, though I do appreciate Boulevard making something like this.  11.8% alcohol.","Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA","Onionkid"

Pours a darker shade of amber brown with a slight off white to tan head. Some spotty lacing.

2284,"2011-01-25",3.3,"Poured into a goblet. Batch 2-2009, Bottle # 4499 of 11248.

4.0 A: Hazy medium brown color. Two plus fingers of creamy beige head with pretty good retention and moderate lacing.

4.0 S: Dark fruits with fig, raisin, cherries and currant. Light toastiness. Belgian yeast clove spiciness. Bourbon show up about as strong as everything else and competes with it. Still, not bad.

3.5 T: After sipping this, Ive found that I wish the bourbon barrel aging isnt there. The bourbon masks a lot of the subtleties that the quad beneath holds. Cherries come through big time and is very noticeable, but only hints of raisin, fig, and tobacco are penetrating the bourbon shield. Dont get me wrong, the bourbon itself is a nice taste, but the quad flavors arent big enough like in an imperial stout to override the bourbon.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good spritzy carbonation in moderate amount. No problems here.

4.0 D: Seems like I want to keep the bourbon out of my Belgians. In stouts and barleywines it works great. Hell, even my boubon weizenbock is good, but the beauty of a quad is the great things the yeast does. The yeast cant shine in a hostile bourbon environment.

2284,"2010-12-29",3.5,"From notes, 01/2010.

Caramel, red-hued body with a two finger beige head. The second pour creates an even rockier, cloud-like head. Awesome.

Plum, wood, sweet cherries, esters. The flavor of cherries is more sour in the mouth - though by no means puckering - and the whiskey comes through in a sour mash sort-of-way. The beer finishes, especially as it warms, with a spiciness: clove, pepper, some alcohol. 

Boulevards yeast is a fine specimen, and they always surprise me with how effervescent their beers are, but I wish this one was more oily and thick. Its rich and medium bodied, but it has medium-high carbonation. Not that bourbony, so to speak. Instead, the barrel-aging adds a subtle woodiness that balances the malty sweetness. 

A bit hot, but less so than Sixth Glass. Nice balance, and a brilliant beer, even if its not my personal favorite.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

Tastes of wood, bourbon, brown sugar, caramel, pecans, cherry (definitely tart and not candy-like), and is pretty vinous in nature.  Finishes more like a dessert beer with plenty of wood, vanilla, toasted nuts, toast, cake, and minimal fruit.  Slight bitterness overall, but the beer isnt overly sweet so it doesnt need too many hops.  Full bodied, noticeable alcohol, but the heat isnt as pronounced as expected, and the carbonation is at a nice level for a barrel-aged beer.

2284,"2010-10-16",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2013 A unique take on the style offering somewhat subtle, well balanced and integrated, decently complex barrel, fruit, yeast, and malt tones

A clear, vibrant, deep copper body presents several fading carbonation streamers and a smooth to frothy light khaki head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving a pair of thick peninsulas and a few spots and spatters of clinging lace 
-
Oak, mild bourbon, yeasty belgian notes, light candied malts, and shadowing cherry qualities coalesce to inspire further nuances of milk chocolate, vanilla, oranges, peaches, and fruitcake on a smooth, highly quaffable medium body with well restrained carbonation and building creaminess finishing with a pleasant layer of oak complimented by mild dancing spirit characteristics surrounded by lightly tart fruits; this one generally creates a bright, integrated experience with subtle tart, sweet, and tannic qualities mingling and complimenting to create a warm, nuanced ale which seemed to need a few minutes to completely present itself within each serving

10/16/2010 2009 Batch 1 No 9145 of 11384
 
Appearance(3)  Aroma(7): pours a deep amber increasingly hazy as the servings progress from this 750 ml bottle, a quickly dying one inch bone colored head settles to a couple strands of wavy lace and a thick ring  smells of mellow bourbon, brandy with rich wood notes and sour cherries
 
Taste(8)  Palatte(3): mildly sweet stone fruits and yeasty spices are followed by mellowing creamy bourbon and vanilla, sour and acidic cherry character persists, enjoyed the third serving the most which included more yeast, also, a little time to breath and warm was beneficial  fairly light mouth from a quad, slick, virtually no sense of alcohol with some carbonation which keeps the lighter body from being watery, surprisingly easy to drink considering alcohol percentage
 
Overall (17): a nice quad with some interesting cherry, barrel and liquor notes, major flavor elements in this one work quite well together, acidic cherries cut through and balance the rich bourbon, especially once the bourbon character subdued with some time to breath, one of the easiest drinking barrel aged +11% brews Ive encountered

Decent duration, but the beer really has lost all elements of a quad. Sixth Glass is considerably better. This was someone elses bottle though. Anxious to try my 2008 batch Ive been cellaring.2010 version: nose is still a bit muted, raisin, cherries, and bourbon deliciousness. Taste is a lot better.

I poured this one into snifters and it produced a slight white head that dissipated quickly the body of the brew was a nice looking amber to almost burgundy red in color.

The aromma of tart cherries and dark fruits were right up front in this bad boy. The barrel ageing was also present I will say this had a great nose on it, and I gladly kept mine in the glass savoring the aromas.

The flavors were just as nice the tart cherries and barrel adding a dimension to the brew that make this Quad a treat to experience. It was well balanced so every sip was a bit different sometimes It was a little sweet then the cherries picked up the sour. I liked it. The only flaw I see with this brew is it it a tad thin for me I wanted a little more in the mouthfeel something a bit heaver. The carbonation was great but the body need more.

A great brew, I dont think I have had one I didnt like from these guys. I will try to get another of these soon. This brew was the highlight of a small sampling of some awesome beers, So I say go for it if you can get it.","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

Dont know whether it was just the combination of everything in this beer, but there were subtle notes of brett in the aroma and flavor and that wasnt bad at all. Highly enjoyable.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
2284,"2010-05-17",4.1,"Pour @ NotB. Amber pour with some light head. Notes of vanilla, oak and bourbon, along with dark sugars and spices, dark fruits, and yeast notes. Enjoyable, only a slight warming.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
2284,"2010-05-11",3.3,"A: The pour is a moderate amber color with a massive off-white head and some sticky lacing.

S: The amount of alcohol in the nose is rather disappointing. The booze is not necessarily bourbony like you might expect from other bourbon barrel aged beers, but very ethanol like. It really dominates the aromas and prevents the usual quad character from coming through.

T: Luckily the flavor is an improvement over the aromas. A strong dark candi sugar flavor along with dark fruits such as figs, plums, and perhaps raisins. A mild oak (vanilla) and still an alcohol presence, along with a touch of chocolate and caramel.

M: Medium to full bodied with a very plentiful and creamy carbonation and a bit of heat.

D: Not my favorite beer from Boulevard, but some good flavors. I am curious to see how the other bottle I have matures, as I think there is a good beer here, just not exactly what I like in this case.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

There is some mild pitted fruit, but I was hoping for some cherry flavor and the barrel aging takes away any chance of that.  Full body.

Flavor is led with tart cherries, followed by notes of brown sugar, yeast, bready malts, the same spices as in the nose, and vanilla and oak, albeit less than expected for a bourbon barrel aged beer.  Full-bodied, with a bready mouthfeel and moderate carbonation.  Just a bit bitter and alcoholic in the finish, but those elements are mostly masked throughout.  Hops are hard to find in this one.

Not a whole lot to add except that this batch seems to be much bigger on the cherries and sour elements.

Aroma is bourbon, smoke, oak, vanilla, tart cherries and brown sugar.  The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some sweet cherries, figs and some spice.  All of the flavors mesh well together, and none of them seem to overpower the others.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its well carbonated and a bit creamy and slick.  Drinkability is very good, the soft carbonation makes this easy to drink considering the 11.8% ABV.

Vanilla and bourbon lead off in the aroma, but the cherry notes emerge quickly and impressively.

2284,"2010-02-06",2.5,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2013 Bottle 6932 poured a little cold and it developed a thick creamy head over a medium brown beer. Initial nose was all alcohol and bourbon, but it was cold, so let it warm before I tasted it. Initial taste was only bourbon and alcohol: I could barely find the beer base, so I waited another half hour for the temp to come up to nearly room temp. And then it was only marginally better. The bourbon completely overwhelmed everything else in this beer. With work, I could find a hint of the quad I liked just fine, but, man it was buried deep. Bourbon barrel was a bad idea. Bad things sometimes happen to good beers.

The pour is an effervescent dark ruby/orangey color with a full, fizzy, beige head which settles to a small, pillowy layer of foam and leaves minimal tight lace.  The nose is interesting with lots of baking spices (cinnamon, nutmeg), tart cherries, toasted toffee, spicy oak notes, cake-like malts, and some wisps of alcohol.  The flavor is similar with tart cherry being prominent, ginger bread cake, cinnamony, brown sugar, light vanilla bean, and some oaky hints.  The palate is nice with a nearly lively carbonation, velvety and round texture, and a medium to full body.  Finishes with some of the oak becoming a bit bitter, some mild earthy and perfumey hops, and the cake and cherry notes lingering.  I actually liked this one but the cherry seemed to hide some of the malt complexity.  However, it also seemed to hide some of the perfumey hops from the original.  The oak was apparent, but it must have been from a subtle bourbon because I did not pick up any bourbon notes.  Nice beer but seemingly not very quad-esque.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Strong aroma of dried fruit (raisins and plums), vanilla, and alcohol. Almost burns the nose with alcohol. Deep amber colored and murkey with a thick white head. Minimal lacing as the head recedes but this could very well be a fault of my glassware so I wont penalize the beer for that. Flavor is sweet with no detectable bitterness and a strong alcohol warmth. Highly carbonated and fairly thin bodied. Lingering sweet alcohol finish. 


I feel the same way about his beer as most of Boulevards more ambitious offerings; nice, interesting idea thats beyond Boulevards ability to produce. I like where theyre trying but  to go but they fall far short. This is an expensive, one-note beer; all raisins and nothing else. This style demands a complexity that i fear is over the brewers head.

People are all over the house, music spilling into every room and booze/beer/wine flowing like a river through my hallways.  The aroma is probably very good but the fire from my fireplace is over powering anything I smell.  I do smell sweetness with berries and alcohol.  It pours brown like the stank water my favorite crawfish swim in and has a nice light head that fades to a film that scrapes my tongue.  Chewy cherries and robust malt with maple syrup and something bitter on the way back fills my mouth.  I like this Boulevard.  I like living in KC.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","Harsebrau"
2284,"2009-12-31",4.2,"750 ml bottle thanks to my brother for bringing from MO. Pours a deep brown with a glowing red hue and a small white froth head. Aroma is super cherry forward, very fruity, a little bit tart, some vanilla, bourbony and pretty dark oaky. Flavor starts fruity, dark cherries and a nice light vinegar character. The boubron then really comes through strongly, really powerful which is great since I love bourbon. Finishes with oaky and woody notes, a little bit of almond, vanilla and the sweet cherries returning. Medium to full lightly sticky body and a soft carbonation.

2284,"2009-12-26",4.0,"750 ml. No. 5581. From Bottleworks. Not much of a head produced on this thing. NIce murky brown color. Strong dark fruit aroma that is easily smelled. Slight wood aroma coming from this, but not much bourbon. I will say the dark fruits are coming through more than anything. Touches of bourbon are hitting the nose, but I was hoping the bourbon barrel would have a bigger impact on this one. It is by no means a ""bad"" aroma just not as nuanced as expected. There are also slight touches of alcohol and apples coming through. Not really sure I am picking up cherries. I do get cherries in terms of flavor. I am also picking up on dark fruits and touches of boubon barrel towards the end. The beer is incredibly smooth (sometimes I find the Quads can be overcarbonated). Cherries become more noticeable as the beer warms up. Overall, a damn nice quad.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

There is a lot of cherry flavor almost like a Flemish Kriek Oud Bruin but boozier and with no real sourness. There is again a ginseng note in the flavor.

Thin, quickly dissipating and surprisingly creamy, light tan head that leaves some whispy lacing on the surface and a delicate, creamy ring on the glass. Upon uncorking this, lots of bourbon shot out of the bottle, but after pouring this into a glass, the bourbon just became one of many aromas. Slightly tart cherries with a sweeter toffee, moderate caramel taking the forefront. A smooth, subtle vanilla and oak, overriple plums, and some earth balance this out nicely. Everything really blends together for a very pleasant aroma. The flavor is outstanding. Starts with a mellow toffee sweetness before a blend of sweet vanilla, oak, and slightly tart cherries come in. A good amount of earth and more oaky bourbon come out towards the end. Finishes with a little more sweetness and an almost brown sugar taste that is somewhat syrupy, but not cloying. Ends rich and malty with a hint of tartness before a slightly dry oak takes this home. A bit of an alcohol warmth gives off the only real trace of this being 11.8%. Medium length aftertaste following a slightly syrupy, medium body. Overall, this really lived up to the hype. It was very impressive. The flavor is so complex and everything blends extraordinarily well together. The bourbon is really subtle and never allows the vanilla-oak to take away from the other aspects of the beer. Its nice to see a barrel aged beer like that. Im glad I snatched up two of these this year. Wow...I loved this.2009, 750ml bottle, #6390/11384. Figured it was about time to revisit this. Pours a deep amber-brown with a nice reddish hue. Thin, creamy, light tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is so nice with deep caramels and toffees, a light sour cherry essence, smooth vanilla, bourbon, oak, plums, figs, a light bready note, and just a hint of spice. Flavor is similar. Toffees, deep caramels, a light bread, and a nice tart cherry up front before a smooth vanilla, oak, and bourbon comes in. The barrel has diminished over the years, but still goes so well with the deep malts, tart cherries, and dark fruits that come out more towards the end. Finishes clean, somewhat tart, a bit woody, and lightly spiced before leaving a lengthy aftertaste with lots of toffees, vanilla, cherries, oak, and bourbon lingering. Just a slight hint of alcohol warmth following an extremely smooth and soft, medium body and a light, somewhat creamy, very soft carbonation. Overall, this is just as incredible as I remember it. So complex and balanced with almost no sign of the ABV%. Definitely keeping my original rating. Outstanding stuff over three years later.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

It seems similar to the sixth glass but I think this might be slightly better, hard to say.

Man, Ive been looking forward to this one for awhile, now. Glad its finally out. Their Sixth Glass is a helluva quad, in its own right. That reminds me, I need to put up a review of that. Anyway, here we go...

This looks brown at first. Hold it up to a light source though, at it is a beautiful cherry red color. Nice finger and a half of medium thickness head sits on top. Retention is pretty darn good and so is the lacing.

I can smell the bourbon here, but it only hints at it, its not overpowering. Nice vanilla and brown sugar notes. Cherries and other dark fruits. Nice sweet maltiness. Toffee scents. Hints of oak and a little spiciness.

Not nearly as sweet as it smells, and thats a good thing. Good malty backbone with a spicy kick. Hints of bourbon flavor. Oak, vanilla and a nice level of smoke. Nice cherry tartness. Hints of brown sugar and toffee.

Medium to heavy thickness. Very creamy smooth. Flows down quite nicely.

Very drinkable now, but I think it will be even better in 6 months to a year. Although the 11.8% ABV is pretty well hidden, there is still a touch of heat here. Id like to see that mellow out a wee bit more.
It is worth the wait. Another excellent entry in Boulevards Smokestack Series!","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

2284,"2009-05-09",4.1,"If heaven could have a name, it would be something with the word beer involved. My Smokestack was thick with a fluffy head which fades slowly atop her slightly hazed earthen brown body. Little to big bubbles mingle while leftover lace dances along the sides of her glass confines. Nothing could have kept her immense nose of bourbon, wood, smoke, and chocolate with very faint esters of cherries from escaping. Pie crust jumps into the picture, followed by more delicious bourbon, smoke, and spice. Seriously, someone needs to look into bottling some of these aromas. Lips atremble, we meet in our first kiss, hot and wet with bourbon, warm spices, and vanilla. Her palate is heavy and thick, but thankfully her body is not, choosing wisely to be light and effervescent for a perfect balance. There may have been cherries involved in the making of this particular Smokestack, but do not expect to find much of them anywhere in her palate. Every now and then, like mischievous children playing hide and seek, dark cherries with a hint of tartness would peek out to say hello, but then back into hiding they would go. I love smoke, wood, and bourbon so I am in beer heaven right now. As my glass quickly empties, a tart funk sneaks into her palate while my breath is a haven of warm spices, bourbon, vanilla, wood, and smoke. If I could freeze this moment to play back at some later point whenever I so desired, I would. But alas, I must bid farewell with a tear in my eye and a slightly silly grin on my face.


It is a damn crying shame that only so little of this beer was made and bottled, but even so, I am glad I got to taste what I did. Some may argue she could have had a bit more cherry and a softer balance of bourbon and smoke, but I say pish-posh. I love bourbon and I love smoke. In this particular Smokestack Series from Boulevard Brewing, a Bourbon Barrel Quad with cherries, beervana is in my glass, and all is right in this world.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2284,"2009-04-28",3.8,"Bottle that I have patiently cellared for a while now.  Pours fairly light compared to other quads Ive had... kind of a dingy dark amber with a pretty massive head.  Aromas are a little boozy (bourbon?), cherries are there (tart ones?  didnt see that coming)... Flavor is fairly interesting.  It has quite a bit of alcohol and it sure isnt apologetic about it.  It punches a bit in the flavor and as it burns on its way down.  There is a pretty good toffee and brown sugar malt presence, but it gets buried by the ABV and the fruit in the finish.  Fruit flavors are of tart cherries, white grapes and oaky wood.  Mouthfeel is fairly thin.  This is interesting and Id love to try it with a little more age on it, but I was kind of expecting more.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
2284,"2009-04-25",3.7,"SourFest II.  Courtesy of Donny.  Dark copper color with a large head.  Some vanilla aroma.  Light caramel malt flavor.  Some spices and a bit of yeastiness.  I would not have guessed this was barrel aged, let alone bourbon barrel aged.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
2284,"2009-04-25",3.6,"Sampled February 2009
A solid but careful pour, still produces a four-finger thick, pale amber-cream colored head.  The beer is a dark amber-brown color that shows a lightly hazed, bright cranberry red color.  The aroma smells of fruit (berry, raisin, some prune, and a touch of cherry), clove notes, a touch of bubblegum esters, some caramelized grain and some toasted maltiness that reminds me of whole grain bread crust and biscuit malt.  A deeper smell of the aroma yields a touch of coconut and maybe a hint of vanilla and a touch of spicy alcohol.

The taste has a certain sweetness to it, but is not overly sweet for the style.  The chewy malt adds a certain savory character to the middle of the beer.  The beer finishes with quite a bit of spiciness that seems to be a combination of higher alcohols, subtle oak, peppery carbonation, and spicy esters / phenols.  These last seem to contribute notes of clove, a touch of pepper, fenugreek, and woody ginger.  The finish has a touch of tartness to it that accentuates a touch of plum flavors; other fruit notes of berries and some notes of ripe raisin.  As the beer warms it gets spicier (barrel influence here), and more hot from the alcohol in the finish.  This has a nice browned / caramelized bread character to it as well as a flavor of brown sugar (without being sweet really) roasted biscuits.  The lack of sweetness definitely contributes to the relatively ""light"" character that this beer achieves; definitely on the light side for the style, though still chewy enough to not be out of character and is actually quite nice.

Quite an interesting beer, the barrel character is very subtle all around, this actually isnt a bad thing; the flavor and aroma are definitely influenced by the barrel, but it is subtle enough that I might not have guessed it was here if I hadnt known before hand.  This could perhaps use a bit more richness to the beer, but I do like the relatively dry quality that this beer has; it makes it a bit more savory than your typical Quad.  When this doesnt get hot in the finish it tastes quite nice and tasty.  Nice, but seems to lack something in both the flavor and aroma that would set it up to achieve the next level of flavor.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2284,"2009-04-08",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2010 Appearance: Pours an opaque, dark mahogany body with a fizzy, beige-colored head.

Smell: Decidedly sweet-smelling aroma simply coated in candi sugar scents as well as notes of toasted malts, San Pedro figs, Medjool dates (you eatm!), golden raisins, and, only slightly, barrel-derived wood and brown sugar.

Taste: Toasted and caramel malts slathered and slathered again in dark syrup. Rich dark fruitiness throughout. Somewhat subdued barrel character, but you still get hints of brown sugar and oak. Very nominal spicy hop component and imparted bitterness. Slight peppery alcohol and belly-pleasing warmth emerges on the tail end. The finish is dry, vaguely spicy, and fruity.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-high carbonation. Fair amount of stickiness to the mouthfeel, though the carbonation tries to keep things relatively light.

Drinkability: Pretty good! What, did you think BBQ was a rookie brew? Sure, you can find better quads and better barrel-aged beers, but this one still manages to hold its own.

The aroma picked up sweeter chocolates and candi sugar upfront with plenty of roast to it.. cherries came through toward the back with a candy-like impression.  The flavor found roasty black malts at the core that threw me off (much more stout-like than quad-like).. darker fruits and aged caramel gave a better quad feel as it warmed up.. bourbon, vanilla, dark spice, and toasted oak on the warm finish.

The thick and long lasting head was tan with a near peach tint and clung tenaciously to the sides of the glass. The aroma was obvious, but interesting bourbon. There is the expected oak and a little vanilla. There is also some cherry. The taste is relatively subtle bourbon at the start, but it is more obvious in the finish. Vanilla, oak and cherries throughout. The mouthfeel is very softly carbonated. There is also some light toffee and iced tea that comes through in the finish.

Hazy rusty red-brown color with a fine, ivory head that lasts.  Flavor profile is likewise dominated by dark malty sweetness, accented with yeast esters, starting with a gentle bitterness and berryish fruitiness up front, becoming malty and spicy, seeing a lightly tannic oak character enter about midpoint, and finishing with a flourish of bourbon, lightly medicinal alcohol, faint orange, more vanilla and a light-moderate degree of bitterness.

Aroma had a good dose of dark fruit - raisin, plum, black cherry, with some slight oak, bourbon and yeast overtones.  Flavor was a touch sweet, but worked well amongst everything going on, with a nice warming finish.  Good complimentary presence of oak and bourbon, and not overwhelming.  Palate was full and creamy, with light carbonation.  This is a well done Abt/Quad, and I found the BA to complement rather than take over, which was nice.  As a long time Boulevard fan I am absolutely thrilled to see them stretch a bit into these new areas.

The aroma is sweet roasted malts, caramel, raisins, and a significant hit of the bourbon that conditioned the aging barrels. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy-smooth and ""warm"". This is a very sweet beer, but the alcohol keeps the malts in-line. The flavor is  caramel malts, bourbon, oak and a light brandy-like alcohol finish. This would be an amazing after dinner beer.

Taste is the caramel malt notes right away, followed by a touch of bourbon, woodiness and a soft alcohol heat.  Way in the back is the cherry sweetness. The grassiness from the nose is present, holding it all together. Nothing really jumps out, its just really blended and meld nicely. Really gentle, unlike many BA beers I have had.

Sampled on tap at the Boulevard tasting at Lukas Wine Bar in KCMO.  Pour is brown, amberish with a tan head.  I was told this was aged for two months in Bourbon barrels, and that is the initial aroma that I pick up.  Additionally, there is sweetness in the aroma, almost raisin.  The taste is very nice.  A bunch of complexity, certainly the raisin, oak and bourbon come through on this, with almost a Rochefort 10 body.  Finish is a touch hot, but not unexpected.
