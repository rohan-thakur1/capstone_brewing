987,"2014-07-18",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2014 My Bottom Line:
Starfruit and white pepper blossom to bitter herbs and cracking straw in this perfectly dry and fluffy Belgian-style Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A mushroom of foam lies undying, lacing from top to bottom, atop the misty straw blond.
-The herbal hop finish is long and endearing.
-Carbonation is expansive and drinkability very high.
-Yeast character is delicate; lightly fruity and spicy.
-Wow, Taras Boulba and Saison Dupont have competition, folks.

Dry yeast tastes of wildflowers and dusty white pepper.  Theres just a spot of honeyed sweetness to the pale cereal malt.

987,"2011-04-14",3.6,"Tap at Bir&Fud in Rome. The pour is a hazy witbier color topped by a medium, white head. It settles down quickly leaving spotty lacework. Aroma is eggy, sulfur, moving thankfully to saison spices, lemon peel, zest, flowers, fresh herbs. Taste is spicy, light, watery, thin, very dry and floral hoppy. Palate is dry, light moving to sugary and full. Would really kick ass as a saison. A Ryan Artuso beer 100%.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

987,"2010-12-19",3.1,"A Sim rate (on tap at 4:20): Very witty, banana bread aroma. Tastes like a cross between a wit & a saison. Dull, creamy flavour with a bitter kick in the finish. Appearance is great though with a buttery yellow/gold colour & amazing head & lace.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
987,"2010-10-12",3.6,"Taste at OktobEur @ Parco Rosati in Rome, 09.10.10. Great aroma, in which spice (coriander in particular) and citrus notes alternates each other: moreover, theres a definite yeast character. Light body for a strong grapefruit presence dimmed by the sweetness of a well-balanced and smooth malt; finish is grassy persistent. Wow. Too complex for a blonde, maybe! Looking forward to have one bottle for better appreciation.","Caserta, ITALY","PatBateman81"
987,"2010-08-18",3.3,"Bottle shared with Craig in a wet, soggy piss damp field at Fairports Cropredy Annual Convention 14.08.10 cheers for sharing Craig!   Pours golden with some haziness just discernible through the white foam and my tankard. Touch of lemon and wheatiness, some sweet malts. Its simple, touch tangy and quite refreshing bit of yeast to complete the picture.   A6 A3 T7 P4 Ov13  3.3","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
