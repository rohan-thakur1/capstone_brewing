1589,"2017-01-27",2.9,"This bottled Sake from a restaurant was served at a cold temperature and poured no head in an a uncarbonated body cloudy white colored body with no lacing. The mild aroma was of polished rice. The thick mouth feel was vinous with a mellow vinous alcohol aftertaste. The sharp flavor contained notes of vinous alcohol over polished rice. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1589,"2016-10-01",3.4,"BottleÂ… After being agitated to rouse the sediment, this sake pours murky and white with white grit left on the glass everywhere the sake touches. The aroma features sweet coconut, rice pudding and vanilla. Full-bodied and gritty with no carbonation. The flavor is sweet, milky and coconuty. Tasty. Interesting. Fun.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Sour cream and yogurt finish. Between the texture and appearance of this sake, I had a lot of trouble enjoying it.

Aroma of sweet rice and milk, yeast and alcohol, light bit of pineapple. Mouthfeel is like milk, as well as a touch pasty and lightly grainy. Lacing consists of a light grainy whitish coating inside of glass. Flavor of sweet rice and milk, lightly yeasty and a bit hot (but not detracting).

1589,"2008-08-06",3.2,"Iâ€™m new to sake, but I liked this.  It is creamy with a little bit of funk to it.  The mouthfeel is pleasant and a little silky.  There are undertones of vanilla cream to this mild, yet complex beverage.  I might go on to try more nigori sakes.","Centreville, Virginia, USA","JamesD"
1589,"2008-06-10",3.5,"A nice pour brings a swirling mist.  Nose is sweet with pears and rice.  Flavour is light with a vanilla overtone.  The sediment is plentiful, but I found it cleansing with my meal between courses.","Normal, Illinois, USA","peter"
1589,"2008-02-28",3.4,"Not crazy about this one. Pours cloudy white with some creamy residue on the side of the Masus. Nose is sweet and creamy as is the mouthfeel and taste. I mostly get the taste of coconut with this one and someone else thought they got pineapple. Not a great Nigori IMO. Alcohol presance is low to me.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1589,"2008-02-15",3.4,"I sent a photo to be uploaded. Aroma is quite strong and consits of fruit, rice, and sweet cream. Appearance is a watery milk color with a film on tom and a a film that coats the glass. Taste and flavor are a bit on the harsh side and have a bitter finish. The 14-15% indicated ABV really shows, the alcohol feel and taste is heavy and evident! Mouthfeel is ultra creamy.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1589,"2007-09-11",3.4,"My 1st sake rating...
8/09/2007:  Snow Beauty is white in color (like coconut milk) and cloudy (not a surprise since this is an unfiltered sake).  The moderately strong aroma contains rice and vanilla (reminds me a bit of rice pudding!).  Wet wood, delicate black walnut, coconut, and a hint of alcohol can all be found in the flavor.  It isnÂ’t really sweet, but it isnÂ’t sour or offensive in any way either.  This sake has a medium to medium-ful body and has think, creamy, and gritty texture.  Overall I enjoyed this sake and discovered quite quickly that for the most part I prefer unfiltered sakes such as this one over the filtered ones...
Chilled 300 mL / 10/15 fl. oz. bottle (Alcohol 14% to 15% by Volume) shared by Tmoney99 at The Party Source.  Thank you very much Tom.  I appreciate it!  Rating #4 for this sake...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
1589,"2007-08-09",3.2,"Chilled bottle. Cloudy white pour with sticky legs. Moderate coconut and melons aroma. Medium body with a creamy texture. Medium green apple and rice flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations were met.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1589,"2006-12-03",3.3,"Comes in a frosted blue bottle.  Served chilled.  After shaking the bottle up as suggested on the label, the sake pours an off white.  Smells of soy, rice, mellow alcohol.  Taste is sweet with the alcohol surprisingly subdued.  Lots of ricey flavors dominate.  The mouthfeel on this one is extremely grainy and velvety.  Finish is light ricey alcohol.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1589,"2006-10-26",3.1,"2006 250mL bottle (fresh on the shelf, so I am assuming so, anyways) consumed on 9/30/06.This guy dosent mess around with the sediment.  Easily the most I have yet seen in a nigori, creating an intensely milky body, with some rough rice hull pieces quite notable.  Dosent leave legs on the glass, so much as it leaves a film of sticky rice particles and clear liquid.Coconut, of course, in the nose, but here itÂ’s not quite as assertive and fruity, being more rounded and, most likely, dulled by the extreme amount of sediment.  Very nutty, much like almond paste, with hints of vanilla and bean curds.  Alcohol is well-concealed, and there is only a slight amount of rice sharpness.  Medium strength of aroma.As much as I appreciate unfiltered beverages, this one might take just a bit too far.  The rice hulls are very coarse and provide a very gritty texture, which I must admit is quite disconcerting.  Still, there is some creamy vanilla-coconut flavor, with light melon and almond mixing toghether.  Very dry on the end, and somewhat astringent, or probably more accurately, bland from the sediment.  Alcohol is again, well-concealed in flavor.  Tapioca-like flavors emerge as it warms, yielding more flavor and the finish is still highly coconutty.  Still donÂ’t feel like I have much concept of nigori, let alone any sake.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
