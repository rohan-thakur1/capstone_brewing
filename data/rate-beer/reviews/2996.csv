2996,"2017-02-15",2.2,"330ml bottle - shared by Juks - thanks!
Pale, brief sudsy head, looks brewed with sugars more than malts. Scary malt liquor aroma, some sickly berry jam, something a touch vomitty too at the corners. Alcohol not hidden. Light palate, again says adjuncts, pleasant carbonation. Less unclean taste, fermented adjunct base, quite a punch of alcohol, more berries and skins, some tanniny thin bitterness. Finish is decently fatty, shows that some attention has been paid to the hops. Oooof, this is only for the brave. Or the stupid. Im no fanboi, but Im no hater either.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

2996,"2013-01-19",2.3,"Bottle. Its a clear one, golden in color and topped by a small, dense, off-white head. The aroma has some alcohol sweetness, as well as generic fruityness, yellow apples and some maltyness. The flavor has quite a lot of alcohol, but not as pushing and disturbing as found in some strong European lagers. Enough bitterness, especially in the end, to deal with the sweetness, still its not a very balanced beer, as the alcohol plays a too dominant role. Full body, warming and pleasantly carbonated. Lasting finish. Not a beer to drink on its own, but far from undrinkable. 130119","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
