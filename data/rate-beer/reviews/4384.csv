4384,"2017-03-30",3.4,"a little soy sauce some caramel some chocolate flavoring and some hops. kind a like a mish mash but it turns out ok. kinda beery and the hop is kinda citrusy. some decent roasted malt in there.","New Jersey, USA","BREWMUSKCLES"
4384,"2017-02-21",3.8,"Bottle. Interesting blend of styles. The pour is visually quite inviting, dark and opaque with a tower of protective foam that doesnt quit. The aroma is a wonderful American hop flourish. Onto the palate, the hoppiness is far less evident. Instead I get pretty much a classic German dunkles, although lighter on the caramel. Its slightly roasty, and I guess the more I drink, the more I detect that American twist of a little hops. Like it alot; hard to describe. (#6518, 2/21/2017)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
4384,"2016-05-23",3.6,"22oz bottle. Poured a dark brown color, cola color perhaps. Fizzy slightly off-white head. Tasty hoppy Schwartz which is better than most black IPAs. Crisp malt notes, light chocolate roasted malt character. Pretty drinkable.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"

4384,"2015-11-22",3.7,"From the bottle the pour is dark with a brown head that quickly dissipates, the aroma is light chocolate and malts, the taste is chocolate and a little sour that communicates hops, the carbonation is great, the finish is chocolate but does not linger and ends clean.

4384,"2015-08-29",3.9,"Release #1, 5,5% ABV, DEN: 2263
Deep dark brown coloured body with a nice rich black glow and a dense, three to four centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of rich roasted malt, a touch of light smoke, burnt sugars and a lot of pungent hops. Medium-bodied; Strong rich roasty flavours throughout with a smooth bitter hoppy note, some herbs and grassiness and a light sweetness. Aftertaste is robust, complex and fairly fragrant - nice and pungent. Overall, a very nice beer with a great full flavour, nice layered flavours and a smooth complexity. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in Alexandria (Old Town), Virginia on 13-June-2015 for US$7,99 sampled in my hotel room here in Alexandria, Virginia on 29-August-2015.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
4384,"2015-08-14",3.5,"651 ml. bottle. Release 31. Den# 2263. Pours a medium, poorly retained beige head, over a clear, dark brown (SRM 30) body.....nose is roasted malts with heavy chocolate, lighter coffee, not burnt, no esters, herbal hop notes, balance to the malts.....taste is ever so slightly sweet to start, with light caramel notes, roasted malts come in to dominate with cocoa, chocolate, coffee tones, becoming drier with slight residual sweetness, light lingering herbal hop bitterness, no esters, balance to the roasted malts......mouth feel, body light of medium, slightly sticky, no alcohol, no astringency, carbonation creates a creamy mouthful. This is a clean, roasted malt dominated beer. As such it meets the style except it is a bit too rich. A change in malt bill would correct. BJCP 8/3/13/4/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"
4384,"2015-07-03",3.5,"Aroma of smoke, black coffee and malt. Pours a dark black color with a thick lasting tan well laced head. Taste of smoke, malt and coffee. Medium body with a mildly bitter coffee finish.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","Luvystypotables"
4384,"2015-06-24",4.1,"Appearance: very dark brown, with two fingers of rich tan head.  Aroma: big and roasty with coffee, dark chocolate, earthy and grassy hops, with a bit of citrus. Taste: black coffee, dark chocolate, some spruce, then a nice grassy and light citrus hop character with a hint of wood in the background.  Finish: dry, smooth, and roasty; palate is soft but has nice lively carbonation. Notes: Very nice schwarzbier. A little more grassy and citrusy than the Devils Backbone Schwartz, so the collaboration elements were clear. Enjoyed this one.

4384,"2015-06-10",4.1,"Brown sugar, with faint wood, coffee, and pine aromas. Mahogany, thick tan with good retention. Charred oak, pine, heavily roasted malt and maybe some unmalted grain. Medium body, easy carbonation. Not really all that hoppy. I suppose I expected this to be like an India Black Lager if such a thing existed. Tastefully done and enjoyable.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
4384,"2015-05-22",3.7,"Bottle. Release #1, 5.5% ABV. Black bodied with a tall, dense, frothy mocha colored head. Aroma is chocolate covered oranges, roasted malt, floral hops and toasted dark bread.

4384,"2015-05-09",3.7,"Bomber, thanks sevenhokie! Roasted malt aroma with notes of chocolate and smoke. Pours black with one finger of light brown head with good retention and some lacing. Starts rich roasted malt flavor with creamy mouthfeel presumably from flaked barley. Finishes smooth with nice chocolate and a bit of smoke flavor. Good brew!","","zoucrew102"
4384,"2015-05-08",3.4,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is black (non-opaque, flashlight tested).

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, cocoa powder), lightly hoppy (grapefruit), with a note of licorice.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

A pretty quaffable rendition...doesnt offer a lot in the aroma (and its a bit Americanized in that regard too), but the mouthfeel and appearance are nice, as is the flavor balance. Solid but short of exciting.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4384,"2015-05-05",3.3,"Bottle. Deep black with a lasting brown head. Aroma is pine resin, hop pellets, chocolate malt, roast, marijuana, green / herbal coffee, cocoa powder, dark extract syrup. Medium body, lightly sweet, oily and syrupy mouth feel, dusty malt is quick and short, raw hop resins push the bitterness from middle to the finish, eventually it just lasts forever. This is about what you expect of Black IPA, strong roast and American hops, nothing about it relating to German Schwarzbier, other than the lack of esters, which is fine. Its a one-time purchase for me, not bad, no faults, its just very raw and western.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

4384,"2015-04-13",3.9,"Black pour with a foamy lightish-khaki head. Nice but calm nose of biscuity roasted malt and a kiss of cocoa, and just the lightest bit of earthy coffee. Lovely quaffable body with a nice fullness, featuring roasted dark malt, but its nowhere near overbearing. Just right and roasty with some cocoa sweetness to balance, and a touch of earthy semi-dryness to finish. Very balanced, dark tasting but without the body. Just nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
