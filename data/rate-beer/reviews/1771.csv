1771,"2014-08-03",3.3,"On tap @ Kick. Unclear golden body with a medium sized, lacing of-white head. Aroma has a lot of fruit and freshly baked bread. Flavor is quite fruity as well with bread, yeast and some caramel malt with pleasant bitterness. Medium body and quite much bread in aftertaste as well. Interesting as a lager, does not remind me of any other lager at all. Have a slight suspicion that the previous beer at the tap line could have some influence on the flavor. Anyway not bad at all.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
1771,"2014-07-17",3.3,"On tap at Kick. A hazy amber colored beer with a dense finger thick off-white head. Its rather malty on the nose, bread, caramel and a faint roasted touch. Herbal, light resiny hops. Its full bodied and softly carbonated, with bready malts, some caramel and a nice bitterness in the flavor. Lasting finish. Quite pleasant and easy drinkable, was a bit surprised over the maltyness, but its nice anyway. 140717","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

1771,"2014-06-18",4.1,"On tap at Cafe Sara. 
Glowing brass. Lovely beer, Id classify this as an Alt. Fruity, yet dry. More carbonated than a standard Alt, thoug, not for the worse at all. Wood, resin, blackcurrants. Dry tail.","Oslo, NORWAY","KnutAlbert"
1771,"2014-06-13",3.2,"Medium amber body with a small, white head. Strong aroma of caramel, fruitiness and roasted notes with hints of wood smoke. The smoke is present in the flavour as well, making this stand out from the crowd of vienna lagers available in Norwegian grocery stores. The taste is light sweet with a long and moderate to light bitter finish. Mid-bodied, dry texture and moderate carbonation. A fun one.
