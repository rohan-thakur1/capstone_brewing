The taste is extremely complex and unusual - leaving a lot to mull over. There are some intense notes of bitter, Italian Roast coffee that come to the surface every now and then. Occasionally a hit of a well balanced, malty, fruit-cakey, ordinary extra stout flavours will dominate. Infrequently acrid, overly dry notes of black malt will crop up and unbalance things rather. Regular waves of light, acidic, interesting sour yeasty, saison-like flavours also appear. The mouthfeel has a depth which betrays the high strength, although the pillow-y Trappist-like smoothness of the mouthfeel of the beer (presumably caused by the addition of the candy sugar) neither hugely contributes-to nor takes away from the experience. It is a beer that I would buy again, but definitely not something I would go to when looking for a comfortable, easy drink.","","Lukehh"

1955,"2014-08-22",4.0,"Look: Pours with huge, thick, darker mocha head. It has a very slow, rock solid retention, leaves a thick layer for the whole ride. Dark, dark brown, some carbonation visible. 


Smell: Fresh! Bit of chocolate milkiness in the dominant dark coffee; caramel and candy more hidden but still there. Also some dark berries (wild cherries) and dry fruits, fresh cacao and earthy, spicy notes. 


Taste: Dark fruit freshness, great start, acidity well represented. Continues to medium, lively middle sweetness, again mostly coffee driven. Ends with medium bitterness with small boozy spike towards the end. Strong dark coffee dominates in the after but mellows down with more sips. 


Mouthfeel: Full body, light heavy, lively carbonation, almost dry finish.

I have already known from previous experience that this beer seems to age exceptionally well, especially for its not particularly very high abv. What is a very respectable and well-balanced stout in the fresh version turns into something magical in the older versions. On the first tasting, I felt the 2008 was the uncontested champion, but as a sipped more, the 2004 seemed more and more a contender. No off-tastes or anything unpleasant even in the ten year old version.

Pours a very nice deep chestnut brown which becomes dark brown to black when the glass is full. Huge 1-2 inch foamy caramel head settles to about a 1cm lacey foamy head. 

Aroma is basic Belgian earthy yeast.  You get some peppery notes, and some roast aroma. 

Mouthfeel is medium heavy.  Carbonation seems adequate but possibly a little light.  A bit of a creamy feel but it's mostly from remaining foamy head, though some is from the malt.

Taste is nice.  Malty sweetness is evident on the front end, and then carbonation, roasty malt and a bit of tang on the middle. spicy and perhaps a bit pepper on the middle.  Little to no alcohol for 9% abv.  Maybe a bit of licorice as other reviewers noted.

In retrospect, I might have been slightly too harsh on aroma and appearance, but overall I still agree with my previous assessment. This doesnt really come together.

1955,"2012-10-19",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2015 Tasted from 33cl sloped Belgian brown bottle (02/2012) into a Willybecher glass. It poured an opaque very dark brown color, hazy reddish at the edges, with ENORMOUS, firm, rocky, purplish-beige foam and lace that never went away. It took four really slow, staggered pours to fill the glass; so persistent it was annoying to be honest. Emphasis was definitely on the Belgian yeast aromas: strong black pepper, clove, plums, figs, black cherries, active compost. Faint burnt grain and noble hops underneath. Aromas and flavors reminiscent of a boozy, sparkling port wine, if there was such a thing. Other flavors were toasty, very melanoidin-y, cidery, light lacto-bacterial sourness, almost no residual body or sweetness. I didnt get the claimed caramel, coffee and chocolate, maybe the slightest hazelnut and licourice. Definite charred grain bitterness, but too highly attenuated to seem anything like a stout.. Palate was very light but alcoholic, extreme carbonation, slick spritzy mouthfeel, lingering overripe fruit and red wine aftertaste.

1955,"2012-04-23",3.1,"Originally reviewed: 10/14/10. Bottle picked up at Brawleys in Charlotte per the suggestion of the lady working there. She said that it was her sons favorite stout. Alright, lets try...

11.2oz bottle poured into an odd-shaped goblet style glass. Popping the cap released an energetic force of carbonation, and this quickly became a gusher. Huge layer of foam when I pour this. It takes a few minutes to pour out the entire contents. The color is sort of a muddy dark chocolate brown. Not as dark as expected. I thought it would be more black. No lace left behind. The frothy capper yields scents of mashed apples, some sour notes, faint yeast, and just hints of roasted character. Not entirely what I expected, but I still like it. 

The excessive gusher should have tipped me off that this would be a highly-carbonated beer. The feel is a bit too spritzy for the style. I like my stouts smooth and creamy, albeit heavy. This one is crisp, sharp, and bordering on harsh. Though it is a bit lighter than expected. This lightness allows me to sip this with greater freedom. The sourness crosses over into the flavor as well. The yeast becomes a big player, but some chocolate comes forward as well. I like the slight roasted quality it has, but the sourness becomes tiring after awhile. Glad I tried this beer, but I probably wouldnt seek this one out again.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

1955,"2012-02-11",4.9,"So I first tasted this beer at a Belgian beer festival I was running. It stands out for its complexity and simple drinkability, and was rightly one of the stars of the festival - selling out before anything else.

Its a true biere vivante - rearing up at you as soon as you pop the cap. Pouring is a tricky, lengthy operation.

Once youve tacked getting it in the glass you are confronted by a rocky espresso colored head which dies down eventually after some time, leaving about a cm of decent thick, but not creamy, foam.

The nose is fine with plenty of spice, a dustyness and some slight salty sea tang. The beer itself is black as night, giving way to a cloudy dark coffee it you hold it next to light. Its body for me suits an export stout being just the right side of a syrupy Imperial.

So the important part... Bitter chocolate is the obvious road, but the really good stuff - 80% plus, that immediate lightness followed by the eventual mouth filling all encompassing bittersweetness. But the initial taste is much subtler - candy sugar, quite distinctively Belgian. Layers of tart cherry, raisin biscuit complete the deal.

In my opinion one of the finest stouts available anywhere.","West Yorkshire, ENGLAND","briggatebeer"

1955,"2011-08-28",3.0,"Appearance: very dark brown with a full, foamy beige head and thick lace curtains.   Aroma: espresso and licorice immediately, then some lactic tang, then some spice (cinnamon, clove), then a little chocolate and toast.   Taste: slightly sour and tangy dark fruit (almost like a red wine), with a dose licorice right up front, but then a pleasant wave of bittersweet chocolate,   Finish: toasty malts give way to a talc-like dryness, with a hint of basement mustiness and, eventually, an alcohol burn.   Notes: Really liked certain characteristics of this beer--the roasty chocolate flavor and the medium-bodied easy-drinking palate. Other aspects I didnt love--the sour, lactic tang and the funky, dusty finish.  Overall, not bad.  Sunday morning breakfast stout of the week.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

Lively carbonated, medium-bodied and feels sticky to oily on the palate. Flavors are quite yeasty and there is initially a nice little alco-punch.

Aroma of cacao, ash, slight smoke, and some earth spice.  The taste definitely takes a turn for more of a rustic sense.  Earthy, dirty, ashy, roasted malt and chocolate are at the forefront of the flavors with some anise notes hiding in the finish.  The roastiness of the espresso is at times a bit astringent, but it tends to work with the chocolate flavors similar to a chocolate covered espresso bean.  While all the flavors work well together, the beer is just a tad too effervescent.

Pours a thick, dense black with not so much as brown on the edges and a deep, thick tan head that rises above the lip of my snifter. This is as good of looking a stout as you will ever see. The head slowly recedes into a nice cream capping the beer leaving some nice lacing.

The smell is rich and roasty, with a nice hit of chocolate. It has has a creamy bready overtone to it that melds great with the coffee and cocoa scents. The yeast provides a mild twang and there is a bit of licorice over it all.

The taste is pretty wild. The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated for the style but the flavor is BDSA meets stout. It has a ton of dark fruit over top a chocolaty coffee base.

Overall this is an entertaining and unique beer that I would try again.

The taste has evolved much better than expected. A full palate of coffee and some dark chocolate stand out very much now. Very nice beer.","BELGIUM","Barrelbelly"

I open the bottle and it explodes. Well, it doesnt but it feels that way...
...I have it all over my T-shirt, hair and carpet.
I run for the sink, but it keeps running out of the bottle. They should have a lable on this like on cigaret packets: ""Warning, ...""
After cleaning I finally pour some into my glas and it is all head.
Nice fluffy light brown head. As it sinks a dark dark brown liquid turns up.
Very roasted, coffee like with a peppermint like chocolate:)
High high carbonation and long aftertaste, although it is a little thin considering the carbonation and ABV.
Overall a very good stout.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"

Dark brown color with a big fluffy head that slowly settles. Jeez, this thing almost makes me feel it is infected. The aroma is a mix of sweet dark fruits, licorice, and coffee grounds. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. Alcohol is fairly prevalent in the taste along with some sweetness and some biterness in the end. Sweet candy fruit taste that quickly transitions and is really interrupted by the carbonation.

Initial is similar heavier side of body, cocoa and roast mix with dark fruits of prune and figs, a touch of anise come is in with faint spice.

Chocolate and a slight roast present near the end, as well as a nice yeasty dough note. Palate is very effervescent while maintaining fullness. Interesting for sure.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

1955,"2009-12-11",4.0,"Almost black with an enormous beige and rocky head that settles in an uneven fashion and leaves lots of lacings.

A very interesting smell. Roasted malts are prominent but not dominating. Lots of yeast, planting soil, slightly tart fruits and a strange spicy notes. A note or iron and perhaps just a faint hint of funk.

The taste is rather different for a stout. Sweet roasted malts, a note of burnt coffee and tannins, and a mild fruity tartness dominate. Notes of earth, yeast, wood, spices and sweet dark fruits. The finish is bitter with a complementing tartness, a prominent note of iron, and wood. I really like this.

Medium to full body and lively carbonation.

Tart stouts can be something of a hit or miss, and this one really hits the mark. It has a good balance between roasted sweetness and fruity tartness and its an interesting encounter from start to finish. Lots of character and a complex composition.

More funk and earthiness in the nose than Im used to in a stout.  I find this pretty intriguing when complimented by some of the more traditional stout aromas: roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, even some hazelnut.

One of the longest lasting heads Ive ever seen on a beer. I was very surprised by how sour it was. A very nice beer, but it would be even better if it were slightly less sour.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was opaque black in the glass with a large to huge, thick foamy, tan head that very slowly diminished, keeping almost the whole thing and leaving fair lacing. The aroma was a little weak but very nice. There was moderate milk chocolate and cocoa, and lighter roasted and coffee malts, light to moderate yeast, a little sour fruit, a little tobacco and slight licorice. The initial flavor was sweet, sour, and slightly bitter; while the finish was fairly sweet, rather sour and a little bitter with and average to long duration. There was roasted malt, cocoa, milk chocolate, sour coffee, sour fruit, yeast, a little chocolate syrup, and a little licorice. The sourness decreased a little near the end. The medium to full body was creamy then very dry with rather fizzy carbonation and a heavy to harsh astringent and light alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

1955,"2009-07-05",3.8,"Enjoyed from a 11.2 oz bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The sample pours a dark brown to black with a very long-lasting tan head.  Notes of malt sweetness, Belgian esters of plums and raisons, and some bread come through in the nose.  The palate initially brings a note of malt, perhaps Special ""B,"" followed by the characteristic characters of a foreign export stout- roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some assertive hopping.  The palate finishes with the sorts of esters one would normally get in a Belgian-style dubbel.  The only thing I found to be a negative was the level of carbonation, which was on the level of a tripel; so much so that the bottle overflowed when opened, causing the loss of at least 1/4 of the contents.  The alcohol was well-hidden, contributing a simple warming in the throat.  Overall, a great beer and excellent variation of foreign stout.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Aroma has more trademark De Dolle estery yeast, along with some interesting green apple, Fuji apple, and dark chocolate.  Upon first sip, one realizes this is no ordinary Impy Stout, or not one that Ive tried before.  Front palate yields sour apple dashed with bakers chocolate.  This is complemented by chocolate covered cherry.  No real coffee or roasts present here.  Palate features pearly carbonation, and a prickly feel initially that moves towards a lingering, soft finish.  Overall, this beer is absolutely unique, in a way that I love!

1955,"2008-10-13",3.7,"33cl bottle. Pours deep opaque black with an absolutely immense brown head. The head faded unevenly leaving interesting crevasses and pockets of air as it slowly went down. It fades slowly into a persistent thin disc of brown that has variations in shade (tan to brown) with interesting concentric circles and spots. Mesmerizing. The aroma is intense: chocolate, subtle sourness, dark fruit and raisins, alcohol, and standard De Dolle house yeast character. The flavor starts with subtle acid and lots of dark roast and dark fruit flavors. Acidity/sourness grows slightly as the beer remains on the palate - but never gets intense enough to label this a sour ale. There are notes of wood and subtler notes of treacle and licorice in there, too. The beer finishes rather full on the back of the tongue with a great level of malts, roasted grains, burnt toast, and persistent subtle acetic quality (like a drop of balsamic vinegar). The back of the mouth tastes a lot like a mix of red wine and espresso with some caramel toffee thrown in for sweetness. The mouthfeel is lively and much softer than expected given the huge head that poured out of this bottle. I guess the carbonation is quite delicate and bursts forth upon pouring, leaving only a balancing level of suds that help make the body creamier and lighter while providing only the slightest of tingle to the tongue. The body is rather full. The beer is quite filling, too - and warming with alcohol (though the flavor hides the alcohol amazingly well). Overall, a very complex and interesting stout but a tad bit unfocused. It would likely show great improvement after some aging (I picked this up just a few months ago and can only assume it is a fresh bottle that is young from the brewery).","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

1955,"2008-10-11",3.5,"11.2 oz bottle. Slightly tart, vinous and seemingly roasty aroma. Bittersweet Belgian chocolate. Wisps of funky De Dolle yeast. Watered down espresso. Prunes and raisins. Not overly bitter roasted malt. Interesting mix of malt and tart yeast. Pours nearly opaque dark brown with a fleeting thick khaki head. flavor is fairly anise heavy. Bitter chocolate. Roasted malt. Some very earthy and slightly dirty hops. Espresso. A vinous yeast presence throught keeps things at least semi interesting. Medium bodied with distracting and mouth filling carbonation. Finishes rather short, roasty and a tad tart. 

The bottom of the bottle with the yeast is worlds better than the top 7/8ths. Carbonation is toned down, yeast shines through, anise is tamed. The funkiness of the yeast work wonders with the roastiness of the malt. A warming alcohol presence lingers on the finish. Bonus points for the yeast pour, but the majority of the bottle just didn’t do it for me.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

Starts of airy and explosive with signature belgian yeast profile, a bit spicy and backed with fruit. Then into the chewier caramelized malts, toffees and espresso beans. The darkness ramps up. The some mature complex alcohols and ruby red fruits. Finally, a quick flourish in brief hop and yeast juicyfruit. All of this over a rather light and delicate body.

Aroma has started developing more of that traditional De Dolle acidity that mingles with the caramel, figs, and some roast.  Alcohol is there too, but only a mild spicy backnote.  Body is full, luscious, like drinking milk chocolate.  Big strong dark fruit up front, carbonation helping it from being too heavy.

1955,"2008-08-20",3.6,"First snifter is nothing but a beige head. Though EES calms down a bit and I can eventually find some liquid at the bottom (its dark brown with hints of red), the head is excessive throughout. Nose is roast, dough, alcohol, and lots of sweet dark fruit. The flavor is very similar, but burnt and bitter with less sweetness and more roast. Palate is thick and creamy. Not very complex, and coffee stouts are slowly fading from the ""favorites"" list, yet this is still smooth and rather cohesive.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Plum skin, cherry skin, apple skins, but the blackness of the beer comes through with roasted chocolate midway through the sip to mute the sprites of tart fruits.

1955,"2008-07-11",4.6,"12oz bottle. Been curious to try this, stouts from funky brewers can be sometimes astounding and sometimes wierd and offputting. Nose on this one is amazing. Reminiscent of the Expedition Stout but with a light tart citrus note. Very chocolate with coffee roasty notes. Awesome near black pour with a huge impressive chocolate colored head. Huge retention and terrific lacing. Taste wise I think this is amazing. Up front you get chocolate then tart sour cherry but very light which carries away some of the bitterness the finish is roasty and chocolately with a sweet note and lingering chocolate on the palate. One of the best stouts I’ve had. Up there with Expedition. The one cavaet. This doesn’t have the flavor profile of an imp stout, so the 9% alcohol comes through maybe a little more than it should, if this had been 7/5 or even 8% I think the balance would have been perfection. As it is this is a fanastic beer.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"

Pours jet black with a creamy, dense, tan head of one-inch.
Several arching smears of lacework reveal as the beer drinks and a solid surface coat sustains.

Roasted malts, nougat, cloves and citrus lead off the nose. Mildly sweet and plenty chocolaty, with a substantial orange marmalade essence. A hint of red wine follows through. Dark rum and raisins. An interesting blend of fruit, chocolate, and vineousity.

Creamy and velvety mouthfeel. On the thick side of medium and a bit chewy.

Milk chocolate, citrus-spiked rum, and sugar-dusted bubblegum lead off the pallet. 
Some mild vineous notes follow through along with dried cherries,plump raisins, clove-spiked bannana, and estery yeast.

Finishes warming and sweetish with some lingering chocolate.

A really interesting take on a stout, and the De Dolle yeast really shines through. Tastes more along the lines of a strong dark Belgian rather than a stout. A lot of complexity for a five year old brew","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

I have never seen a head like this before. Even poured gently, it creates a ridiculous amount. There are some strong dark fruit notes in the nose with some weird  abrasive tinges that reminds me of tequila, and I absolutely hate tequila. Other aromas like some cocoa and toffee are noticeable. But man, that tinge is strong. As soon as the brew hits the tongue, head just explodes again. Its very carbonated and slightly oily. Sourness is instantly apparent as some espresso notes appear. Sourness seems to not to be as attributed to many fruits. Its more like a candy sourness, like a warhead. There are notes of darker fruits in here as well. The intense carbonated action on the tongue is a bit distracting, though. As the brew passes the tongue, a sweet toffee complements the explosion of cocoa and roasted coffee notes. The finish is mildly dry. The finish is strong and actually quite good. This is interesting, but there are so many things in this brew thats just bugging me.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

1955,"2008-03-22",4.1,"3/22/2008:  De Dolle Special Extra Export Stout pours an extremely murky brown/dark brown color and has a large fluffy tan head the collapses slowly.  The aroma is quite pungent and contains some kind of fruit/berry (blackberry mixed with dark cherry?) covered in chocolate and caramelized sugar, cream, and some yeastiness.  Actually, maybe it isnt so much berry as it is a very deep, dark red wine (Merlot?) characteristic which a smidge of butterscotch/tanin-like quality.  The flavor begins slightly sweet with semi-sweet and dark chocolate and deeply caramelzing malt and then transitions to a fruity, port-like flavor with some hazelnut-wine and earthiness coming though and then finishes dry with notes of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee.  The flavor has many complex layers and the alcohol content provides a nice warming quality.  This beer has a medium body, an average level of carbonation, and a good lingering flavor of hazelnut wine fortefied with neutral grape spirits (kind of reminds me vaguely of ""Oro"" made by Samson Estate Vinyard in Washington state) with bit of beer-like bitterness.

1955,"2008-03-13",3.1,"Abundance of carbonation is apparent upon opening because it slightly gushed over the lip of the bottle.  The beer poured a black with a large tan head that was unstable and thus dissipated.  Aroma is bitter chocolate and licorice, upon the first sniff it seemed to be estery and spicy, with rich roasted notes as well.  But the aroma was never quite the same.  Kind of vinous with alcohol and licorice.  The flavor is okay, but I expected better.  Its lacking the maltiness and richness.  Flavor is just kind licorice and bitter chocolate, but because of the carbonation, it can never quite sit on the tongue right to allow the flavors to sit right on your tongue.  This being said the mouth feel is over carbonated for a stout, and is thus thin, again making the beer lack a rich feeling.  My least favorite De Dolle beer, but its still not awful.","Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, USA","jehoey"

With only a soft and gentle pour this stout created a glass full of thick tanned foam and took several minutes before it turned into a liquid pitch black.

Wow, either my tastes have changed or I got a starkly different bottle this time around, maybe much younger or something. I actually think both.

Well, as it sat and I got up the nerve to attempt to finish it, a wonderful thing happened.  It got better.  The burnt metal taste gave was to an odd smokey oak flavor, roasted malt and a touch of chocolate...non of which I could discern at all in the beginning...along with a sour finish that Im not sure I liked.

The espresso and hazlenut flavours really pop in the finish with a roasty bitter lingering.

1955,"2008-01-13",4.0,"Pours opaque black into the glass, with a huge tan head that retains nicely to thick lace.  The nose is very vinous in nature, but some chocolate notes hint through the bouquet.  There is a nice, tart fresh cherry upfront, backed with hinted roasts and chocolate notes.  These notes appear later in the pull, and the Belgian Candi Sugar helps ""ground"" the brew from being completely citric in nature.  Sours round out the finish, with an effervescent espresso ""hint"".  There is a nicely integrated note of alcohol, although subtle, mingling toward the back-palate.  With the fruity nature of this, the mouthfeel is vivacious, yet controlled.  It feels full and satiating, and would make for a nice nightcap.  Im not getting quite the lauded coffee/choco/espresso contingencies that others laud in the finish.  I pick up much more vinous and cherry/raspberry sours here, ""mingling"" with dark chocolates and possible (but slight) coffee hints.  To give credit, these do come to fruition more as the brew warms, but so do the dark fruit and sour notes.

Perhaps I got a bad bottle, and Ill give it the benefit of the doubt, but this is not what I was hoping for from such a highly-ranked beer.","USA","keithw"
1955,"2007-12-01",3.6,"12/1/07, 2005 vintage. pours very dark brown with foamy biege head that falls a few minutes but remains thin. nose is a little sour, a clear de dolle house quality to it, hints of roast, hazelnut chocolate, and raisins. flavors are pretty sour, citrus, slightly funky at first but this quickly fades into a roasty, bakers chocolate, and musty. really interesting de dolle yeast coming through in a yeasty and dry finish. alcohol is not detected at all. thin to med. body. sort of a fizzy mouth feel. perhaps some age has soured this a bit and dried it out. more along the lines the JP stout or a black saison than your typical english/american stout. interesting stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Flavor is very musty, and fairly tart. If it werent for some of the other reviews, I would think that I had a bad bottle. Other than that, there is just a hint of coffee and bitter bakers chocolate underneath. Palate is medium, and viscous, with some chocolate lingering in the background.

1955,"2007-11-22",3.9,"The 11.2 ounce bottle poured an almost perfectly black opaque beverage with a thick, creamy tan colored head that was fully lasting and it left great lacing on the glass. The aroma had a nice balance with the malt aspect coming out on top. There was dark chocolate, molasses, and hints of dark fruit and coffee abounding. There is also an odd nose of dust or earth almost hidden. The body was medium-full with soft carbonation and a creamy smooth texture. The flavor starts out somewhat sweet on the palate and stays that way throughout the moderately long finish. There is noticeable alcohol warmth toward the end as well. My feeling is that this one might benefit from being cellared for a year or two.","Wichita, Kansas, USA","henry3r"

The aroma is complex and consists of two-levels: the first that hits me is the deep chocolate and yeast that hits the nose like a wall. The second is the lighter topside, which features the yeasts and light hops... great! Similar to Dogfish Heads stout, but without the DFHs unique yeast character. The flavor is very different from the dogfish head... lots of dry and bitter hops on the front, melting away into burnt caramel, coffee and burnt honey.

Taste is something else. At first quite numbing, some rotten fruit, it then goes to coffee and small blck candy we call drop - toffee. It kind of stays there, I dont know why people mention chocolate, I dont feel it ever goes there.

1955,"2007-10-09",3.9,"Most of these De Dolle beers have entirely too much head!  When it finally settles to a managable level, you have a huge, tan, frothy, fluffy head with good longevity and minimal lacing; body is black and opaque.  Nose is nice but nothing too special; dark chocolate, dry coffee, restrained roast, burnt caramel, and faint molasses.  Flavor is similar with dark chocolate, light coffee, hazlenut, molasses, and a peculiar sour note.  Palate is medium, velvety, round soft to lively, and dry.  Finishes dry and a bit chaulky with the sour notes  vanishing and leaving a decent bitterness from expresso notes; other notes of molasses and a slight anise tinge.  Actually quite nice, somewhat complex, not too dry for the style, and fairly drinkable at 9%.  The sour note just didnt mix well with the everything; I wish it would have either been more pronounced and complex or non-existant.

Oak, vanilla, and hints of anise add complimentary scents.  The flavor is very dry and roasty, with chocolate malts and coffee kissed by vanilla laden French oak.  The sour yeast is present throughout, and when combined with obviously high carbonation level it makes for a lively mouthfeel.  Medium body with a roasty, slightly sour finish.

Oddly enough the sour component isnt offenive at all, just very surprising. I can feel it on the back sides of my tongue. The roast componenet is so pronounced I cant taste much of anything else at this point. Nuances of bitter cocoa, dried dark fruits, bubblegum dust essence, cassis, black currant. The hops really stand out. As the brew warms the flavors really start to come forward. The sour turns to tart black cherries and unerripened stone fruit. Fairly dry if only fainty fruity.

The taste is chocolate, with coffee and nut characteristics thrown in.  An incredibly well-crafted brew whose smoothness belies both the power and the alcohol content of the beer.  De Dolle is one of my favorite breweries, and this does not the least bit disappoint.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"

Pretty much what I was expecting here.  The taste is very similar to the smell.  You get the light sweetness and sourness right up front, but it slowly turns to roast and some chcolate in the finish and coats the palate with some roasty malt flavor in the aftertaste.  The alcohol is masked quite brillinatly actually.  Really interesting beer, not something I want to drink all the time, but a truly enjoyable beer once in a while.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

The beer is very carbonated, and not thick at all. The chocolate flavor is also coming out nicely. I am surprised about the palate.

1955,"2007-06-29",3.5,"An interesting beer to say the least. Quite different from the standard American take on stouts. Aroma was chocolatey, some toffee, subtle roasted coffe and malt notes too. Underneath it all was an odd fruity/apple like character that seemed to lurk around the entire time. Appearance was dark, but it carried some dark brown notes around the edges. Huge eruptive dark tan head too. Took awhile for it to reduce to drinkable status. Mouthfeel was on the thin side of things. Nothing bad, just..pedestrian. Flavor was something different, although Im not sure Id find myself longing for it after Ive consumed the whole bottle. Chalky chocolate on the palate with a sour funkyness that, although different, I didnt really like in my stout. Plus the alcohol hit ya like a freight train. Nothing really complex, and aside from this one occasion I doubt I will retry unless its at a tasting. Too many other great stouts to try.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

1955,"2007-06-15",4.1,"Pours a dark brown/near black with a khaki colored head that would have been huge if I didnt pour it so carefully.  After much glass swirling and letting the beer sit, the carbonation is finally drinkable levels to support the flavors.  Aroma goes through a few temperature transitions, cause it was very odd at first, but now its sweet and very vinous.  Theres some clove and yeast funk for sure, a little ginger, milk chocolate and vanilla for sweetness all held by this vinous winey note.  Nice!  Sweet dark chocolate, plummy raisiny flavor with plenty of spicy yeast funk.  Finishes with the taste of a nice sweetened lightly roasted coffee, just a pinch of licorice and some buttery hop flavor.  Mouthfeel was way overly carbonated at first, but that was easily released.  Otherwise its medium and very creamy.  I have to say this was kind of strange at first, but sip it slow!  It gets better as it warms, moreso than other beers that do the same.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
1955,"2007-06-02",1.8,"I found this beer so repugnant I poured it out. The first problem was extreme overcarbonation, such that i couldnt get it properly into a glass, and eventually was forced to suck foam. Worse was the taste. I like sour beers like Flemish reds. And I like dark, bitter stouts. But I didnt like this creepy combination of sourness and aspirin-like bitterness, with an alcohol burn to boot. While it smelled OK, I noticed no complexity--just sourness and burntness. It was too thin.

Great cofffee and liquorice notes rise from a slightly sweeter than expected nose.

1955,"2007-04-25",3.7,"Slightly funky, tart, vinous and roasty aroma. Spicy yeast and hops give this a much different take on stout, although there is an underlying peanut brittle base that Ive come to equate with certain PNW stouts. The pour on this is fantastic, with a large, super thick and solid head that seriously goes absolutely nowhere for 10 minutes. Even rising above the top of my snifter, I could tilt the glass 45 degrees and have no spillage. Kick ass!

Flavor is smooth, chalky and roasty, less of the funkiness notable in the aroma -- in fact, none at all. In fact, the flavor is pretty much just that of a normal stout. Surprisingly subdued for a beer of ""imperial"" proportions (9% abv). Nice brew.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

The aroma is very unique for a stout, although this is my first foreign stout so maybe its indicative. Features a very strong licorice aroma, sweet, very very light alcohol, roasted coffee, interesting being a stout coming from Belgium and I think the Arabier yeast has given it a distinct feel to it as well.

Initially fruity, berries, then turns a little musky with a chocolate backbone. Quite spritzy in your mouth, but it still manages to feel creamy. Extremely complex flavour. It kind of feels like a saison/lambic while it is in your mouth (fruity and a touch sour), turning into a nice chocolate stout as you swallow. Berries, chocolate, plums, a touch of coffee. Stunning.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

1955,"2007-01-29",3.8,"Pours a dark dark brown to black, cant see light through it, with a bigass tan head, going down quickly.  The nose is sharp, not just for a stout.  Coffee, chocolate, and alcohol is accompanied by a raspberry-like fruity sharpness.  On the tongue this is, as the description says, lively.  I feel like theres some bacterial cultures in here making this lively, but I still think its a bit fizzy and overcarbonated, though it has a nice body.  The flavors are again a real shocker, sharp like the aroma.  A bit sharp raspberry tartness hits hard.  Theres some slightly creamy lactic chocolate sorts of flavors and licorice in with the roast.  Buttery points come out just before the yogurt-culture like finish.  A little salty.  The lingering aftertaste is again buttery with some lingering roast.  A nice beer, wouldve been nicer with less diacetyl.  Unlike any other stout Ive had.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Is this beer supposed to be like this? Did I get a bad one?? Never had a foreign stout before so Im not sure, but it just seems out of wack to me. Wasnt bad, but Ive had a lot of better stouts.

Also shows loads of fruitiness (cherry, plum) along with a smattering of dried fruit (raisins, figs, dates).  Toasted nuttiness as well.  The overall impression is of a slice of fruitcake with chocolate sauce.  A bit of roastiness behind all of the sweet malts and esters.  It starts out quite fizzy but a few swirls help diminish that back to a lovely creamy soft texture.  Warming intensifies the sweet plumminess.  There is also a touch of tartness on the back of the palate along with some light molasses and roasted barley.  Very unique and quite tasty.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Im picking up molasses, chocolate, prunes and maybe some peat in the background.  Flavor is much more sour than I expected... really tart.  After the initial shock of it all, I kind of like it.

Waiting for the head to fall essentially means that this beer comes with a warm up band. Thick cherries and chocolate on the nose, maybe even a hint of oatmeal or white sugar there, too. Big roast and chocolate and plum notes hit you on the attack, and the body and carb are in the medium range (working harmoniously rather than calling attention to themselves). Unfortunately (unless youre a real lover of the traditions of foreign and dry stouts), theres quite a lot of sour, dry, metallic and chalk business, especially at the end.

Aroma of bitter chocolate and roasty malts, some dusty yeast, juicy raisins and brown sugar.  There is also a bit of licorice (which I dont normally get even when the label or description says so).  You wouldnt think a Belgian yeast would work well with a stout, but so far, it seems to work very well.  With the flavor comes a fair amount more of fruity acidity, and then to mod-high roasty bitterness into a bone dry finish.  I think some vanilla snuck into the flavor as well--otherwise I tasted what I smelled.  Full bodied with high carbonation.

Perhaps this is an infected bottle, but after reading a few pages of reviews, it looks like more than a few others have had the same experience. Out of sheer frustration with the immediate foam-action that occurs when I try to sip this beer, I take a spoon and stir. This creates a massive overflowing head, and wastes about half of the beer. Oh well, at least the remaining half is drinkable. Now that I can actually taste the beer without bubbles attacking my palate, I can detect some nice coffee and dark fruit notes, also a sour note reminiscent of a flemish.

It pours an oily black with a big thick brown head. The scent is surprisingly tart & fruity (not like a stout) with a touch of chocolate candy. This is very different for a stout, in that is has an upfront tartness, almost acidic fruitiness. Then is finishes with an amazing stout character of burnt malts, a grainy mouth feel, and a dark earthy, chewy, espresso/mocha like finish. The finish is GOOD, but the flavors just dont go together. That is why its frustrating. Its almost like having a very tart & sour raspberry chocolate cake where the fruits are too sour, and the chocolate is perfect.

This one actually reminds me of something I just brewed not too long ago...a Belgian Bourbon Oak Imperial Milk Stout without the bourbon, lactose, and oak of course. Looking this up, I found many similarities, in fact, including many of the same malts used, close to the same OG, even used some Nugget hops in the aromatics that came about a total of 53 IBUs(calculated). I used the Westmalle strain that John at John Harvards Wayne gave me. I did use over a pound of lactose though in mine and they used candi sugar.

The huge froth stays present for length before finally fading to keep an impressive quarter inch of smoothed over foam the entire session. The lacing is patchy with globby strings.

Aroma is boldly dark and borderline tarry with a deep molasses draw mixing with a slimming dark fruityness. Notes of a sharp soured yeastyness, black licorice, anise, and chocolate dust make for nice extras. The chocolate picks up more as it sits.

Taste is quite nice; full and lively with dark yet fruity flavors and roasted tidbits of tang thrown into the finish. Figgy, plummy, and whispings of currants, dark orange, prunes, and carob all make nice little spicings and nuances across the palate. Alot of complexity in the flavor department with this one. Keeps a solid malty dark candied tang the whole way through, middle adds a partial stop in yeasty sourness adding to, and leading into the finishing areas with a tad bit of roastyness with a bittering coffee and chocolate backdrop thats just noticeable enough. Nice!

Feel is fairly full upfront and into the middle, only teetering slightly and fading softly into the finish with a delicate texture and body. Well carbonated and active. A fun ride and treat.

Drinkability is only hampered a bit for me from the yeasty sourness that plays out a bit to much in the middle areas for a full quaffing experience. Other then that this is a very soild beer and a nice treat to wrap yourself up in at the end of a long day.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

The sour fruits become more pronounced as the beer warms. The finish is long, bitter and acidic. The mouthfeel is light, due mostly to the lively carbonation. The 9% ABV is well hidden.

Black body with a huge billowy dark khaki head. Aroma of acidic dark fruit, muted malt and very slight notes of dark bitter chocolate. Acidity doesnt really carry over to the flavour, where lots of sweet fruity malt dominates. Light bitterness and a hint of tang in the finis. Very little roast character suits me fine since I usually dont care for it. Medium palate is fairly effervescent. The alcohol is not very noticable in the flavour but it leaves its mark by drying out the mouth and warming the throat a little bit. Quite pleasant.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

The nose is very Belgian with bright cloves, licorice,raisins,  and light caramel sweetness in the aroma. Its all very balanced, though it doesnt smell like a typical stout at all to me.Its been at least two minutes since the pour and the head is still mountainous and firm. Im gonna put this on the counter for a little while. Okay, 10 minutes later the head has gone down to a managable level. Wow, this is amazing stuff. Very spicy and tangy with the whole complex Belgian yeast experience present, yet beneath that is a hearty chocolate/coffee stout. The coffee notes are very much like a good espresso with plenty of bittersweet smokiness apparent. The dry finish is like peanut skins.

Looked fine - black with a fair, lacing head. But the first scent impression was of rubber. In a blind smell test, I would have said I was sniffing a rubber fruit cake served with chocolate cream. There were raisins and milky chocolate, but the dominant aroma was a weird pollyfilla note. In the mouth, it was very thin and fizzy. Molasses and figs upfront and a huge hop finish.

1955,"2006-02-04",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2006 From the bottle.

The head on this beer explodes into my glass like nobodys business. Even pouring directly onto the upper lip, as slow as possible, a huge foamy head fills my tulip glass.

The aroma is red wine, mangos, coffee, and a woody, leafy humus aroma the blends with the fairly strong trace of alcohol that waftes up from the brew. 

The taste is dominated by a strong coffee malt infused with a generous alcohol flavor, with some dark prune, black cherry juice, noticable salted licorice; this is not a particuarly sweet stout. Both the carbonation and the alcohol are strong in the mouthfeel; beyond that the initial feel is almost thin, but becoming buttery on the late side of the palate.

This is a pretty good beer, no doubt about it. Still, at $5.00 for an 11.2 oz bottle, when  Elysian Dragonstooth (which I prefer) is going at $3.50 for 22oz, there is little reason to do this often.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Finishes rather roasty (more than the yeasty nose would suggest), along with anise and coffee. Leathery and astingent near the end as well. Complex, like a sweet virginal pussy (thanks Dan). Alcohol is there, but not overbearing, it provides a nice warming sensation. A bit thin in the mouth, but silky nonetheless with just the right amount of carbonation. This stuff is funky as hell. I dont really know how much more to describe it or categorize it, but De Dolle is on to something here. Its what I call a sleeper beer. It does everything right, and is so nondescript that while drinking it, you dont notice much. But when you look back, you realize your pants are wet and you remember nothing but a great time. Worth a shot.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"

You could curl up and go to sleep on it. Not too sweet and not too bitter. It is beautifully balanced. Lots of (almost too much) liqourice initially which gives way to more coffee and malty chocolate as it warms. There is a touch of something almost floral about it.

I prefer any stout I drink to be somewhat subdued when it comes to fizz and this one is extremely fizzy and violent on the tongue.

Musky roasted malts, clean, clean yeast. Exquisite. Cocoa. Interesting when this one hits the tongue. This is as carbonated as most belgian strong ales are and that really cuts in between the folds of flavor. First a musty roasted grain, then a slight cheddar and sweetness.

1955,"2005-10-02",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2007 It is hard to believe this drink comes from the same womb as its burly brother Still Nacht.  It is far more moderate, pleasing and it doesnt try nearly as hard.  It is a good beer all around, which leaves me with few words to describe it.  The foam is a luscious, capping the beer with a light tan lid.  Theres a lot of alcohol in the smell which makes it difficult for me to procure any subtle aromas.  If they left any clues, I certainly couldnt find them.  The foam itself tastes very dark and salty as if a completely separate flavor from the rest of the beer.  The same idiosyncrasy applies to the beer itself, which takes a wildly different approach from the head and aroma flavor profiles.  There is predominantly licorice, but my beer interpretive skills are still dull and were unable to dig any deeper then the sticky fennel, though there seemed to be considerable mysteries to uncover in the darkest recesses of the Extra Export.  I was pleased with the malts character of the beer and didnt mind the saltiness in the flavor.  Somewhat perturbing was the overbearing alcohol, most especially spoiling in the nose.  Still, nothing to reject the beer for.  This brew warrants further study when my olfactory has better training.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1955,"2005-09-04",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2005 From a 330ml bottle purchased at Torrence Liquors in Calumet City IL. The malt and residual sugars impart a surprisingly sweet fruity aroma for what turns out to be a relatively dry stout; a touch of alcohol in the aroma as well. Pours a dark reddish brown with a fair amount of suspended sediment. Huge pale tan head forms when pouring and eventually dissipates, leaving tightly-packed lace on the sides of the glass all the way to the bottom.  For all the dry roast flavor this beer contains, it is impossibly smooth to drink thanks to the characteristically Belgian candy-sugar sweetness. The same familiar Belgian hop and nutty yeast flavors that are found in classics like Delerium and Duvel find their way into this truly unique stout that is a loving  tribute to the British Isles original while remaining characteristically Belgian. The theoretically divergent features of classic Belgian ale and British stout work surprisingly well together. Of course, one can count on a solid brewery like De Dolle to pull it off. This is my favorite ""standard"" stout yet.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

But, the first sip was something different, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, coffee, hazelnut and a slight tingling from alcohol and licorice (more licorice than alcohol).

The aroma is roasted, milky, with a fruit edge (grapes and raspberry) and a caramel fondue--overall, quite nice, complex, but not everything I wanted.  The flavor warmed gracefully with its substantial dose of alcohol providing many of the added dimensions, though it isnt overbearing and it does offer some raisin and rum-soaked plum notes to the bittersweet chocolate (more of a milk chocolate variant than the 80% cocoa kind).  The palate is always engaging, being frothy for all of its oil and tempered sweetness.  Clearly warming by the end of the bottle.

1955,"2005-06-29",4.0,"33cL bottle at Brick Store Pub.  Poured a deep black with a substantial caramel head.  Espresso, rum, currants, heavy roasted malt, and a whole lot more going on in the nose.  Hoppy bitterness and alcohol were the first flavors to hit the tastebuds, followed by coffee, bakers chocolate, dark fruits, alcohol and spices.  Dry roasty finish carried through many of the above flavors.  This was a complex and well-crafted brew.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1955,"2005-06-29",3.8,"33cl bottle. Poured 3/4 of the bottle  into my NB worthy glass. The beer pours a dark black with a smallish khaki head that grows to a good 2"" tall. The beer laces as the head subsides. The aroma is dark roasted malt, yeast, some chocolate and some lactic sourness. The taste, at first is sweet, malty and chocolaty followed by a roasty, moderately bitter middle with accompaning coffee and caramel? flavors. The finish is dry and moderately roasty with some spicy hops. The mouthfeel is improved when the last of the bottle is added and the yeasty, floury flavor is more apparent. This is a very pleasant beer, but I though De Dolle would make a beer better than the Ellezelloise Hercule I thought it would most closely resemble, but alas, it did not.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter flavor becomes a lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter finish with a perfume dryness.  Medium-full body, creamy/slick texture, fizzy carbonation, moderate alcohol.  Adding the yeast mutes the bitting tart acidity yielding a softer semi-sour acidity.   The bottom line is: a bit more sweetness would go a long way in this beer...even my etched Chimay glass couldnt difuse enough carbonation for my liking...a refreshingly balanced alternative to the over-hopped American big stouts and the malt dominated British Impys.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

1955,"2005-06-03",4.0,"Deelish, and an interesting stout.  Deep brown with a creamy light brown head that coats in sheets as you drink, this has a heavy roasted malt aroma.  Beyond that, theres plenty of dark dried fruits (raisins & prunes & dates, oh my), some yeasty light fruits, a touch of bitterness, and a big whack of alcohol.  All of this translates to the taste quite nicely.  Along with the aforementioned are traces of chocolate, coffee, and anise - but the dark fruitiness and alcohol prevail.

1955,"2005-05-30",4.0,"This is an amazingly interesting beer and not one that would really qualify as a stout by British or American standards. Instead of the coffee and chocolate malts taking center stage in the flavor and aroma, the fruity, spicy yeast takes over in both the flavor and aroma. Apples and their peels dominate the fruit with some support from a bit of mango. The spiciness is somewhere between coriander and mint. The dark malts come through in the finish with a lingering roastiness that is quite pleasant and lacks any harshness. The appearance is appropriate with a black body with dark mahogany around the edges. The large, booming head is a dark tan and slowly shring to a milkfoam layer above the beer.

1955,"2005-03-29",3.9,"Sampled March 2005
As I pour this beer I get aromatic notes of raisins, rum, and figs.  It is quite well carbonated and pours with a light brown head that sits atop a dark black beer.  When I go in for a deeper smell I get rich malty notes intertwined with notes of sherry, and a dry vinous note that reminds me of an earthy red wine.  It is interesting how the aroma of this beer is similar to some rich red wines, I get notes of berries, almost jam like and a rich woody earthiness.

Upon first sipping this beer it literally froth on my tongue from the ample carbonation, so I swirl a bit of it out.  The taste is sweet up front with notes of burnt raisin.  It finishes a bit hot from fermentation by products, which actually form an astringent almost bitter component that helps to balance the sweetness found at the beginning.  This beer is really light on the palate, almost refreshing in character.  I must say I am quite enjoying this beer, there is a nice roast coffee note in the finish that only appears after the beer has been swallowed.  There is a combination of carbonation and yeast derived notes that give this beer a spicy, prickly, and perhaps a hint of a vegetal note.  All in all this is a nice beer that really is quite intriguing and makes for a contemplative, complex tasting beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Head is about an inch thick, big and oatmeal colored, with a grayish tint as well. Smell is strongly of sweet malt: chocolate and concord grapes. Taste is very sweet grapes, anise, alcohol (Nyquil-like), brown sugar. After a few seconds on the tongue, a nice crack of hops smacks the top of the taste buds and reverberates into the throat, leaving some roasted coffee notes with the alcohol sizzle.  Aftertaste is semi-sweet chocolate/ cocoa powder and toffee. Interesting, complex and certainly has the unique foreign stout flavor one should expect.

There is a roasted malt component, a lingering bitter chocolate, perhaps some stale hops to provide a hint of blue cheese tang, and a touch lactic sour in the finish.

This is one that is terribly complex there could with tastes and textures changing many times a second. If one were to guzzle this down, I dont see this getting much more than a 3.3. But now that I am sipping with this one some great qualities come out.  Port, and licorice, deep rich red wine, mild overripe red fruit, brandy and nuts. This really is a snifter brew.

Significant alcohol presence remains blown away by the fruits. taste: A good bite in a roasted toast on which youve added a complicated fruits jam with a chocolate syrup.

Awesome, complex aroma of plum, cherry, prune, toffee, and cinnamon, all embedded in a fresh bread dough matrix.  The flavor was similarly imbued with plum, grape, and soy components, hints of licorice, and plenty of bready yeast.  One part ale and one part red wine.

Rich vanilla, doughy yeast commencement coupled with sharp roastiness and a sassy anise/black licorice grab. Vibrant esters of dark fruit, perfume, and phenols add to the complexity. Remarkably concealed alcohol, with the exception of a rummy-sweet and  peppery demeanor, which dries it out. Relentless yeast push fuses effortlessly with the complex fresh bready malt flavor. Delicate floral hop kiss and doughy yeast elements minimize the sweetness. Dry, vinous alcohol with a chalky malt tinge and outstandingly placed fruity esters. Ends with a slight leathery astringency crossed with a well-rounded roasty finish. Lingering honts of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and tongue coating yeast.

Smells of candysugar, chocolate milk, roasted malt and dry dried fruits (Raisins and prunes) and some alcohol and bourbon. Initial taste catches me like an imperial, though a much lighter body. But, damn, is that alcohol present! Taste all over the place, actively assaulting my tongue, eventually leading to a dry irish coffee finish. In the initial melee, there exists distinct grilled sour fruits, that is to say cherries and blackberries that have been put on the barbecue. Very interesting flavortaste.

This one is a bit hot currently with some alcohol burn.  Also, a bit of sourness which is unexpected in the stout style.  Other flavors include prunes and zesty peppery spiciness.

Once you get pass that there are plum and pear flavors, subdued roasted malts, a hint of mocha before finishing with a smack of bitters and smoke.

The aroma is a rich milky smoked malt offering.  The texture is at first creamy, but then explodes on the tongue with a peppy, undeniably Belgian yeast flavor... spiced bread, chocolate syrup... this certainly is unique.

Bottled at GBBF 2004.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1955,"2004-08-20",4.0,"Bottle. This was a massive stout, very sweet, rich and then bitter. Full on dark chocolate, and roasted malt to start with, thick, almost chewy sweetness. Some powdery chocolate. Some slight citric twang from the hops, but this is totally dominated by the thick bittersweet chocolate flavour. Some raw alcohol shows in the end. Super concentrated and definitely a sipper, really nice, warming.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
1955,"2004-08-09",4.3,"Got my bottle from Liquid Solutions and shared it with Mike from Bon Vivant. My bottle says Special Export Stout. Pours a very dark brown with an overblown tanned head. Aroma is dark fruits (raisins and plums) and some spice in the nose. Maybe some watery chocolate or cocoa. The aroma to me, reminded me of on of the Trappist beers. It was nothing like an American imperial stout. The taste was alcohol, malts, more fruits (raisins and plums), light spice, and light bitterness. Again, nothing like an American stout. Mouthfeel was very full and carbonated. There was some moderate alcohol warming in there as well. Finish was smooth but rather dry. More spice and malts with the Trappist thing going on. If someone gave me a glass without knowing what it was, I would have picked Westy 12 or Rochefort 10. Not a bad thing but this seems different than what everyone else has had based on the few ratings I see for it. I picked up a few other bottles so Ill have to revisit this again soon. Great beer, by the way.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1955,"2004-08-08",4.5,"Eclipse black color. Very large sized tan colored head. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, fruit, floral and yeasts. A medium to full bodied stout. Malts are coffee, chocolate and roasty. Yeasts are bright and touch funky (must and leather). Interesting beer, it most definitely a stout, but its also definitely Belgian in origin and style. Makes for a very interesting combination. Touch of alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1955,"2004-08-03",4.2,"Such an amazing brewery. Pours a thick black with a tall tan head that is so thick it stands above the rim of the glass and leaves some great lacing while you drink. Aroma is nice and roasty with a good chocolate aroma that fits this beer very well. Taste is very malty and roasty with chocolate and a bit of coffee, very thick mouthfeel with a bit of belgian spice in the aftertaste.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1955,"2004-08-01",3.7,"Nice black color,small tan head that had a short hangtime then faded to a small lace.The aroma was malty and with hints of chocolate and maybe some light hints at coffee but that might be pushing it a bit.The flavor was pretty good,with a nice malty side some fruit possibly dried fruit with a light hop presence,some caramel and a hint of chocolate in there as well.A bit on the heavy side for my taste but over all a decent brew that would be a nice change from all the other macros ive been sampling lately.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
1955,"2004-07-27",3.6,"Black body with just a hint of red, topped by big beige head.  Aroma is moderately sweet, roasty, cookie dough, chocolate, alcohol, some caramel, light grape.  Taste is rich, chocolate, cookie, molasses, caramel, some vinous.  Finish is strong alcohol warming.  Thick, full body.  Great individual characteristics present, but they dont add up to a beer I love -- I think the alcohol detracts here.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1955,"2004-07-26",1.9,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2013 Bottle (bottled Feb 2013). Head is initially large, frothy, light brown, fully lasting. Body is hazy dark brown to black, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty (roasted grain), with strong notes of sour apple/cherry/lemon and balsamic vinegar. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.  Both of the last two batches (Feb 2013 and Mar 2012) were completely infected and undrinkable. Poor DDB has lost its way, sadly.  This was a 4+ brew for me when it first came out.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1955,"2004-06-02",3.4,"Draught. Dark brown coloured. There is not much stout about this. It is more like a normal strong Belgian ale. Malty, fruity and slightly roasty. Bitter finish.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"
1955,"2004-04-07",3.9,"Tap, ZBF March 2004.  Muddy dark brown, moderate creamy beige head and good condition.  Good blend of sweet yeastiness and intense coffee/roast barley in the nose, quite fruity in the mouth with hints of liquorice, roast barley and some trace phenols. Intense bitter roastiness returns in the finish with some yeast again noticable. Not quite an Imperial stout but certainly Belgian.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
1955,"2004-03-24",3.1,"Dark brown with a small head. The aroma is doughy and reminds me of banana cake. The taste is sharp light roasted but not that bitter. This is not a normal stout. The 'normal' coffee and chocolade tastes are missing.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
1955,"2004-03-18",3.9,"A black beer with a fine light brown head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of roasted bread. The flavor is rather complex on a background of alcohol it contains prunes, plums, roasted bread, and bitter coffee - before it ends on a dry bitter hop note. A very nice beer.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1955,"2004-03-06",3.4,"Dark brown, fully hazy; yellowish head, fast gone. Slightly smoked, faint chocolate nose. Very burnt taste, lots of restsweetness, but mainly burnt-bitter. Full bodied, chewy even. It's a stout on demand. I do not like Belgian stouts in general, so in its' style it's OK. The US may have it.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
