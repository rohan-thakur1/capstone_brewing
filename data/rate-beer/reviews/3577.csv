3577,"2017-02-17",2.3,"Draft sample at the source. The beer was a gold color with a white head of foam. Good head retention. The aroma has doughy, bready notes with some spice and fruity bits coming through. As the beer warms, it becomes one of the most popcorn forward beers Ive ever had. It became very off-putting. Judging by the previous reviews, I must have gotten a bad batch. Tasted 2/16/2017.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
3577,"2016-05-17",3.9,"Cool beer as expected. Despite the lemony fruit forwardness of the kumquat, a very well balanced gose. you got it all. refreshingly tart, slight spice and salt. If there wasnt just a hint of lemon pledge in the nose itd have scored even higher.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
