1909,"2016-03-29",3.7,"Hopplukker - does this name already tells me all I need to know about this beer?
Mine was bottles 3/2015, so due to the brewer at the end of its shelf life. Still it pours wonderfully dark apricot, hazy for sure but no visible sedimentation and offers a creamy, off white head of exemplary stability.
Unfortunately a very slight oxidation ruins the hop aroma. Even the subtle piney peaks cant get through it as it should. Im afraid this one was badly stored before I got it three weeks ago. Will compare soon with a new one :-)
The flavor still has it all! A hop cocktail, tailored to please and discover and not to glue your tongue with bitterness. The malt body perfectly balances the fruity hop notes. Both are well integrated into the body of this well rounded beer. 
So coming back on my initial question if the name already tells me all? Nope! There is much more than simply hops ;-)","Vught, NETHERLANDS","TheFoamhead"
