3871,"2016-12-09",3.7,"From cask at The Lazy Bulldog pub Athens. Hazy amber with white head. Fresh hoppy and green aroma with a hint of scallion. Bitter, danky and dry. Medium body, mildly carbonated, long bitter, green and hoppy finish. Very good, cask sure does wonders here.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","kerenmk"
3871,"2016-12-08",3.9,"Pours into a cognac snifter. White, soapy head, and a rather consistent one, which dissipates quite swiftly, retaining a half-finger ring till the end. Golden translucent colour.

The aroma is a ""green"" bombardment: pine, spices, grass, escorted by passion-fruit (mostly), mango (notes), and pineapple (hints). The hop sensation is all over the place...

The taste is clearly bitter, but not overwhelmingly, with a light body. Again here, the coniferous essence is prevalent: pine, herbs, hemp, which are more intense than the fruity nuances of grape-fruit. When our brew is totally warmed up, tones of bubblegum and sesame (!) are making their subtle way out. Extremely drinkable, and with a lasting aftertaste! A fine west-coast example of an IPA! Menace up the greek craft scene...","GREECE","Ale_Hunter_666"

3871,"2016-11-28",4.3,"Review based on 3 bottles drank at home in Belgium.
This beer is all about the aroma. Exploding out of the glass is a combo of grapefruit zest / lemon sorbet on top of thicker musky notes of pine resin / roasted green tea. The mosaic galaxy combo is killer and this beer is a beautiful showcase of why these hops are the hottest around at the moment.
Body is thin and dry as expected with considerable bitterness. It is aggressively balanced but not over the top. This beer bests some of the IPAs currently in the overall top 50 of which I have had quite a few. Very impressed!","BELGIUM","jdebonth"

3871,"2016-11-24",4.2,"On tap at The Lazy Bulldog. I solemnly sware to the God of Hops, this is the best Greek IPA Ive ever had. Full of fruity and grassy aromas, great kick of hoppiness, but also well balanced with caramel malty notes. Pours hazy orange with thick white head and somehow oily finish. Surprisingly good lacing, light to medium mouthfeel, slightly citrusy bitter aftertaste, fair carbonation. Words are not enough to express my enthusiasm. I had three pints, one after the other. Kicks serious ass!!","Athens, GREECE","Brew_Cat"
