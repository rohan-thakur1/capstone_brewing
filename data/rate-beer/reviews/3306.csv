3306,"2013-03-02",3.9,"Würziger, leicht karamelliger Antrunk. Geringe Süße, spritzig, leichte Herbe ab dem Mittelteil. Süffig getreidiger Abgang, malzig, vielleicht etwas zu trocken. 12/12/12/10//12","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"
3306,"2013-02-26",3.9,"Draught at Posterer, November 2012: Ruddy orange. Sticky white halo of foam. Supremely delicate and soft nose of spice cake, wooden hops (sassafras, earth), apricot marmalade, cookie, toasted bread, and a touch of honeysuckle. Initially firm with a healthy dose of minerals and crisp cookie backed with herbaceous, fennel-tinged hop bitterness and fluffy spicy cake. Pronounced yeasty bite coincides beautifully with the snappy mineral scrubbing action. Copious amounts of bouncy and juicy melanoidin fills the palate with appealing massaging textures and beautify the slick and zesty marmalade lusciousness. Looming caramelized sugar and candied pecan ""grip"" beneath the softer malt. Pervasively honeyish. Finishes well-attenuated yet earthy and fully malty with herbal hop echoes to induce appetite and temper the sugars. After spending some time with the style, zoiglbier can often seem a bit redundant, as the variability  from to the next tends to be negligible. That said, I would be a happy man if this were my everyday quaffer. Might be a bit straightforward, but its yet another clean and slammable example with exemplary malt structure.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
