1181,"2015-11-16",4.2,"750 mL growler. Originally reviewed 8/10/2012.

Very hazy orange. Small white head. Light, but almost contiguous layer of foam remains atop the beer. Surprisingly leggy as I swirl it.
 A two-faced smell. First aroma is a gigantic pineapple and mango flavor. Almost like theres mango juice in it. Sweet smelling. Behind it is a distinct grapefruit pungency. Almost as if there are two glasses of beer in front of me and Im smelling both at the same time.

The flavor lacks a bit of the depth the aroma has. The flavors blend better, but they are also a touch diminished. The grapefruit is more dominant than the tropical fruits and the grapefruit becomes much more dominant in the finish. Builds to a strong bitter grapefruit finish.
 Low-ish carbonation. Probably due to the growler. Medium body. The bitterness is extreme, though, much like Society & Solitude #3. Like chewing on a grapefruit in the end.
 Delicious, even if abrasive in the finish.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

Le nez est superbe, cest doux, aucune trace dalcool, un peu de résineuse mais rien dintense. En bouche, encore un party exotique. Le citra prend plus de place ici. Beaucoup dagrumes: tangerine, orange, pamplemousse rose. Le Galaxy lui se colle au palais et apporte une sensation plus sucré de pêche et melon deau. La finale laisse place au côté plus amer des houblon mais toujours sur un fond dagrumes. Une agréable texture moyennement mince, un corps assez rond et une amertume juste à point, une carbonation un peu trop intense au début mais qui se stabilise par la suite.

1181,"2015-07-09",4.5,"Location: Growler from the brewery, 7/9/15


Aroma: It is tropical hop dominated, grapefruit, mango, peach, some pine, and a little greenery

Appearance: Bright, almost glowing orange color, cloudy, with a lasting sheet of frothy white head

Flavor: Tastes fruity and a little sweet, with a nice, hoppy, mid-bitterness from mid-palate to finish

Palate: Has a smooth, softness that makes it so drinkable, finishes with a perfect dryness

Overall Impression: 
Enjoyed this more from the growler than I did when I only had the small sample at the brewery. We are talking a jump from great to really great here, so thats pretty impressive. Didnt love it quite as much as I did the Double Citra, but its pretty close. I keep giving these beers such high scores. Im making a point to not take the brewery name into account, but damn if the beers arent completely worthy of these scores. Excellent.  Way too drinkable for an 8% beer.  Drinks great.

Retention is still quite high.Straightorward citra in the nose show lemon, lemon oil, orange rind and soft grapefruit notes while the galaxy does its weird thing, though less so in combination with the citra, providing a hybrid stone fruit-tangerine thing and yet also a leafy, nearly spicy star fruit-like juiciness. A touch of dullness, maybe from yeast, maybe from hop and not quite the unendingly juicy/tropical sniffable-ness of some of the very best DIPAs (though still nothing to scoff at). Cracker and white bread provide backdrop, nicely dry and with very light suggestions of honey and wheat-like softness. No alcohol and shockingly hard to tell apart from their lower gravity pale ales.Starchy, sparse, bready malts are very, very dry and are heavily laced with bitterness, though the juiciness from both hops shows up quickly to quell any dissension. Tangerine, grapefruit, lime, cherryskin and unripe mango all join the party, very flavorfully, while little/no trace of resin or overly bitter hoppiness ever re-emerges. Heavily dextrnous/full-bodied mouthfeel is the only thing that tips off the drinker to the higher gravity, as alcohol, sweetness and heavy bitterness are nowhere to be found.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours murky apricot orange with thick white foam that sticks around for quite some time. The nose really opens as it warms - peach, mango, dank, some pineapple and resin. Nice nose - not too sweet, which is norm as of late. Flavor is bitter and grainy with plenty of nuances. Pine, grapefruit rinds, some lemon and grains. Im surprised and refreshed at how bitter this is. Medium bodied and moderated carb. Nice beer, Im betting this is a step higher up at the brewery fresh as possible. I think the peach and mango would be stronger and really make this one.

How: Fresh 750ml growler consumed the day of purchase
The look: Cloudy blond body topped by a small white head
In long: Nose is an explosion of all kinds of fruits, peaches, pineapples, grapefruits, passion fruits, more  Something about the interaction of Galaxy and Citra but I almost didnt any of the cat urine I usually get from Citra IPAs.  Taste has the Hill Farmstead IPA malt signature that Ive come to describe as soft fresh baguette with some pale crackers.  Theres a little sweetness sensation at first (candied dried fruits and sweet bananas) but quickly the hops take over.  Extremely tasty hops with a superb fresh fruitiness character.  Flavorful bitterness that is never too aggressive.  This 9% Double IPA is dangerously sessionnable.  Bitterness of medium intensity that sticks around for a long time blending with an after taste of tropicals fruits, bananas and why not a side of fruit salad.  Usual Hill Farmstead full bodied mouthfeel with plenty of very soft bubbles, very enjoyable to keep in the mouth.  All similar but all different, Hill Farmstead keeps pumping some of the best IPAs on the planet.

Pours a cloudy tangerine yellow-orange.  A finger of resilient, creamy white head sticks around.  

Riper-than-ripe juicyfruit nose.  Unbelievable tropical fruit, mango, tangerine, lemon citrus, pineapple, maybe a hint of green leafy bitterness.  Bright, bitter, and brilliant.

More of the same.  A citra bomb on the front of the palate, beaming citrus and pineapple, playing right into galaxys passionfruit/tropical fruit brilliance.  Mango juice.  This beer sweats more juicy, fruity bitterness than other beers are made of.  Resinous finish.  Just enough sweetness to pull this back from the too-bitter.  

Creamy; medium, medium light bodied.

1181,"2012-08-26",4.0,"Shared from a growler. Poured a light hazy golden-yellow color with a white head. Aroma was plenty of grapefruit, hops, with notes of sweet malts. Flavor was a nice tropical fruit hop mix with nice sweet malts. Very nice mouth feel, bitterness is balanced pretty well, plenty of nice hop character to it.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
1181,"2012-08-21",4.0,"750mL growler, sent from Glouglouburp (thanks a lot, Dany!). Pours a cloudy golden / blond with a small white head. Aroma is heavenly, with loads of piney and citrusy hops, balanced by lots of biscuity malt. Flavour is very citric upfront, with the tropical fruits following revealing notes of passionfruit and mango, among others - the finish is again very citrus hop heavy and very bitter. Though not one of my favourites by them due to the slightly harsh astringency, yet another excellent IIPA from Hill Farmstead.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1181,"2012-08-21",3.2,"Growler... Cloudy golden ale with a small, creamy, white head. Good retention. The aroma is bursting-at-the-seams with an assortment of  citrus and tropical fruits - passion fruit really stands out. Medium-bodied with soft carbonation. The flavor leans way bitter, really showcasing those high alpha Citra hops. Lengthy, bitter finish as well. Growler courtesy of landhoney!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1181,"2012-08-20",4.0,"packs a wallop but lets you down gently. just poured myself the dregs of a growler...this baby looks like the beers that moe pours on the simpsons.  tastes like a nice pine forest but decently balanced for such a haughty flavorful IPA.","Massachusetts, USA","hammerslammer"
1181,"2012-08-18",3.9,"750mL Bottle. Catty, piney alcoholic raw greeness. The aroma does rise up and kiss me like HFs other Double IPAs. A nip of raw garlic and onion comes through. Theres a slight astringency and a slight dusty quality to the bitterness that shaves a few points off the top. Im also not getting into the hint of green onion that comes through. Feels drier and less bitter. The alcohol is really warm for the beer, somehow. Still very good, leaps and bounds above most Double IPAs, but in my opinion, not as good as the other HF Double IPAs Ive had.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1181,"2012-08-18",3.8,"grouuuwwwwler.   lugged all the fucken way back from vinnie testeverde knows where.   big potent bitter dank resin, spruce, and bright pine needles.  much more astringent than typical HF hoppy beers. also some bitter grapefruit.   wet hops.   dry mouthfeel.   clean.    def hop forward.    prefer a bit more balance.   leaves a dry resin pine note in the mouth.    good, but definitely preferred the society and solitude 1 and 3, which were more balanced.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"

1181,"2012-08-14",4.0,"Thanks to Deuane for grabbing me a growler of this one from the brewery.

A - Pours hazy golden orange with a dense two finger tall white head leaving sticky rings of lace down the entire glass.

S - Smells of fresh citric fruit zest, pungent hops, fresh cut grass, pine needles and some light caramel malt sweetness.

T - Starts off with a ton of hop bitterness that lasts through the finish. The galaxy and citra hops work well together but they are hard to tell them apart at times. Hints of citric fruit zest, grass and pine as well as some sweet caramel help round things out. The finish is quite bitter, lingering on the palate long after the finish.

M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Lots of bitterness throughout with a dry finish, no alcohol detectable at all.

O - A very good DIPA yet again from Hill Farmstead. Not as good as some of their other hoppy beers but it was still a very enjoyable, easy drinking beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
1181,"2012-08-14",4.2,"On tap at Three Penny Tap Room, Montpelier VT.  Golden, sunny aroma of kiwi, pineapple and mango with a certain earthiness to it thats darkly sweet, and pungent.  Theres a lot of the same stone-fruitiness in the flavor, imbued heavily with weed, green and fragrant and cloudy; malt is comfortably present, lightly flavored but tightly packed.  Alcohol lends a mild sheen to the palate which is rich, but still crisp; finishes smoothly, with a sticky, dandelion flavored bitterness.  A fine example of complicated simplicity; lowish alcohol, herbal/tropical hop combo, light but substantive malt.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1181,"2012-08-14",4.3,"On draft at Hill Farmstead Saison Festival in the retail shop, consumed as soon as it was filled. Beautiful cloudy amber-orange pour with a vivacious frothy white head. Nose and flavor really bring both of the blended beers out, with that beautiful biting lemon zest and grassy Citra character mixing with a more approachable, nectary Galaxy character, though big piney dankness comes through as well. Obscenely drinkable, as usual for Shaun, for a double IPA. Perfect crisp carbonation, but not so effervescent as to hide the complexity of the mix. Outstanding.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Medium mouthfeel.  Flavor has upfront citrus tart note, then the finish has a strong and somewhat astringent hop bite.  It lets you know that its a double.  Even though it doesnt really taste like a double.  Its very deceiving.  Thanks again Mike.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"

Pours a moderate peach color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing.  Nose has heavy citrus and tropical notes. Mango big in the flavor, followed by heavy bitterness. Touch of passion fruit.

The aroma was not over powering but nice nonetheless with some lemon and grapefruit. Medium and rich on your palate. Flavors were excellent with some pineapple, peach alongside an earthy grassy quality. Cool combo of the two hop characteristics. Finish of course long, dry without being harsh or overly bitter or palate killing. Good beer.","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
1181,"2012-07-22",4.0,"750ml Growler drank the same day and 1 week later. The fresh growler was more fruity and had more carbonation. I didnt notice any major differences. Appearance: Deep opaque orange with thick white head. Aroma: Tropical fruits (orange, pinneaples) at first, then there is a rustic touch, wood, dank and grass. Taste: Very bitter, some spicy hops, a nice citrus tartness cuts through the bitterness and accentuates drinkability. Full bodied and very dry. Nice mix between rustic and fruity, quite complex. An average Hill Farmstead double IPA, awesome nonetheless.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

Flavor is pine, resin, citrus zest (somewhat pithy) mixed tropical fruit and the malt is just there to add to the complexity. Good bitterness. Super drinkable.  This is a top notch IIPA, however it is also my least favorite from Hillfarmstead.
