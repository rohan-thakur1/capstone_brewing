4302,"2014-05-30",3.2,"This is classified as a pilsener on this site as of May 2014. It is a bit dark for that--more of an orange than yellow or golden--but the taste is kind of close I suppose. Id say this resembles a cheap American lager as much as anything. and a good one at that. (I am a fan of the style so do not mean for that to be a backhanded complement.) It is crisp w/ just a touch of toffee like malts w/o being thick or sweet. The carbonation borders on being too vigorous but as it is it works pretty well and helps keep the palate crisp.

Pours golden with a solid sheet of fine white foam, a little dark for the style. Smells of apple, grain, crsytal malt, some sweet corn and some bits of bitter, noble hops. Taste is smooth with some apple juice, some metal, some grain and bits of white grape juice over hay and standard lager flavors. Thin with low carb and a semi dry yet wet finish. An okay beer, very drinkable but lacks the assertiveness and lightness a fine pilsner should have. This is a lager, but not a pilsner.

Aroma has some sweet biscuity malts with some lightly herbal grassy hops behind.  Flavor adds some light hay, otherwise the same lightly sweet biscuit malt.  Not crazy hoppy, but enough for a nice balance (plus I didnt drink this as early as I could have).  Bitterness peaked at a 3 in the dry finish.

4302,"2012-06-10",3.8,"A pour into a tulip glass reveals a clear amber color, topped with a full two-fingers of fluffy and creamy white head. The head sticks around for the party with good retention and tons of lacing.

Clean and crisp. Very nice balance between bready caramelized malts, lager yeast and some hops.  Theres a little bit of both with a sweetness that may be more dominate.  Maybe just a subtle hint of honey sweetness and citrus.

Soft and subtly sweet caramel malt, nutty, toasted grain, and a hint of floral hops. The malts really pop at the front, with just a hint of sourness lingering around the edges. The hops take over in the second half, providing some acidity and just a gentle bite of bitter at the end.  Made in the style of a pilsener, there is not going to be anything to knock the socks off of most beer drinkers aside from the smoothness.  Balance, balance, balance.

This is the one weakness I could find in this beer. Fairly benign mouthfeel; it has reasonable crisp but lacks a certain flair. It also seems a little thin. Finishes clean. I would have liked a bit more carbonation and body.

Well New Glarus managed to knock me over with a feather again. Tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of the style. Another fine session beer with flavor and substance. Again, me only knock would be the thin mouthfeel.","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

Not a bad lager, but I wouldnt put this in my top 5 New Glarus brews.  If it wasnt in the variety pack, I wouldnt seek it out on its own.

Re-rate:  I tried it again just to make sure I wasnt selling it short.  Unfortunately I had the opposite reaction and lowered some of my scores.  Maybe I just dont enjoy style and that factors into my rating.  But for me, this just tasted like a run of the mill lager.  Nothing special and Ive had much better.  Its too bad.

I would rank it higher than the Spotted Cow but lower than the Fat Squirrel, but I think that it really because I am more of a fan of darker brews anyway. With that being said, there are some good things Two Women has going for it - chief among them being its smoothness.

Big, white head of fthe pour that lasts and laces the glass.  Malt body, and low hops.

4302,"2011-10-18",3.0,"In short: A disappointing grassy lager with way too much apple juice.  Meh.
How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed very fresh the day I received it from oakbluff soon after the 2011 release.  Thanks Scott
The look: Clear golden body topped by a short-lived white head
In long: The beer starts with an interesting nose of dried yellowed grass with a spicy edge that screams Saaz and probably some other noble hops.  But theres something wrong with the taste.  Lots of breakfast apple juice, a light tartness that doesnt work with the beer, soapy notes, spicy herbal notes, strong citric notes, not really dry, not really bitter.  Finish is spicy grass in a glass of apple juice.  Unlike DVDs, beer is an adult product that I dont like it even if it has Two Women in the name.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

They have enough spark to keep you mildly interested. Unfortunately, I wasnt ready to commit to having another drink with them.  The idea of a Country Ale sounded nice and unfiltered, yet the flavor was surprisingly tame.  This one is good for a mainstream taster, pleasant and typical.

Flavor has a fairly nice bitter hop presence but retains an odd sweetness.   Malt notes of biscuits, crackers, bread.  Definitely, its missing out on the crispness and dryness of the R&D version.  It seems the mouthfeel differs to, because what I remember as a effervescent and lively mouthfeel is muted and bordering almost on soft carbonation.  Its a great beer, dont get me wrong.

This brew pours quite carbonated into a pils glass; unfortunately the head nearly disappears, while the brew continues to bubble upwards quite a bit. The nose is both florals and adjunt; corn, I suppose. The flavor profile feels a bit heavy on corn, with a light, prickly bitterness present from the hop profile, which is basically floral and a touch of grass.

The flavor is a little sweeter with the malts showing more bread than hay and the hops a little lighter than I expected, more grassy than floral or spicy noble hops.

A thoughtful bonus from Jason I wondered how this would compare to the brewery only release of years past. As it turns out the tweaks to the recipe make it mildly more appealing. A nice sessionable beer that gives you enough flavor to be worth your time but not so much your palate is dead after one bottle I heartily recommend this to anyone who is looking for world class beers of a normal alcoholic level.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep coppery bronze body was warm with a gentle glow. Ebony head folded in itself over time until only a thin layer remained. The smell of stale rye bred and cold tea would normally be bland but for this style it does what it should - provides some flavor without blasting you in complexity.

Flavor / Palate - The rich malty start is succeeded by a tang of brisk hops. The two balance out nicely leaving a memorable finish that somehow isnt wearisome even after the final sip. I suspect this may be one of those beers that is much better fresh but will hold some qualities for a few months. Even so if you get a chance to try it do so sooner rather than later.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Bits of charred malts, and skunk are hitting my taste buds. It has this almost burnt/smoky malt flavor to it. Decent hop backing, but theres not much to this beer.

4302,"2011-04-25",3.1,"12 oz bottle from Drew. Thanks! The new version.. Skeptical. Pours a dulled darker golden pour, near transparent, well carbonation, crisp yet darker almost amber, with a moderate frothy offwhite head that cakes, stays a decent layer, laces well. Good retention. Aromas are interesting: crisp cereal grains, touches of toast, bread dough, a light floral hopping, touches of grass. Gentle, yet a distinct socky aroma, not necessarily stinky, but a detractor. Light, it gets a touch more biscuity and maybe even a bit toasty, the hops seem the bad part here, light grass and florals and that sockiness. Initial is heavier side of light bodied, some light soapy florals move into cereal grains, bread, and toasty, light and easily quaffable, a touch of pepper up front, some straw, and earthy hops are gentle, with a moderate blast of doughy bread, toast, and cereal grains, faint honey. Finish is lingering light doughy sweetness, faint bitterness and spice. Bubbly and fizzy on the palate. Ok, doesnt remind me of the previous version though.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

4302,"2011-04-22",3.2,"12oz bottle, courtesy of pantanap. Thanks, Kan!! I was disappointed to see that this second batch warranted a separate listing, as the 500mL format was just amazing... so it goes. Pours a light brown color with brilliant clarity, modest, fine-bubbled off-white head with decent retention and nice lacing (much darker and nothing like the fluffy head formation of the previous rendition). Muted, nondescript aroma, with light bready maltiness and some unenthusiastic noble-y hops; clean fermentation, crisp, but really not much here; perhaps a touch of caramel (which really gets me thinking in the direction of an American dark lager much more than any sort of Bo Pils,,,). Medium-light body; lively carbonation, with a forward carbonic bite at the tip of the tongue; actually kind of rough of an approach. Moderate amounts of bready malts and hints of caramel (w/ maybe a touch of papery oxidation); the German hop character is solid and spicy and on the minerally side of things, but the harsh carbonation and rather bland maltiness (though more forward than a straightup Pils grain bill) just detracts from the experience. A big letdown from the first batch, certainly, though by no means a bad beer; skillfully fermented and technically flawless... just not much to fall in love with. Brief finish, with a more overt showing of papery oxidation and that rather wimpy caramel.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Taste is grassy hops, light fruit, toasted malt backbone and sourdough.  The finish is sharp, yet remains well balanced as the tanginess is balanced out by the toasted grain character.

A bit of grass and bready malts. Not exactly a Boh Pils. On the taste, this is a pretty rustic beer. I really wish they hadnt filtered it because it seems like it would have been awesome as a Kellerbier. Sweetness from the malts and from the alcohol notes, also has a distinct fermentation character. There are some esters that make this endearing, if flawed. Has very low bitterness as well, could use more. A bit tart and bread-like in the finish. A pretty delicious beer, but definitely not a Boh. Pils at all.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
4302,"2011-04-10",3.5,"Poured from 12oz bottle, pours a dark golden with a white frothy head and lacing through out the glass, aroma is bready with a nice hop touch, the flavor is of toasted grain, caramel and some hop notes in the finish, pretty crisp and fresh, not as good as the original release but still pretty decent.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"
4302,"2011-04-10",3.7,"Deep, deep toasted golden color if not slightly amber.  Pilsner malt and noble hops.  Robust pilsner malt flavor with skunky noble hop bitterness.  Well-rounded, smouth, clean, and crisp.  What a pilsner should be, other craft breweries take note.  In some ways like better than original, other ways not.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
4302,"2011-04-08",3.4,"Pours hazy/dirty orange with white head.  Aroma is some grain, sweet bread, lemon, some almost sour cardboard.  Taste is sweet grain, some sour grain, touch of lemon and biscuit, lively carb and a slightly bitter finish.  Totally different profile from the original, no hop, slightly sweet and slightly bitter.  Glad I only got a 6 pack...was too good to be true to have that good of a beer year round.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4302,"2011-04-05",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2015 Bottle. Well this kind of blows. Pulled the trigger on a few cases of this thinking I was getting something closer to the first batch but a surprise unannounced recipe change and a difficult return to the store from Chicago so I guess Ill just drink it and rate. Pours a copper color with white foamy head. Aroma has toasted malt, mild smokey grain husk, and grassy hop undertones. Flavors are sweet caramel malts, light toasty notes, hay, grass, and slight metallic finish. Light and refreshing. More like a Vienna now than a pils. I know I didnt need to bootleg so much of it but perhaps a press release about the recipe change is only fair and I wouldnt have picked up so much without trying it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
4302,"2011-04-05",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2012 Edit: Originally I thought the recipe changed just a bit but I am convinced this is nothing like the original. Nor is this a pilsener. This is a hybrid beer somewhere between a maerzen and an exportbier.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
4302,"2011-04-04",3.3,"This is most definitely NOT the same world class beer that I enjoyed last summer.  WHY CHANGE IT?  Anyway, the beer pours to a weird looking rusty yellow body with a nice white head.  The color is strange and not attractive.  It detracted a lot.  The aroma is honey glazed biscuits and alfalfa.  Nearly the same from memory, but without that awesome mineral quality and pungent floral hops.  The flavor is bready.  Hops are hardly there at all.  Sweet and subtle.  No spiciness as before, but theres an ever so light metallic component like a copper penny.  The palate seems a bit thin with a weird lingering flavor.  Im bummed that they significantly changed what was near perfection with the original recipe.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
