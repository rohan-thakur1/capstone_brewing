2991,"2014-01-06",2.8,"Sampled at RBSG 10 (notes). Pours a clear light golden color with a small wihite head. The aroma and flavor have sweet grainy malt, sweet corn, with light earthy notes to the finish. It is what I would have expected it to be.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2991,"2013-05-09",2.7,"Backlogged rating: Corny and grainy malts with a moderate alcohol presence throughout. The mouthfeel is actually quite nice, lively and sharp with a medium booze warming. Not much depth or all that exciting.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2991,"2011-05-02",2.6,"From December 2010 tasting notes. On tap at brewpub. Sweet malt aroma. Straw colored with a small white head. Malt flavor with grassy hops in the finish.","South Whitley, Indiana, USA","queenholly"
2991,"2011-04-11",2.6,"sampled at RBSG 2010 - Pours yellow and smells of grainy malt.  The flavor is smooth sweet corn.  Its light bodied and its okay.  Barely.  Im not sold on craft breweries bothering with this style.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
2991,"2011-03-28",1.6,"On tap at the brewpub.

First off, what a mess! This is not very good. A medium gold that is totally clear with a light tan head, not much retention or lacing...Totally dead aroma, only the lightest hint of honey...The taste is god awful garbage, all alcohol and skunk, just grainy alcohol.

Avoid this, even if its in a sampler, even if youre a ticker like me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
2991,"2010-12-22",2.3,"Tap at brewpub.  Barley malt and fusel alcohol aroma aroma with a hint of grass.  Golden yellow color with small head.  Sweet barley malt flavor with bitter alcohol flavor.  Okay but only a bit better than your typical cheap crap malt liquor.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2991,"2010-11-04",1.5,"Clear yellow, small white head.  Aroma is corny alcohol.  Taste is sweet corn with plastic and alcohol finish.  Bang up imitation of a macro-malt liquor.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","envane"
2991,"2010-11-01",3.1,"Draft sampler at FSRB. well, it mimics the character of commercial malt liquors very well, and thats the drawback. Yellow color and fusel alcohol smell. I smell lots of corn sweetening, too. Yet, the taste is not timid about showing its alcohol, a patch over the usual canned rotgut. That alcohol at least warms me instead of burning. Helped out by a soda carbonation mouthfeel. At least I dont feel like Im developing a hangover already.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
2991,"2010-10-10",3.6,"Nose is sweet and corny, but clean and inoffensive with notes of grain, sweet bread, and light earthy hops. Pours golden with a creamy head and nice visible bubbles. THe flavor is sweet and grainy with a good deal of corn, some light fruitiness and a light bitterness in the finish. A solid malt liquor.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2991,"2010-10-06",3.0,"sampled during a mug club tapping at the brewpub.  served in a brown paper bag.  lightly hazy yelloow, slim white head, somewhat lacy.  mostly corn in the nose.  flavor is corn, malt, with a trace of bitter hops.  medium bodied, light, sweet finish.  a great lawn mowin beer.  ill drink it again.","Monee, Illinois, USA","dm9831"
2991,"2010-10-05",3.0,"Sampled at the brewpub bar with a clear, golden hue, with bubbly silk to the head foam, and some good, curtainy lacing that broke up, but remained clingy as the liquid lowered. The aroma was very light, almost imperceptible, but with a little warmth, presented light alcohol and a little corn. The flavor was light grain, a hint of sweetness, subdued hop bitterness, and warming alcohol. Not bad, but I think that I was having some Colt-45 or Schlitz flashback, so I probably wouldnt order it again.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
2991,"2010-09-21",2.4,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours golden with a foamy white head. Aroma is of corn, alcohol, and straw. Smells less awful than a lot of other malt liquors. Taste is malty, with corn, straw, and honey. Slight alcohol flavor. Very nasty aftertaste lingers after each sip.  Instead of being a really boozy and nasty malt liquor, its just sort of bland. I knew what I was getting into, and its not terrible.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
2991,"2010-09-13",2.2,"From the Keggie that Adam won for naming the beer. At RBSG 10. Pours a pure yellow with a head that dissipates. Nose is sweet and candied. Creamed corn in the backgrown with booze present in the nose as well. On taste, quite sweet and corny. No hops. A bit fusel as well. Pretty much a standard malt liquor...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
2991,"2010-08-26",3.1,"Golden pour with medium fluffy white head that evaporates quickly.   Corn adjuncts and sweet candy corn aroma with some alcohol whiffs, but lacking the rocket fuel diesel esters  I was afraid Id find.  Pretty drinkable beverage, but not one Id like to see clogging up a tap for very long.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
2991,"2010-08-26",3.1,"At the mug club tapping, this was properly served in brown paper bags.  I took a peek and saw that the body was a yellow, slightly hazed, with a decent enough white head.  The aroma was corny, sweet, and had a whiff of alcohol - not quite the diesel fumes that one expects from the style.  It was sweet and mildly alcoholic to the flavor, but I missed the metallic bitterness that I usually enjoy from my 40s.  Overall, a noble effort from Bryan and Richard... both who were enjoying this a wee bit much at the tapping.  By the way - Did we really need to get our mug club munchies from the garbage cans?  Im all for keeping in the spirit of the style, but that seemed a bit much...","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
2991,"2010-08-21",3.1,"oak park microbrew review 2010.  shocking steel reserve 211 (silver) clone.  big alcohol esters resound in aroma and flavor with the typical white lightning banana and even stank watermelon.  corny, hot booze, an amazing rendition of the style that rings true to gigantic factory production examples.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
2991,"2010-08-04",2.7,"A: The pour has got a little more going for it than your standard malt liquor. Nice pale golden color with a very mild white head that is likely attributed to the growler.

S: The nose is certainly malt liquor-esque. Lots of sweet adjuncts, primarily corn, with a hint of skunk. There is actually some malt and hop character to this one though, lightly floral and earthy.

T: Quite sweet like it should be, but there is a fair bitterness too. Also a very noticeable off-flavor that you often get with some of the less than optimal quality malt beverages. Definitely grainy, and perhaps even sugary at times, too.

M: The body is medium, which is quite the compliment for a beer of this stature. Moderate carbonation to go with it.

D: This is no Stack High Gravity Lager, but its not an Earthquake High Gravity Lager either. Middle of the road malt liquor, here.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2991,"2010-07-29",3.0,"Keggie served at the RBSG Grand Tasting (Grand Rapids, MI). Pours a hazy glowing gold pour, yellowish, with a small whitish head that dissipates to a tiny film, laces small. Aromas are corny, cereal grains, bread, light mellow honey, touch of florals. Simple yet ok. Bready malts mesh with corn and cereal grains, light florals, a touch of boozy alcohol, warming down the palate. A touch of fruity citrus and faint peach move into bready and cereal grain dominance. Fruity, bready, light bitterness with a bit too much booze for me. But then again, its a malt liquor. It is truly what it is.. Cleaner and better balanced than those Ive had before, but a bit hot and a malty grainy bread dominance with light fruitiness. Ok, one of the best Ive had.. But it is what it is.. Goodluck at GABF with this, boys.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2991,"2010-07-29",2.6,"Draught at RBSG grand tasting. My first beer of the evening! Big, malty aroma with corn and sweet malts. Cloudy, pale yellow. Very sweet corn flavor, almost all corn! Pretty decent for what it is. Flavorful.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
2991,"2010-07-25",3.7,"Shared by FlssmrBrewAlum at the RBSG Grand Tasting. Pours a hazy straw yellow color with a medium head. Good head retention and lacing. Fruity aroma with a good bit of corn and some nutty notes. Smells like a malt liquor. Taste is peach, banana and some grainy notes. Medium-full bodied. Damn good for a malt liquor.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
