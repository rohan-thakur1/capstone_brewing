3864,"2017-01-16",3.7,"Pours a hazy, bright yellow color, with just a subtle orange touch. Got a medium sized, stable and bubbly head.

Juice! This features the most exotic, ripe fruits, together with an additional layer of papaya jam and crisp lime zest. Summed up, the aromas remind of a tropical fruit cocktail, with a tremendous amount of pineapples, mango, orange and kiwi.

Has a sparkly mouthfeel to it and drinks way lighter than the fantastic nose indicated, due to less pronounced hops on the palate.

Tastes of bread and slightly mineralic water, from which a slowly developing hoppiness becomes detectable. At the same time as fruity lime pulp hits the tastebuds, a caramel malt flavor sets up a pleasant balance. Once adjusted, the flavors begin to benefit from each other, revealing subtle nuances of pomelo, tangerine, peach and a whiff of earth. Finishes surprisingly bitter, while the beers dryness maintains most of the fruits on the tongue till the end. 

Starts too thin, gets a little too sweet and malty during mid palate, while finishing very well. The flavors take their time to merge, but once they chase the same goal, this becomes nice.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Beautiful, hazy yellow and orange coloured beer. 
Aroma is just a 10/10 for a regular IPA. Alcoholic orange and mango juice. 
Taste is like the aroma but with added grapefruit bitterness and pineyness, and of course not as strong as the aroma. A really enjoyable bitterness but nothing mind blowing. A little herby at the back as it warms up
Quite sticky on the palate but super drinkable, as expected.
If I would compare this to Stigbergets Amazing Haze, that one wins. This is great but feels more session-y and much lighter taste than AH.
Overall, it뇹 a really good IPA with a delicious aroma but a weaker taste that dissappears quite quickly which brings it a down a bit. If this was a Session IPA it would be one of the best in the world.","Malm칬, SWEDEN","EerieDrinks"
