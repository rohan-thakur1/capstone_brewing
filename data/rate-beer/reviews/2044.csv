Piękny bursztynowy kolor, lekkie zamglenie.
Fajna biała piana, redukująca się do solidnej oponki.
Dużo zaciekaów na szkle.
W aromacie, podobnie jak w smaku jest wiele warstw. Jest intenyswna bretowość (stajnia, siano, pasek skórzany), jest też wysoka owocowość (pomarańcze), na koniec przyprawowa fenolowość.
W ustach pozostaje także lekko ziołowy posmak.
Bardzo smaczne, gęste i szybko znika ze szkła. Super brettowy i tak samo owocowy dzikus. Takie lubię najbardziej!","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"
2044,"2017-03-27",3.8,"SBF #18 Fajny, dziki saison, średnio ustrzelono styl. Ale nie marudzę! Bretty poszły w pestkową, nieco przyprawową stronę z wyraźnym akcentem białego grona. Perliste, lekkie, wyraźnie owocowe, leciutko stajenne. Smakowało!","Katowice, POLAND","mgajdaczewa"

No sourness from the Brett, but a clean pleasant dryness that really allows this beer to shine. Great beer. Earlier Rating: 5/4/2016 Total Score: 3.9On tap @ Black Raven.

2044,"2016-03-03",3.7,"2015 bottle, clear amber beer, white head faded. Aroma malt, kombucha, citrus, pineapple. Taste is black pepper, lychee, oak, kombucha, pears, salt, grapefruit, resin. Palate is light, carbonation moderate. Finish is tannic oak and resin, and is out of balance with the rest of the beer. If this had just a bit less oak it would be outrageous.","Eagle River, Alaska, USA","furthur"
2044,"2015-10-04",3.9,"Clear oily orange with minimal head. Citrus and other light fruits with slight malt. Sweet aroma. Medium body. Flavor is musty and dry citrus, tart middle, dry finish of hay, earth, and citrus. The dry booze really lasts. Enjoyable.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"

2044,"2015-05-27",4.0,"375mL bottle, pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Nose is very woody, with lots of oak, bretty funk, and hay. Flavour is quite funky, with considerable bretty notes, wood and oak -- not getting any of the fruit. Super dry, funky and a little bready. Wonderfully complex and highly drinkable. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2044,"2015-05-16",4.0,"12.7 oz bottle- Pours a clear golden with a thin white head. Aroma is very brett forward, while i was pouring the glass i got the aromas of funky wet basement, mildly tart, fruity, very appealing. The taste is citrusy, light tartness, brett, hops are very noticeable, imparting a dry finish. Wonderful beer, even better than expected.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
2044,"2015-04-01",4.1,"Bottle from the Beer Authority.

Very glad to get to try this one. Black Raven continues to impress. Beautiful glowing gold pour (I wish you could see the sunlight streaming through right now) with a modest white head. Aroma of dry dusty fields, flavors a very well integrated blend of leathery brett with satsuma orange peel, quite dry, not all that complex but a beautiful venue for the brett. Zero sign (beyond the mild buzz from blasting through a bottle on an empty stomach) that this beer is above 6%. Lovely beer. I could drink huge volumes of this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2044,"2015-02-24",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2015 Bottle (12.7oz $7) Clear golden with thin white head. Aroma was like a hoppy Belgian. Taste was citrus followed by some sweetness, then a little bitterness and finish with a little warming (at least with the first sip).","Woodinville, Washington, USA","jsnicholas"
2044,"2015-02-08",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2016 Draft pour at the brewery. Pours an oily copper color with a thin patchy head. Grainy, big spice aroma. A lot of spice here, but not quite sure what spice it is. Ill think of it a couple days from now most likely. Some corn and straw flavors and a little dry towards the finish. Very unique beer for sure. Good beer here.  Update: 2016 version, renamed Raven De Brett.  Much fruitier this time through, a less noticeable spice.  Big Brett impact.  Nice beer.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2044,"2015-02-04",3.6,"375, capped and foiled. Pours a cloudy dark toffeeish amber. Loose creamy/sudsy whitish head that sticks around for a while as a thin layer. Decent lace. Big toffee sweet nose, some floral notes, a little bit of sweet cream. Creamy medium body with light carb. Toffee sweet, slightly creamy, rather floral mid palate with some dry minerals near the end. More of a scattered sampling of belgian pale notes from both abbey and farmhouse than a focused biere de garde, but still very pleasant and drinkable. Quite a hit with unsuspecting tablemates, which was fun.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2044,"2015-01-31",3.9,"Draft at brewery last night. Dark amber pour, small hop and spice aroma, can taste some age to this beer.","Duvall, Washington, USA","tcon25"
2044,"2015-01-17",4.0,"Flight at brewpub. Clear orange amber color. Moderately sticky lacing. Aroma is straight up Brett - a little oily but not goatsy. A little sweet Brett and lots of barnyard funk. Its very nice and I get no dry hop notes, which I am thankful for. Lots of fruity bretty. Flavor again hits with a dry fruit, a candied mild ester flavor. I like it, low alpha bitter, mild acidity, dry finish. Malt flavor is a clean amber maltiness - clean faint woodsy. Short aftertaste. Mild malt and Brett bitterness at the end.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2044,"2015-01-09",3.5,"Tap when I had La Petite Mort. Wish I could rate this higher as the idea of a bretted BDG is awesome. Bit too light for me this one though. Hints of barnyard and hay with elements of funk buried beneath perish malts of sweetness abound. Could be much more full.","Earth, Washington, USA","skoisirius"
2044,"2014-03-04",3.3,"Interesting mix of funky Brett and spicy and citrusy hops. Light body; perhaps too light. Mild bitterness. Pleasant Brett aromas (i.e., not overpowering). Odd beer, but its interesting and surprisingly easy to drink.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

2044,"2013-12-16",3.8,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours light amber with atiny beige head and a sweet and sour fruit aroma. There is a bitter light malt flavor with a lot of yeast presence and a fruity finish.  Very unique.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
2044,"2013-12-14",4.2,"What seems to be a capped 750 from Malt & Vine. (7.4%) Biere de Garde - aka Pale Ale Belgian Style with brett! Pours hazy orange gold with a transient white head. Aroma is light brett. AKA sweatsox. Med +body. Sort of fizzy carb. Starts real spritzy brett, quickly moves on to less spritzy brett. Brett ever in the nose. Brett ever in the quaff. Its not going to kill taste buds, its only moderately sour. BUT IT IS ALWAYS BRETT. Damn good thing. Swear this is being underrated. What a nice surprise on a Saturday evening after a rather meh Scandinavian ale. Yum.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2044,"2013-12-03",4.1,"Bottle with thanks to glkaiser! Pours a crystal clear amber with a medium creamy beige head that dissipates slowly with nice lacing. Aroma is light overall with notes of citrus, herbs, yeast, pine, Brett. Flavor is bretty, citrus, pine, light sweetness, herbs, light plus bitterness. Medium body, but a nice oily mouthfeel. This is really a Belgian IPA IMO, but it is nice. The Brett character rivals Anchorage in its quality. I am a big fan of this one.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

Pours a crystal gold with a sheet of whites. Smells of pineapple, grain, some hay, some nice amber malt. Good nose. Flavor is grain, cardboard, some funk, some other goods. Medium bodied with moderate carb. Nice beer, but nothing special.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"
2044,"2013-02-09",3.7,"A good deal of toasted malts up front, a little bretty funk, some fruity aspects as well. Interesting. Pours golden amber, fizzy white head, soft lace.

Banana, apple, white grape, musty hay, bits of doughy grain and faint pepper.  Very peppery up front, some slightly tart mostly bright white grape, not much malt showing at all, dry winey long peppery finish.  Bit thin.","Washington, USA","bvc"
2044,"2012-09-13",3.8,"Clear gold, light haze. Aroma of floral and citrusy hops, spicy yeast, also fruit. Taste is sweet with some resinous bitterness. Pretty nice stuff, seems more like an IPA.","Washington, USA","Beerona97"
