4029,"2017-05-18",4.1,"On tap at the Pour Taproom (SC). 
Pours with a lightly hazy amber body and a generous white head that has very good retention. 
Aroma: sweet and odd (but not in a bad way), with fruity and berry notes.
Flavor: tropical fruit and floral notes from the hops; faint bready malts. Surprisingly sweet for style: in fact, more sweet than bitter? 
Mouthfeel: near medium body with soft, medium carbonation. 
Overall: refined and mild for style, this has a distinctive aroma and flavor.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

4029,"2017-04-14",4.0,"(On tap @ Bottlecraft North Park, SD, April 4/17) Pours a lightly murky orange-gold with a big white head and lace. Aroma of lots of bright citrus, pine needles, some floral fruitiness, a little caramel malt, cereal grains, quite balanced but pretty big hop nose. Flavour is robust citrus zest mix, pine, floral tropical fruit like passion fruit or lychee, orange flesh, a little caramel and bread from the malt, resinous bitterness building in the finish, fairly rich cereals for style, lingering floral quality. Moderate bitterness overall. Medium-full body for style with fairly creamy carb. This is a pretty big APA but the malt is actually surprisingly well layered and the hop presence robust. I dont normally love this more old school approach, but its a very solid offering.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

4029,"2017-03-15",4.2,"This is a nice pale ale and the first beer overall that Ive tried from this particular brewery. Safe to say they made a good first impression. Pours cloudy with a nice golden amber color, and smells sweet and hoppy. The taste is citrusy and fresh, with a dry and short finish. Almost lemon-orangey at times.

This bottle is one month old, wonder how it would be even fresher. This is made on the ""old"" apa style, before NE style existed. Im still surprise to see how much I like it since Im now converted to that NE style. The aroma could be a bit more fruit-in-your-face or even have some pines in it to make it a bit more strong aroma-speaking. On the end the taste is fruity enough. Great mouthfeel.

Bitter, citric, mineral, herbal, dirt-like flavor. Thyme and lemon peel. Quite a nice pale ale. Dry, lightly bitter finish and aftertaste. Medium body. Seems substantial in the palate but nothing special. A notably good beer but not as outstanding as for what I was hoping from this very highly regarded brewery. Reads somewhere between a typical APA and IPA, although I do think it leans toward the former and is appropriately marketed and classified. A good beer but not a special one and nowhere near as good as the ratings here imply.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

The pour is, you guessed it, an orangey golden yellow color with a thin ring of white head that leaves a ton of lace as it falls. The aroma is light. There is a good hoppiness to it and a bit of citrus. There is a little pine on the finish. The flavor is citrusy and juicy up front and then a hop rolls in before a piney resin kicks through and carries it to the finish. I was hoping for a little more juicy hop.

4029,"2016-02-10",3.4,"Draught at Row 34, 2/4/16.Crystal clear body is of light peach-nectarine/burnished copper. Moderate amounts of carbonation create a large white head that slowly fades to cover.Orange and nectarine notes in the nose give an almost Mosaic-like quality, but are quickly consumed by a stronger pine-grapefruit character. Sweet pale malts in the background mix with the strong, acidic hop notes to yield a more lush, juicy aroma, but it still retains plenty of resin. Light pineapple and orange rind lingering and clean, with no alcohol noted.Sweet at first, with strong honey and whitebread character. It gives the pine and grapefruit a place to go and does balance fairly well. However, the hop flavors are just a bit too monotonous for my liking, with tons of pine, orange rind, tangy pineapple and a very light floral character. Lots of bitterness and a touch of dry, earthiness on the finish.

4029,"2016-01-03",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2016 Golden-colored with a bit of foam on the top. The nose is very fruity and citrusy, with the malt notes taking on a support role. Grapefruit, orange, kiwi, ripe pineapples, grass, petals, and then a background of honey, cereal, and just a bit of pine and white pepper for a truly alluring aroma. Really wonderful mouthfeel, bright and lively with bubbly, prickly carbonation. Under the palate its bitter, mildly sweet, and a bit citrusy-tangy.

Dank, juicy hop aroma thats bursting with tropical and citrus fruit notes which are countered by a floral, grassy presence and some pale malt. Slightly piney and earthy along with some orange peel, mango, papaya and grapefruit. Subtle bread like yeast and biscuity malt. Smells great!

Medium bodied with dry, sticky hop bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malts into a dry finish. Theres a decent amount of tropical/citrus sweetness but it isnt as prominent as the nose suggests. More of an earthy/floral character than expected overpowering hints of pineapple, orange peel and grapefruit. Decent malt backbone but it doesnt hinder the hop flavors, giving off hints of biscuit and cracker.

Poured a golden, pale, semi-clear color with 4-to-5 fingers of off-white, frothy head. Average amount of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Great looking spiderweb layered lacing on the sides of the glass. Good retention. (Sight - 4.25)

First thought on the smell was wow. Getting floral, Citra, pine, tropical, tangerine, red grapefruit rind, pineapple, nectarine zest, light mango, sharp apricot and faint peach. Kind of reminded me of Alpines Duet. This was great on the nose. (Smell - 4.63)

Taste didnt quite live up to the nose, but very good. Actually reminded me of a session IPA, which I get is pretty close to a pale ale. Got floral, tropical, pineapple, pine, tangerine rind, orange blossom, light passion fruit, sharp grapefruit and juicy apricot. Could almost taste pulp. (Taste - 4.38)

Light body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, fruity finish. (Feel - 4.63)

This was fantastic. Not quite as good as an Alpine (not Green Flash) Hoppy Birthday, but pretty damn close. So fresh. (Overall - 4.50)

4029,"2015-06-29",4.2,"BOD 3/10/15. Pours a clear golden with just a touch of amber. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

World class rich complex nose of tropical hops (pineapple, mango), citric (orange), a touch of pepper and pine resin over very subtle biscuit.

Light body with a smooth texture coupled with a subtle oily character. Normally carbonated with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a fair burst in the finish.

The flavor profile is almost world class. It lacks just a bit of biscuit sweetness to provide more balance and enhance the complexity. It is a tropical hop forward pale ale with a pine resin background. Bitterness is mild with a subtle orange bitterness underneath. The hop flavors of the nose all make an appearance.

A very nice APA - juicy fruit flavours and an excellent appearance really promise a great experience... which doesnt quite materialize. The taste, while decent, is slightly less interesting than what was promised by the nose. The soft carbonation ends up making this feel just a little on the flat side, and the finish dies a little abruptly. Now that I think about it, a little higher carbonation might well have solved all the issues. In any case, I wanted to like this more than I do - and thats not to say I dont like it, but I dont love it as much as I thought I might. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

In the body with some decent amber glow hitting the edges. Big cakey offwhite head sits atop, large bubbles with good stick around. Decent lacing overall. Aromas show firmer lemony hop elements, rind and citrus oils meet gentle bready malts, nice florals, a flick of melon and gentle fruity life. Touches of leafy green hops, a bit earthy with more fruit as it settles down. Initial is lighter end of the fold, a nice firm bitterness up front throws lemon, florals, some decent soapiness. Middle shows just a touch of body but not sweet. Firm bitter hops keep ticking with lemon, gentle grapefruit, firm florals and soap, gentle waft of pine. Pretty hoppy albeit the flavors kinda blend in a bit. Gentle bit of fruit. Backend is crisp, bitter and dry, a bit of mineral like flavors mix with that firm bitterness. The hops are enjoyable, the beer sound and crafted well. Light body, bright hops. Shying away from potent fruit or trendy hops, this Pale is pretty sound and enjoyable. Lingering grapefruit rind and juice, lemon and florals, bitter earthy green leafy hops are ever present, fairly fresh, and enjoyable. Lighter and pretty crushable, fresh but also has a touch of substance to it.

It is very pleasant on the palate - lots of hoppiness up front, providing a superb balance between a pleasant bitterness and citrusy and grassy notes. The maltiness in this beer is spot on - it remains crisp and evident, although doesnt provide much sweetness on the palate. The bitterness stays restraint and at the same time takes it right to the limit of what the maltiness allows - and lands on a perfect level of balance. This is one of the best American Pale Ales Ive ever tried.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"

4029,"2014-03-01",4.0,"500ml bottle into a tulip.

A: Pours a hazy golden color. The head is a two finger eggshell shade. Retention is very good, and so is the thick texture. And so is the lacing left behind, really.

S: The first whiffs heave a goodly amount of grapefruit, with a subtle backing of tropical fruit. Give it time to open up, and some biscuity malts will appear, along with a piny touch. Aromatically, it doesnt beat the senses over the nose - rather, it works through delicate, balanced subtlety.

T: While it opens fairly bitterly on the tongue, it finishes with a healthy dose of mango and melon. The bitterness washes away nicely on the back end, and even supplanted by a hint of malt. Its quite Simcoe forward, and I thats precisely why I like it so much.

M: Superbly crisp and clean. Very little of anything lingers on the tongue, apart from a slight bitterness. Id even call it thirst quenching, which is frankly amazing taking its dry finish into consideration. It does all of this without relying on strong carbonation, too.

O: No singular element of this blows the mind, but in the same way that Lunch or Sculpin work, continuing to drink it will reveal a very elegant, refined example of a style thats mainly reliant on brute force. Still, this is a LOT of money for a simple pale ale, even one as good as this.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Pine & tangerine rind get more prominent with time... Taste is nice & bitter up front, really cuts the palate nicely. Pungent pines, grass, weeds, & some light, herbaceous tones. Citric elements include grapefruit piths & peels, very bitter in nature with a back-end delicacy that blends with the light, bready pale malt sweetness.

4029,"2014-01-17",3.6,"Reviewed from notes. I poured this into a nonic. It pours a clear light golden color and leaves the same color body with a faint orange hue. The white head was about three fingers for about a good two minutes before slowly dieing. The lacing was light, and somewhat spotty. Some carbonation was seen rising. No rings were left as the beer was sipped.
The aroma was entered around the hops. Some citrus came out to play, but very subtley.
The taste was centered around the hops, some citrus came out but it was mostly faint. There was a faint malty backbone. The finish was mostly bitter and dry.
On the palate, it was about a medium sort of body and well carbonated, with a lingering dryness, but was still balanced. It was mostly a drinkable beer.
Overall, I say this is a pretty good APA that I would have again though I currently cant get it in my distribution of where I live, if I lived on the East Coast like I used to, this would be a ""pizza beer"" that would make a great night.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Aroma of zesty, earthy hops alongside some citrus and a big sweet toffee/caramel malt bill. Just smelling this I have to assume it isnt fresh enough to enjoy as intended so Ill tick for now and rerate another time with a fresh one. Flavor begins with some light grass, a good bit of lemon zest, grapefruit, and ending with some sweet toffee. Even with this age the beer is light and zesty on the palate.

4029,"2013-11-02",4.7,"Pours a hazy honey orange color with a finger and a half white head. Great head retention that leaves a thin blanket of lacing. Good amount of carbonation coming off the glass. Smells of more citrus fruits up front like grapefruit and orange. Then beneath that there are some tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, as well as a tiny hint of pine and floral. The malt imparts a sweet breadiness note that makes the fruit aromas seem more juicier. Taste is outstanding. Reminds me of a Hill Farmstead beer. Starts with hefty doses of bitter grapefruit and orange notes. The the middle brings a crackery, bready, sweet malt presence that balances quite nice with the increasing bitter, yet juicy grapefruit. Also starting to get tropical fruit notes as well. The finish brings more juicy tropical fruit notes like pineapple. Also getting more juicy grapefruit and a good amount of pine. Definitely detect the red wheat on the finish as well. Getting almost like a bubblegum flavor. Bitter, but not as aggressive as you might expect. In-your-face, yet delicate from the balance of malt and hops, as well as the clean finish. Medium body with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. The carbonation is perfect, as it refreshes the beer and cleanses the palate, which makes you want to take another sip. Ive had a lot of amazing pale ales, and this one is right up there with those.

4029,"2013-07-06",4.0,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. I bought it from a friend who got it on a road trip to Vermont (thanks, Jon!). It was bottled on 6/4/13.

Appearance: Almost glowing hue of yellow/orange. Cloudy body, but translucent with fine carbonation visible. Forms a large, white frothy head which retains and laces extremely well.

Smell: Rich, sweet tropical fruit notes rather than citrus per se. A significant herbal scent as well.

Taste: If youre a craft beer enthusiast, youre probably familiar with the concept of a ""San Diego IPA."" I think its time to coin another term for IPAs from a region that taste similar, the ""New England IPA."" Ive had several of them in the last few weeks and while they each have their own uniqueness, theres a lot of similarities to them: tropical fruit aroma, intense, dry bitterness; hints of garlic and herbs; and bottle/can conditioning. Thats MO Pale Ale in a nutshell, and thats why it works.

The beer starts off with significant bitterness immediately. Its on the dry side, like a saison, though through the middle comes some sweetness akin to tropical fruit juice. Guava, passion fruit, kiwi and grapefruit flavors are noticeable, creating for a fruit cocktail-like sensation. As it begins its descent, a subtle garlic and/or onion flavor emerges. Its not as strong as some of the bigger beers, though it is noticeable and definitely keeps in the tradition of the New England IPA. Though the brewery calls it a pale ale, MO could easily fit into the IPA style because of its intense bitterness and robust body. 

Drinkability: Another reason you might consider Maine Beers ""MO"" an IPA is because it doesnt have the higher drinkability of a standard pale ale. The beer is bottle conditioned, which accounts for the high carbonation, some of which gets stuck in the throat. Its not challenging to drink, though the mouthfeel is rather intense, so its better enjoyed sipped than glugged. The aftertaste is dry but not cloying, however, the beer itself isnt particularly refreshing. At 6% ABV, MO is a pretty strong for a pale ale, but would easily pair with a hearty meal, sharp cheeses, or work as a standalone beverage.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Je tente de mattarder sur le profil céréalier mais je ne veux pas poursuivre: pourquoi vouloir quitter le territoire des cultivars? En bouche, un corps en pleine possession de ses moyens avec des bulles qui nettoient bien le palais et une texture bien souple. En finale, une longue présence de notes florales bien amères et très asséchantes.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

4029,"2013-06-01",4.2,"A large white foam sits above a very pale golden and cloudy hue. Highly aromatic, very fruity Pale Ale with a cushiony pale malt base that is both very lean and feeling fullsome thanks to the healthy yeast presence. The bitterness is limited in terms of pure bitterness, but also in terms of hop character - the flavours being more toward volatile flowery and tropical fruitiness than harsher, more lingering resins. It makes for a hugely drinkable, that while boasting a relatively modest 6% ABV, feels even lighter. Cleansing, engaging carbonation is natural and festive. That brewery is one of if not the one Maines surest value. Somehow, even though I buy bottles in Vermont frequently and they seem to be steadily available there, I always get them in a satisfying freshness state for all their hop-forward character.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Palate:Medium light body, a quick finish.
Summary: After having a night full of belgian style beers and some stouts, I didnt want to call it a night before having some hops! And boy this doesnt disappoint. Just like with Peeper Ale, a well constructed APA that really has a nice hop profile. Dont know if I prefer Peeper or MO..guess Ill have to try again.  Thanks Ben!","Maryland, USA","jcos"

4029,"2013-01-16",4.3,"Bottle. Split with Janine for her birthday. Pours bright canary yellow with a thin, fuzzy white head that recedes to leave a small ring of fluffy lace around the edge of the glass. Aroma of freshly cut grass, clean soap suds, and some resiny, piney flourishes. Tastes of very fresh citrus fruits, along the lines of lemons and grapefruits, with some very grassy undertones. Almost no malt presence, which is a severely undervalued attribute in pale ales and IPAs these days, in my opinion. Medium bodied, but on the thinner side, which I also happen to enjoy very much, as it makes the beer infinitely more approachable, mellow, and drinkable. The cut of the hops more than balances the slightness of the body, which again, I enjoy immensely. This beer is very well done and I deeply appreciate Maine Beer Co.s commitment to both the environment, and more importantly, the freshness of their hoppy beers. This bottle had a bottled-on date clearly printed on its label and a recommendation from the brewers to consume it within 90 days of said date. I cannot stress enough how outrageously underutilized this practice is in the craft beer world. Thanks, Maine.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"

The tropical fruit notes really shine in the flavor as well, its like biting into a fresh mango. The malt is light, a little bit of doughy character, but mostly just stays in the back and allows the hops to shine. Light bodied and very easy drinking, it makes you want to take big gulps.

Aroma: The nose has lots of fresh hops, peach, mango, grapefruit, lots of resin, and some clean malts

Appearance: Pours a clear golden-orange color with a 2 inch sheet of white head that leaves drippy lace

Palate: The body is medium, it has a smooth, creamy, clean feel, tons of drinkability, and a nicely dry finish

Overall Impression: 
This is another Maine beer that I was really impressed by.  With Lunch and MO leading the way, Maine is quickly moving up my list of the top breweries in the country.  I really cant think of anything to complain about, this is almost exactly what Im looking for in an APA.

Aromas of citrus fill the air as soon as I tilt the bottle toward the glass. Pine and resin with a hint of bread round out the nose quite nicely. The flavor is light bread, cracker and a hint of seltzer water with a nice pine and grapefruit flavor going on. Theres a solid shot of bitterness in this one, Im guessing because the body is a bit light to stand up to the massive hopping here. Moderate level of carbonation with a watery and resinous mouthfeel.

4029,"2012-12-07",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2013 Bottled November 10, 2012.
Appearance: What a beautiful frothy off-white head that towers above the beer with great retention and dissipates messy with lots of lacing, the downfall is the opaque amber hued body that looks murky and unappealing. Great looking beer nonetheless.
Aroma: This has a nice and assertive hop aroma with citrus and tropical fruits. Orange, pineapple and mango are balanced really well in the nose hinting at only mild bitterness balanced well with the sweetness.
Taste: The intro is nice and bready with light sweetness while the hops provide more flavor than bitterness adding an orange and pineapple. Bitterness is low and balanced well though the finish is a tad thin and dries up quick.
Palate: Medium body with bready texture thanks to the carbonation.
Overall: This is a very good pale ale, but it loses points because of the price. If this were cheaper I would buy it more often.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Mouthfeel:  fairly light bodied with medium carbonation.  Overall:  One of the most floral smelling and bitterest tasting APAs Ive had.

4029,"2012-08-23",3.9,"In short: A superior piney pale ale
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed very fresh a few weeks after bottling date
The look: Mostly clear golden body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: Nose is scented pine-tree hops (borderline perfumy).  Taste has a nice medium-toasted biscuity malt backbone with sparse dried caramel.  There is a nice fruitiness (mangos, bananas, more) that seems to be coming from the yeast/fermentation as much as from the hops.  Also light notes of acidic citrus fruits and perfume.  Pine-tree and cedary hops finish with a medium bitterness of short duration.  If it wasnt for the slightly perfumy aroma and flavor this would be a truly excellent beer.

4029,"2012-08-04",3.6,"500 ml bottle purchased from Capones, sort of an odd size for an American craft. Poured a honey brown body with a large frothy off white head that left average lace but a large dense center of foam that never dissipated. Aroma of honey topped bread, orange marmalade, citrus rinds, bran cereal. Medium bodied with stronger small bubbly carbonation, a dry bitter finish and a lingering hop aftertaste. Flavor is sweet citrus pulp and rind, toast, tangerine, grapefruit, apricot. Solid beer.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

Juicy aromas of bubblegum, grapefruit juice, resinous pine, lemons, grass and just a hint of biscuity malt. Taste was just as impressive with fresh citrus hops getting most of the attention. Other notes of earthy malts, mango, caramel and pine. Smooth bitter finish, incredibly sessionable, all around an amazing hoppy pale.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

4029,"2012-07-21",3.9,"Tap at Meadhall. Translucent golden pour with a dense white head served in a wine-style chalice. Very hoppy nose. Floral, resin, and tons of bitter citrus. Taste is very floral with a restrained resin bitterness that wants to come forward but keeps itself in check. The malt is weaved in well but pretty much goes unnoticed because of the big hop fragrance and flavors. The glass is well coated and the brew is slippery in the mouth. A very floral, über-hoppy pale ale.

4029,"2012-07-12",3.3,"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 6-25-12 which puts this at just over two weeks old. Pours a murky brown. Pretty messy, kind of like pond water. Must be something about Maine Beer co because Peeper was like  that too but lighter.  Lots of exceedingly frothy head and lacing.  Mild grassy and piney aroma. mouthfeel is moderate. Taste is mostly pine with some dirt, ink, dandelion and malt. Overall a decent beer but I just don't really like MBCs yeast.  It just has a dirty flavor that I don't care for.

4029,"2012-04-09",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Piney hop cologne seeps from this frothy American Pale Ales lean body, building salient bitterness softened by lightly bready yeast.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A superb foam mushroom rises atop the hazy amber.
-This may not be as complex as Hill Farmsteads Edward, but it is a mighty beautiful APA nonetheless.
-I would leave the sediment out, especially for your first pour. It tends to obscure some of the hops brightness.
-Hops also contribute some citrusy fruitiness.
-Drinkability is very high; this brew is relatively dry and fluffy, nearly quenching.
