2049,"2016-12-30",3.8,"Deep Amber. Liked this better than the port version we had a while back. Subtle and expertly balanced red wine berries, oak, & bourbon are showcased on a lightly yeasty backdrop. Cool beer. Doesnt show the abv either.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

2049,"2016-12-25",4.2,"Bottle from Sierra Nevada Mills River. Pours golden with a thick white head. Leaves a lot of lacing in the glass. Lots of whiskey and wood on the nose.

2049,"2016-12-10",4.1,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/19/2016. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big golden raisin, plum, fig, date, apricot, apple, red grape, straw, grass, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, and biscuit; with lighter notes of pepper, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and wine/bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big golden raisin, plum, fig, date, apricot, apple, red grape, straw, grass, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, and biscuit; with lighter notes of pepper, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast/tannic oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light/dark fruits, straw, grass, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, biscuit, toffee, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and wine/bourbon barrel flavors; with a nice malt/barrel/spiciness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal dryness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and slightly slick/sticky/tannic mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 9.8%; with zero barrel booziness. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged Biere de Garde style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and wine/bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV. Awesome balance of malt/yeast flavors; with near perfect integration of the barrel complexity. Spot on for the style. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
2049,"2016-12-09",3.8,"Tap. Pours hazy copper, large creamy beige head, nice lacing. Aroma is quite herbal, some vinous notes, grain, clove. Flavors is light plus sweet, light bitter herbal and vinous, field grass. Not a lot of bourbon influence. Medium body, smooth and silky mouthfeel. Well crafted but not hitting my sweet spot. Gets better as it warms.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
