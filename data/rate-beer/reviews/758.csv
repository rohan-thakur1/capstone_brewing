758,"2013-06-29",3.7,"Appearance: Pours from the growler a medium amber/brown body, moderately hazed, with an off-white head.

Smell: Malty notes of chocolate, caramel, and toast followed fast by a salvo of cloves, with soft fruity tones closing it out.

Taste: Darkened grains glazed with sweetish caramel and a thin coating of chocolate. Growing phenolic clove accent. Fruity touches of raisins, apple, and nanas. Light herbal hops, medium-low bitterness. For a moment it seems like a late-breaking kick of malts my be pending, but, it remains earthy, drying into the finish with cloves and pepper-dusted banana slices at the tail end.

Mouthfeel: Just a hair over medium-bodied and just a bit above medium carbonation.

758,"2012-10-08",3.2,"Had on tap at Piece, served in a 12 oz. goblet/tulip hybrid looking glass.

A: Pours a still dark brown with a small off white head that recedes quickly. Not the prettiest looking beer in the world.

S: Im just getting some yeasty and solid wheat notes in the nose. A slight spice of clove.

T: The taste reaffirms the nose. Same yeast and wheat notes, banana and bubblegum with a touch of clove and a little malt.

M: Prickly carbonation with a medium body. Easy to drink.

758,"2012-06-20",3.9,"The aroma was cut short by being served without the traditional dunkelwiezen head. Not sure if this is how it is served there but I def missed it. I was able to find the hint of close with esters of banan, and a breay aroma accompanied by a  little caramel and lil to no hop character.

Again the appearance was cut short without that thick almsot mousy head I was expecting but the color and was tride and true as most dunkelweizen should be. The haziness due to the protein in the wheat and suspended yeast was good.

As far as mouthfeel it had a medium full body aided by the wheat and yeast giving it almost a fluffy, creamy, fullness. There was a great richness that I assume came from the malts

Spectacularly well-constructed brewpub dunkelweizen, though not approaching the greatness of their Hefe.

I like:
Not all that pretty dark brown. Strongly estery nose loaded with banana purée, but also grainy toast, woodsy grapes, earth cherries. Quite fruity in the genre and not as roasty as I would have thought, more dust than actual roast flavours from the creative yeast strain. Full-bodied.

Feels less clean than the regular hefe, more powdery, more wet, dustier. Almost too carbonated, biting. The head departs far quicklier than the hefe’s.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Enjoyed the stronger spicy accents... medium-bodied with boatloads of flavor.. smooth middle.  World-class concoction here!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

758,"2007-01-23",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pours a medium brown with a small beige head.  Bananas and clove dominate along with traces of wheat and bubblegum.  Well done.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ElBorracho"
758,"2007-01-15",3.7,"Darned decent dunkelweizen.  Its a cloudy dark chestnut brew with a bubbly, quickly disappearing tan head.  It smells of aging bananas, dark caramel, wheat, and clove.  Fairly smooth & creamy drinking.  The flavors much the same as the aroma except that the bananas seem just a little older.  Very good.<font size=-4>Imbibed at the <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/events-detail.asp?eve Monthly Chicago RateBeerian Gathering at <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

758,"2007-01-13",4.0,"Nice, banana, wheat aroma. Dark, reddish orange with no head. Very nice color. Excellent Dunkel weiss as is reflected in the style percentile. I cant remember having a better Dunkel Weiss in Germany, and as such Jonathan Cutler did an outstanding job crafting this brew. Very nice beer.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
758,"2007-01-08",3.8,"On tap.Pours a hazy, creamy chestnut brown with rather thin off-white head. Intense brown-sugar malt aroma with notes of banana, clove, pumpernickel bread, and splash of citrus, Flavor almost exactly as the aroma suggests, only not quite as intense as the aroma. Still pretty flavorful though. Rather full-bodied for a hefe with a solid, creamy palate. Very, very nice.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"
758,"2007-01-05",4.0,"One of the best Dunkels Ive had. Bananas and wheat predominate, but there is a nice appleish presence as well. Thick and hearty.","Detroit, Michigan, USA","JoshuaB"
758,"2006-12-09",4.0,"On tap at Piece
This was a bit pricy at $6 but the pour was generous.  It took over twenty minutes to drink despite the fact it was so good I would have easily polished it off without trying.  I can understand why Piece is one of the up and coming small brewpubs.  Now if they can work on that whole overcrowding thing they had going on when I was there.
Aroma / Appearance - Banana, wheat, cherries and caramel highlight an attractive looking body.  It was hard to get too many details due to the low light but it seemed to be a dark brown with a mocha colored head.  Overall both the appearance and nose were very nice.
Flavor / Palate - Wheat, rye and cherries hit the palate first.  After that came caramelly nutty flavors.  The finish was sweet but not overly so.  Overall the balance was well done.  If it werent for the fact they are $6 each I could easily have drunk these all night.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
758,"2006-10-28",3.7,"Tried a quick sample of this one.  Spicy banana-wheat with decent body and smooth finish.  Im not a big wheat guy, but this one is tasty and full of flavor.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
758,"2005-12-26",3.1,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of medium sized mostly diminishing light brown colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing.  The body contained soft carbonation, was opaque and brown in color.  Its aroma contained notes of good dunkel weizen style with crisp smoky malty fruity .  Its mouth feel is initially tingly with a lingering  tingly palate and a aftertaste.  Its flavor contained maltfruit mild banana mild brown malt mild spice notes.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
758,"2005-10-04",3.6,"Very nicely done hefe...Huge aromas wafting out of my pint...bubblegum, banan, clove...Nice rich smooth chewy wheat texture (They got this one down just about right)  Even bigger flavors of banana/cloves/bread  dough/ cut grass/ pepper/ and citrus (orange and lemon) hops.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
758,"2005-04-06",3.7,"yes, this beer does pack banana flavor, which i tend to enjoy more in a typical hefe than in a dunkelweizen, but i enjoyed this.  served in a very bulbous weizen glass","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SkyinBrian"
758,"2005-04-06",3.8,"Deep brown with a nice fluffy head that lasts. Pleasant spicy banana aroma. Tastes like liquid Bananas Foster coupled with cloves. The thing I like about Pieces weizens is that they are heavy and have a big body, which is important, to me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
758,"2005-02-20",2.5,"Draft at Piece Brewery & Pizzeria. Poured a small tan head that was mostly lasting, fine-small sized bubbles, sparse lacing, hazy, and a brown hue. Aroma was malty, banana and clove. Flavor was malty and some banana. Mouthfeel was smooth. Medium body. Disappointing for this style of beer.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
758,"2005-02-17",4.0,"Hazy, rustic purple brown with a thick, persistent tan head.  Big, estery nose of banana, clove, cocoa, wheatabix and a touch of bubblegum.  The body is full and satisfying without being overly filling or too much.  Nice, elegant flavors show tremendous, fruity depth and a bit of wheaty smoothness.  An excellent example of this style.  Piece makes tremendous wheat beers.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
758,"2005-02-07",4.5,"On draft at the brewery.  A really sweat and pheonelic offering that really hits what a good Dunkel should be.  Above average head size sits atop a deep brown/red beer that hits you in the face with its fruity/spicey aroma reminiscent of Wrigleys Juiceyfruit gum.  The flavor is equally compelling with a strong note of banana and malt. Really nice and a must try.","Palos Heights, Illinois, USA","EddieG"
758,"2005-02-07",4.4,"Draft: Plum chocolate. Opaque. Oversized foam puff produces impeccable lacework. Extravagant aroma of clove-dusted pears, peppery phenols, chocolate, banana, bubblegum, and herbal hops. Appropriately feisty carbonation, yet fluffily creamy and full at the same time. Early acidic thrust deepens the rich breadiness and spicy esters. Explosive to say the least, with an enormous cakey malt spine being flawlessly highlighted by coarse chalkiness. Well-placed phenols and vaporous clove heat ensues, compounding the briskly dry edge. Transitions effortlessly into a hearty center of chocolate, spiced passionfruit, and more bready lushness. Peppery phenols and herbal hops spawn more dryness while extremely bright whole clove notes give way to a captivating array of body-sustaining doughy yeast and baked plantains. In the land of weizenbier, few do it as well as Piece. Awe-inspiring stuff, here.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
758,"2005-01-31",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2005 I had this again during this visit and liked it as much if not more than the first time. A wonderfully example of the style---Original Review: Tap and served in an Aventinus styled glass (nice touch): Murky coppery brown hue with a nice off-white creamy head and very good lace.  The aroma has notes of banana, clove, lemongrass esters with a good carmelized malt background, a bit earthy too. The taste is very true to style with equal parts weizen and dunkel working together for balance. Crisp fruity character on top of sweet malts with lingering acidic and spicy tones. The feel is sharp and refreshing, even if a bit heavy and doughy towards the end. I liked this a lot and would recommend to any weizen fan.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
758,"2005-01-22",4.1,"Draught 2005 version: mahogany with orange hues, rocky head that slowly dies into a light tan cream.  Dark roasted (and fruity) clove aromatics that match well with the caramelized banana esters, subtle yeast, sugary toffee and bubble gum.  Spicy palate  sugar coated pepper crumbs and whole cloves (which seem to have been pulled from an orange after being soaked and boiled in a pot of apple cider)  Bready/doughy finish that leaves me wanting, just as much as the other Curvy beer","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
