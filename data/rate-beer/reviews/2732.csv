2732,"2015-10-06",3.7,"Bomber purchased at brewpub. Rich straw pour with modest head. A bit sweeter nose than your typical lager. Banana and spice. Clean lager flavor with nice hoppy lemon and zesty notes along with spicy earth. Real nice middleground is met between hoppiness and cleanliness. A crushable offering.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","mambossa"

2732,"2015-06-30",3.3,"Bottle @ RBSG 2015. Clear yellow pour with white foam. Has some nice fruity esters and citrusy hop notes. A good bit of floral and grassy character, too. Some lime seltzer, biscuit, and perhaps tea. Nice crisp malt flavor and a moderate bitterness. Not overly sweet. Kind of dusty. Was hoping for better.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2732,"2015-06-21",3.2,"22 oz. bottle, pours a hazy yellow blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings biscuity malt out upfront, with piney hops in there. Flavour brings out lots of piney and herbal hops, with grass and biscuity malt to back. Nothing special to be honest, but well-made.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

A: Clear gold with a thin white and some lacing. 

N: Grass, pine, dirt, damp leaves, cracker, some peppercorn, little to no citrus

T: Bitter with light maltiness. 

M: Medium body, lightly resinous, no alcohol presence. 

O: A throttled down version of Dreadnaught, which youll notice I dont much enjoy. This has that same dead hop presence as Dreadnaught, and its average at best.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
