4223,"2017-03-24",2.9,"Looks beautiful, with a deep purple. Not much head. Ok, so I get quite a bit of berry but also a fair bit of butyric. Fuck. On the palate, lots of berry, and a fair bit of tartness. The fruit lends a fair bit of sugars. The butyric isnt really there on the palate, so you can certainly drink it. But it is a bit harsh in the finish in terms of its acidity.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

The flavor has good fruity tartness and a hint of bread. Very light bodied. Tasty stuff, but if theres gonna be this much fruit character, it probably needs a bit more body.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

Nose of sweet berry, that signature de Garde lacto and funk mix, oak barrel, touch of chewable vitamins, smells amazing. The taste is no slouch either.

4223,"2015-03-08",4.1,"750ml shared by Levi. Purple red body. Purple-red tinged head. Big fruity tones match and complement the sour quite well. The sour is pleasantly not acetone tinged or vinegar. The boysenbery is super pronounced, making this quite a unique experience. More fruit beer than sour, but still lots of sour yeast. Great.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4223,"2014-12-27",3.4,"750ml bottle, had thsi in a blind taste test with 9 other fruits, guessed 6 out of 9, missed the marion, boysen, and cherry raz for obvious reasons in perception of these rare fruits.

4223,"2014-11-27",4.0,"A- pours an Ocean Spray CranRasberry red. Delicate pink head that thins quickly. Very light lacing. 

S- lemons, grass, cranberry and boysenberry pie filling are all forward. Lots of berry jam. Some sour oak mustiness but fairly concealed. 

M- light tart body that goes down like a watery fruit juice. 

T- aromas set the precedent and flavors follow suit. Lemon head candies and very tart berries first. More grasses and dank wood. Light pepper, herbal and lacto qualities. A lot of water and acidic notes that drown out any subtle jam.

Not very complex but not necessarily to a fault. Could have used a little more fruit to generate a more present flavor.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"

4223,"2014-09-28",3.7,"[ Bottle ][ ½ of 75cl ][ Tasting ][ Trade ][ Snifter ][ 9.25.14 ]Translucent dark raspberry body, puffy pink head drops fast, thin cap, tepid appearance. The berry nose reminds of peppery grape, lightly spicy fennel element, light lime and chemical. Juicy front palate, jammy with light seed, the fennel elements returning mid with more citric acid that dominates, all together very well-rounded. The full bodied finish is too fizzy, reducing it to a high acid citric finish, tons of dry skin all over the mouth, sticky and biting, so fizzy it numbs the tongue.[ 9.25 Tasting Ranking ] 01.
