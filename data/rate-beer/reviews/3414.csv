Pours a darker brownish ruby hue, a good hazy darker middle with ruby reddish twilight glow on the edges and bottom. Frothy offwhite head atop stays as a firmer frothy layer, not full but sufficient, a thicker ringer laces nicely. Aromas are potent sour and stone fruit, plum and dried dark fruit meet fleshy black cherry, firmer lactic sour jabs. Earth, a bit of toast and tannic whiskey barrel and oak sneaks in. Some vanillin, earth with more cherries, pomegranate, yogurt. A potent sour zing on the nose is quite appealing. Initial is medium bodied, a bit more full, an alluring dark and stone fruit appeal gives this plum, black cherry, and fleshy dark fruit. Touches of pomegranate, nectarine and some citric tartness flow into a bit of biscuit, earth, gentle sweetness. Rich luscious dark plum stays firm with some decent sourness, a bit of yogurt. More reeled in than some of their other darker sours but still sour, a potent dark and fleshy stone fruit life really makes this appealing. Touches of vanilla, tannic oak, yogurty sourness presses on. A bit of toast, dark fruit and pit. Some plum, faint raisin and tapering sourness. The barrel here is more tame, a touch of lingering vanilla and gentle spiciness creeps up at times especially through the body and again on the finish. Red grapes, a bit of graphite and earthiness on the nose crops up at times. Perhaps a bit flabby at times but the flavors are impressive, the sourness firm but a bit more tapered than some of the other Crooked Stave offerings. I dig this, a gentle yeastiness, faint toast and lactic twangy life tapers out. I keep coming back to that fleshy plum. Tasty.

3414,"2014-05-26",3.6,"A muddy dark brown color with a smattering of khaki head on surface. Smells of sour, figs, vanilla, cinnamon, all spice, plum, funky barnyard, cola. Taste is a burst of sour with a vinegar taste, tart cherry, lime. The sourness dominates most of any other flavors that may be there. Smells are very interesting and doesn't represent the taste. As a sour it is interesting especially in the aroma but I would like to see more flavors come out of the sourness. Medium velvety slick mouthfeel low carbonation. Good overall.

3414,"2014-04-11",4.1,"Rating #3600 - Pours quite dark brown with a reddish hue and a small beige head that leaves as quick as it comes. The aroma has dark berries, chocolate, bugginess, cream, black currants and smooth oakiness. The barrel seems to add nice traits, but not catching either the bourbon or boozy aspect at all. Medium / light body with with some light roughness and mild amount of sharp abrasive carbonation, Starts with a beautiful mix of tartness/berries mixed with smooth dark chocolate. There is lots of bugginess and graininess in there as well. Very dry and quite wine-like. In the finish there are light traces of whiskey, but very light. On the taste I dont notice any overt barrel qualities, but they are probably offering change Im not noticing. There is a touch of vanilla smoothness. This is an excellent sour ale that sure hides that higher alcohol in an amazing way.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
