2721,"2017-06-20",3.5,"Bottle from Thirsty, Cambridge. Light to mid-gold, hazy with a frothy and quickly dissipating white head. Light floral hops in the aroma with touches of lime peel and hay. Sweet taste, light and unbelievably refreshing. The finish is far drier and theres an acidity in the aftertaste that takes it down a notch for me. Otherwise its an outstanding hot weather beer.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

2721,"2017-05-26",3.8,"Keg at the Windsor Castle W8. Hazy orangey yellow colour, white foam. Doesnt look like a classic lager. Drinks really well, solid bready malts and a lovely rich melange of fruits, orange and some tropical/citrus notes, and spice from the hops. Medium but not overpowering bitterness. Very moreish. Would confuse the hell out of the BJCP but a very pleasant surprise this one.","Greater London, ENGLAND","JorgeLee"
2721,"2017-05-26",3.2,"Keg at Small Bar, shared with Finn. Warm, clear golden body, clingy lacing, low white head. Hints of grapefruit on the nose. Mid-sweet pale malts and grapefruit flavours. Rounded mouth feel. Clean and refreshing. (Bristol 01.05.2017).","Tromsø, NORWAY","Rune"
2721,"2017-05-14",4.1,"Bottle from Westhill Service Station. Pours clear copper gold with plenty bubbles and a tall fluffy white head. A peachy summer fruit nose with gentle pine bitterness and a soft caramel finish. Taste nicely amplifies the earthy bitterness and adds a light beery spice which is balanced beautifully against the sweet tropical notes and fresh citrus. A light palate with a crisp sparkle. The fantastic tropical tones pitched against a clean earthy bitterness make this a wonderfully different lager beer.","Aberdeen, SCOTLAND","rodsquad"

2721,"2017-04-23",3.6,"Lots of hoppy flavour for a lager yet very refreshing. Citric on the first sip but finishes with an almost tobacco dustiness. Smooth and easy-drinking but with plenty of character.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","TottenhamHopspur"

There is a crisp, tangy, fruity orange character to this, freshly hopped, just an easy amount of bitterness, light and hoppy. Lasts on the palate. Really pretty decent.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
2721,"2017-02-28",4.1,"Keg at the Mermaid - Clapton. Pours hazy gold with a a creamy, white head. Big hoppy character in the nose, bright citrus, tropical fruits, tangerine. Light-medium sweet flavour with lots of juicy tropical fruits, supporting pale bread, mango, peach, tangerine, mild bitterness. Light bodied with average carbonation. Finishes with a little resin, more vibrant citrusy hops, graoefruit, lemon rind, juicy tangerine, tropical accents, moderate pale bread sugars. This is awesome, although almost nothing here says lager, and certainly not Vienna lager. At any rate, this liquid is delicious.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

Poured a reddy black with small, tight off white head, not lots on the nose but pleasant roasty and hop aromas. Drank like an imperial dark lager, if such a thing exists.

2721,"2016-10-18",2.8,"Keg at Clove Hitch, Liverpool. As Lost And Grounded Running With Sceptres, 5.2%. Vibrant golden yellow, hazy and opaque, sparkling with a foamy white head. Aroma is mixed citrus, sickly fruits, souring melon and pineapple. Vibrant but weird and sickly. Body is light, tingly to spritzy carbonation. Taste is passionfruit, very fruity, peach, sherbet, mango. Sorry - I like the intensity of the fruit but this was just a sweet fizzy mess for me. I just wasnt a big fan and couldnt finish a third.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

2721,"2016-09-09",3.7,"Draught. Pours hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma is floral hops with piney undertones. Flavor is moderate-to-strong piney hops with a hint of citrus, and a malt backing reminiscent of a pilsener. Though this is a lager, which the brewer describes as a ""special lager"" and likens to a mix between a Pils and Vienna with a big whallop of hops added, honestly it reminds me more than anything of an American Pale Ale. And a pretty good one.","Falmouth, Cornwall, ENGLAND","Delirium"
