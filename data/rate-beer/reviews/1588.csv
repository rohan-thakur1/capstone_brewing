1588,"2012-12-08",3.4,"An obviously cloudy white body with a twinge of yellow to it.  A mild aroma of rice, yeast and some peach.  flavor was slightly similar to aroma, there was a little more of a peach flavor and some mild cucumber to it. Alcohol was a warming sense in the finish, but otherwise well hidden. A nice full mouth feel.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
