3149,"2017-01-26",3.9,"Bottle acquired in trade... Brilliant reddish purple in color... Aroma of cherry candy, raspberries... Flavor is maybe a little one dimensional, lots of tart cherries, some yogurt, funk on finish... A little formic acid solvent notes on palate... pretty nice, but not my favorite cherry sour

3149,"2016-09-17",4.6,"Un immense merci à Marc-André pour ce lambic américain! Ce verre est flamboyant! Le feu est littéralement pris dans mon verre. Un jus de cerises rouge vif qui pourrait facilement passer pour une jus de framboises. Mousse absente. Le liquide est nu devant moi et je me sens tout aussi nu devant lui tant je suis soumis à ses arômes. Un funk fabuleux de lambic, de cerise noire, de framboise, de cette culture bactérienne unique à Casey qui me chavire à chaque fois. Je mets quiconque au défi didentifier le pays dorigine de cette bière lors dune dégustation à laveugle. Une profondeur déroutante de lambic où la cerise taquine habilement le funk. Je pourrais boire de cette bière bière à linfini.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3149,"2015-08-26",4.0,"Bottle @ Aarons Wedding Eve Shindig. Pinkish red pour with a light pink head. Smells mostly of cherry pie with a nice lemony note and some mild yogurt funk. A good bit of spice, some green grape skin, and oak. A light funk to the flavor along with a pretty bright acidity and tons of cherry character. Sort of a tannic fruit skin quality and a dry finish. Nice citrusy tang and zest. Good stuff.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3149,"2015-08-20",4.1,"Bottle shared at my pre-wedding bash with some other RB nerds. Pours a hazy pink appearance with a pinkish / cream colored head. The aroma is full of spicy, herbal cherries that is reminiscent of cherry crisp. Theres an interplay between cinnamon-like spiciness and pie cherries. The cool thing about this is that base beer, Oak Theory, shines through brightly with all the cobweb / basement funk / cheesy notes readily apparent and not dominated by the cherries. The cherries are complementary not overpowering. Moderately sour. Delicious and a treat.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

3149,"2015-08-04",4.1,"750 ml bottle to snifter (shared with the Mrs; thanks @@ron). Bottled 3/20/15. Looks good; a cloudy bright cherry with white head that has a light pink hue to it and steadily dissipates into thin lacing. A bit of fine sediment towards the bottom of the bottle, but nothing excessive or offensive. Smells and tastes tart, oaky, and funky with a very nice cherry presence. Mouthfeel is medium-light to medium-bodied and pleasantly tart and lively. A great cherry take on the base.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
