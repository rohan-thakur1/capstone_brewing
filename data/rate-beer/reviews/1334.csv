1334,"2015-11-13",3.6,"Growler, slightly cloudy, deep amber beer, dense cream colored head faded to a skiff. Aroma sweet malt, coffee and yeast. Taste is caramel malt, if aint hint of coffee or roast, touch of honey or baked apple, faint dried fruit. Palate is rich and smooth, carbonation subdued and fine. This is a bit sweet in the middle, but that roastiness comes through right at the end to tone it down. Great beer for a 15F night. Wheres my kilt?!","Eagle River, Alaska, USA","furthur"

1334,"2009-10-09",3.3,"2009 batch on tap @ MS. Clear brown with a medium tan head. The aroma is roasted malt, caramel and some mild peppery hops. Flavor is mostly sweet rich malt with a light amount of bitterness, which balances it out nicely. Medium body with medium carbonation and a long roasty/smokey finish. Wow has my palate changed, I remember when this came out in the mid 90s and I thought it was really strong and intense. Still really good but almost a session beer for me now.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"

1334,"2007-04-10",3.7,"This scotch ale pours a deep cover color from a 22oz bottle. Medium sized tan foamy head. Aroma is malty, caramel a touch bready and sweet. A medium bodied scotch ale. Malts are caramel and fruity, slightly sweet and a touch peaty. Hops are earthy and perhaps a touch floral. Mild carbonation. Nice balance. Lots of malts, a touch of peat and smoke. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

Body starts with nice caramel sweetness with good toasty balance and some slightly earthy hops.  A pretty good Scottish ale.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

1334,"2006-11-17",3.8,"This is simply one of the best beers produced in the state of Alaska.  Alaska produces some extremely delicious beers, so that is no small compliment.","USA","iamsancho16"
1334,"2006-09-22",3.0,"Tasting at goldtwins 9/20/06 - Aroma of toffee, chocolate and dirty water.  Pours mudpuddle with no head or lacing.  Flavor matches aroma.  Palate is thin.  Not a very good scottish ale.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","MI2CA"
1334,"2006-09-22",3.3,"The beer poured a hazy brownish copper with a thin beige head.  Somewhat fruity aroma with a decent amount of chocolate.  The flavor matched the aroma except a little more chocolate and some tartness.  Medium bodied.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1334,"2005-12-26",4.4,"This bottled brew poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized mostly lasting light brown colored bubbles excellent sheet lacing.  The body contained no visible carbonation, was very hazy semi-opaque and dark brown in color.  Its aroma contained notes of nice malty semi-vinous sweet .  Its mouth feel is initially very tingly with a lingering  tingly palate and a very nice chocolate aftertaste that fades into the finish.  Its flavor contained very nice malty sweet mild hop flavorful chocolate brown malty notes and was very tasty.  Nicely done!  Excellent brew.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1334,"2005-11-14",3.0,"Reddish brown pour with a short lasting fizzy white head. Wet vegetable, sweet tobacco, nuts, and slightly roasted aroma. Mouthfeel is a tad watery and dry. Light roast, sweet malts, and almost greenish flavors. Cloying on the tounge and somewhat stomach turning. As a wee heavy this doesnt register to be real high in the alcohol catagory to me. Or at least its well hidden. I would be interested to know what the alcohol content of this brew is. In the end this is just ok. However, I need to thank a co worker who thought of me in her recent trip to Alaska!","North Dakota, USA","mybrainhurts"
1334,"2005-08-23",1.8,"Well, it smells atrocious (my sister says butthole). Taste is nicer at first, but certianly not outstanding. Its pretty malty with faint hops. After this inauspicious start, however, this guy turns for the worse, shows its funky nasty side. I did notice at the end that bottle stated on the side that it was bottled in Jun of 01, which may be the cause of this poor rating.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
1334,"2005-08-12",2.7,"Tart earthy, malty aroma with some vanilla and caramel. Clear red with a tan head. Clean, sweet malty flavor with a light berry note. Finishes a little sour with a vegetable taste. I think this bottle is about to go bad.","austin, Texas, USA","biz82"
1334,"2005-08-11",3.6,"Dark mahogany brown with a nice-size head that gradually fades to a weather pattern. Rich, malty aroma. Cookies and maple syrup. A touch of oxidation. Rich, malty body. Pretty good.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1334,"2005-07-22",3.5,"Tap @ Humpys. Nice peach in the aroma, along with some hops. Clear, dark brown pour, with no head (why do they never let tap pours have any head?). Sweet, balanced, full taste, but posessing a rather unpleasant dank basement-style finish. Medium body.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1334,"2005-04-07",3.9,"Thanks to jsquire for sharing this at his beer tasting. Small tan creamy and smooth head that was mostly lasting, fine-large sized bubbles, sparse lacing, and a copper brown hue. Aroma was alcohol, sweet and some mild caramel. Flavor was malty, sweet and vinuous. Mildly tingly mouthfeel. Medium body. Very quaffable and worth trying.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
1334,"2005-03-22",3.8,"This was sampled from a bomber bottle I brought back from AK.  Deep brownish amber color with a large, foamy tan head that subsided to a strong bead around the edge of the glass.  Very inviting nose of red wine and alcohol.  I would not have been able to pick this as a scottish ale.  Lots of fruitiness up front with apples and cherries with some sweet chocolate in the finish.  Very easy drinking beer and very enjoyable for a style I tend not to like very much.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
1334,"2004-09-07",3.5,"Purchased at the brewery in Anchorage. Deep, dark ruby red appearance with a very thick, creamy, toffee colored head. Aroma is at first phenolic, but when you really concentrate it is pleasantly sweet like extra sweet cookie dough with some liquor soaked dates. Flavor is very sweet and malty with some candy sweetness and some molasses in the back end. Very creamy mouthfeel. Would make a good winter warmer in the long Alaskan winter.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1334,"2003-09-19",3.0,"Big beige head atop a dark amber body.  Aroma is sweet, earthy, light caramel, a wee bit mediciny.  Taste is medium sweet, caramel, bready, slightly earthy, hint of peat.  Finish is stronger peat, but aftertaste is minimal.  Medium body, lightly sticky.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1334,"2002-10-20",3.7,"Very red, almost amber.  Smells sweet, good body.  I cant believe only 2 other people have rated this.  A dominating Scottish Ale, brings back memories of the Big Bossmans dominance during 80s WWF.","Colorado, USA","Under-age Drinker"
1334,"2002-10-13",4.0,"Poured with a monster head.  A sweet aroma doesnt tip you to the bready flavor that comes along.  A meal in a glass.  Good.","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
1334,"2002-05-14",3.1,"Head is initially small, fizzy, off-white, fully diminishing. Body is
medium reddish-brown. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel, toasted light
bread), with a light note of toffee. Flavor is moderately sweet,
moderately bitter, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately bitter,
moderately acidic. Medium to full body, creamy texture, lively
carbonation. The aroma is pretty light and simple in my sample, but
still pleasant. Its rather sour, but balanced well otherwise.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
