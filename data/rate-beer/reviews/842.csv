842,"2017-05-13",3.7,"Aroma:

Slight/medium aroma of malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, fruit, bread, hops and spices.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque amber/orange beer with a slight/medium off-white/beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, Belgian yeast and fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with bread, hops and spices. 

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Not really that strong for its abv to be honest, but it is still a rather complex taste that does not fail to deliver. Great appearance and palate as well, but the aroma could have been stronger.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

842,"2016-12-04",3.4,"75cl bb12/2018 courtesy du brasseur at BBF 2016, merci. ""hop-bursted Imperial Pilsner"" translates into: closing the gap between DIPA (mango marmelade), Belgian pils with heavy esters, heller Bock (marzipan and apricot starchy malt body, drenched madeleines). Dirty mid parts, almost meaty proteins with a certain oily, seductive power (illusion of chewiness). Somewhere, FantÃ´meÂ’s happenstance je-mÂ’en-foutisme peeks in to say ""To Hell with all those juicy US hop oils"", adding quark, cheese and peach jam.

842,"2016-07-28",4.0,"Odd choice for a winter beer, but fair enough mid summer now and spot on on what I wanted. Modern hops, also grassy, very nice. Cake and biscuit malt backup, nice sweaty sweetness given the style. Not clean per se but rather crisp still, especially in the taste, with a sharp bitterness and equal carbonation. Yummy!

842,"2016-03-20",3.3,"One of these new, limitedly produced Brabant craft beers; strong gusher, beer spouted out of the bottle neck upon opening. Very thick and rocky, Â’paperyÂ’, snow white, lacing head over a hazy golden blonde beer with slightly peachy hue. Â’RuralÂ’ aroma of dried flowers, unripe peach, dry earth, bakerÂ’s yeast, apple peel, straw, old cheese, clove-like phenols, bread crust, potato peel, dried ground ivy. Restrained fruitiness in the mouth (apple peel, green banana, dried apricot, unripe gooseberry but everything in a very subdued way and neither explicitly sweet nor sourish), soft carbo becoming even flatter as the bottle progresses, clearly the carbon dioxide was not (yet?) Â’lockedÂ’ into the beer. Middle phase has very bready and grainy, vaguely sweetish malts and a hint of soapy and lightly sourish wheat, as well as a velvety effect from the oats. Finish adds some warming Â’jeneverÂ’-like alcohol, rather badly hidden actually, as well as an earthy yeastiness and grassy and peppery hop bitterishness. Weird beer, and I do not see how this is an Â’imperialÂ’ or any other kind of Pilsener: I assume lager yeast has indeed been used, but maybe at a higher temperature than usual for the style, and perhaps lacking sufficient cold lagering afterwards. This is, in appearance, aroma and taste, actually way closer to a saison... Interesting for sure, but technically far from perfect. I applaud this breweryÂ’s venturing in modern international craft beer styles, but again I have to conclude that even though the ideas are fascinating, they need a lot more technical fine-tuning.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Sweet and grainy. Unmistakable Belgian yeastiness. Taste is oily, hoppy bitter. Background, grainy sweetness. Lots of body. Soft chew. Long, fruity, big hop, chewy bitter finish. Easy pils. Big hop. Nothing to dislike!","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"

842,"2015-12-21",3.7,"At Kerstbierfestival 2015. Pours unclear blonde, small white head. Smell is yeasty, bit sweet. touch of Â’wortÂ’ . Taste is bitter, nicely Â’warmÂ’ by the aspect of what seems to me like unfinished fermentation. This actually taste like wort, a little bit. Very hoppy as well. the result - as it was when served - was, to my idea not finished. i am curious what it will be when the rest of the fermentation has been done. Appart from that, I really liked the taste of it as it was today. thereÂ’s Always a chance IÂ’m really off, and this Ã­s fully fermented, which is far from bad with a taste like this.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
