194,"2015-11-28",4.1,"(can) Had this awhile back in growler form, but now trying it out of the new cans. Pours jet black with a large dark tan head that lingers. Aroma right away is a pleasant mixture of roasted peanuts and chocolate that yields an olfactory effect of peanut butter cups. Some dark roasted coffee as well (probably Sumatran considering the peanut scent). The case could be made for mocha as well. This smells solid, but there are a few little unwanted pops of smoked meat scents (bacon) that crop up which interrupt the sweet decadence going on the aroma. The flavor is a huge slap of chocolate covered espresso bean (definite mocha vibes here), dark fruit (thinking plum/prune), roasted malt, and salted peanut that leads to a finish of smoked meat that is immediately followed by a hit of nondeScript hops that add nothing flavorful to the mix and merely serve to break off the sweetness in the mid and fore palate. Overall this is just as good as I remember it being, and its certainly a plus to be able to purchase a growler-sized sample of this beer at what I assume to be a cheaper price than an actual growler, as nothing was lost during the manufacture and canning of this beverage. I will definitely buy this again.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

194,"2009-01-22",3.5,"In short: A smooth creamy chocolaty porter.  Nothing groundbreaking but this is an above average example of the style.
How: Hand-bottle from MatSciGuy.  Huge thanks Levi for this special treat.  Consumed fresh a week after receiving it.
The look: Black body topped by a small tan head
In long: The very nice nose is heavily focussed black coffee with some chocolate cake in the back.  In mouth its the other way around with the black cake dominating the roasted coffee beans.  The smooth and round rich chocolaty maltiness is really more akin to a chocolate cake than pure bitter black chocolate.  Low hops presence.  The high roastiness develops into astrigency.  The body was a bit lifeless but Im not gonna take away any points since I was drinking from a homemade hand-bottled that had travelled from Minnesota to Montreal.  This was an unexpected nice surprise to get this hand-bottle out of the blue that I couldnt get otherwise since Im never out of the blue, Im always in the red.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

194,"2008-06-27",3.8,"hand bottle from stine... opaque dark brown nearly black pour with a thin light brown head and spotty lacing. big cheesy creamy aroma followed by chocolate, dark roasty grain and coffee. the flavor is roasty and not too sweet combined with more coffee, dark chocolate, grain astringency, cream and grassy herbal hops. sourness on the finish. medium to full bodied but astringency keeps in easy to drink. 

no one has mentioned the cheese character in this which leads me to believe its somewhat infected? maybe im just hypersensitive to it? idk.  strangely though, it works... still, id love to try this fresh! thanks eben for taking down another from my list!","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

The flavor consisted of burnt malts, strong coffee, chocolate, caramel, and some warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and smooth with very light carbonation.

194,"2007-12-31",3.8,"Growler shared with and courtesy of Degarth. For some reason I kept calling this one Hard Eight Porter in my head. Then I remembered it was a beer, not a Janet Evanovich novel. Pour is black as night, completely opaque and very viscous. Huge creamy mocha head settles on top and has incredible retention and lasting. Resolves to a layer of thick foam atop the beer. Looks like an Imp Stout. Nose of BBQ smoke, tobacco leaves, cocoa powder, dark malts, licorice, molasses and dark fruity esters. Flavor profile is similar, but adds in a good amount of hoppy bite and roasty bitterness. Medium bodied, very creamy mouthfeel. Huge, lengthy finish is heavily astringent, then in turns bitter and sweet before trailing off. Astringency is almost overwhelming for the first few sips, but it either fades as the beer breathes or you become numb to it. Great porter.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

I was just getting used to this one, when along came the waitress, unbidden, with free samples of Alfreds Porter, their step above, weighing in at 14%!
Ill try a full sample of that, next time, if I can, but Ill look forward to this every visit!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
194,"2003-08-14",3.5,"Color is very, very dark solid brown, nearly black with a thin tannish-cocoa brown head that fades to a thin ring and small sheets of lacing. Smell is a good sense of dark roastyness and chocolate with a good coffee backing which seems to pick up and become more evident as it warms. Taste comes across way to soon and very uneven of coffee, chocolate and bittering hops, very unbalanced, almost enough for it to be enjoyable. The alcohol of 8% makes an appearance far to soon and is what really makes the flavors falter, it seems to get in the way of any taste.The finish is tolerable with light lingering dark fruits and sweet malts. Its overbearing in the start making this very hard to enjoy or finish. The richness trying to poke through is bogged down by uneven chocolaty bitterness that just never settles or shines like a good chocolate should and the coffee flavor seems like its a week old in pot with only about an inch of liquid left in it. Didn't like this one, seems like it could be better, perhaps next time I'm in at Barley John's I'll try it again sense it is a year round tap.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

194,"2003-02-13",3.9,"One of the top brews offered at Winterfest in St. Paul, MN on Feb. 8. Faint alcohol aroma with hints of chocolate. Completely opaque. Served extremely cold; probably too cold for a porter. Flavorful and rich; alcohol was not too overwhelming. Very excellent.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
