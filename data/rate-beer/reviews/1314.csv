1314,"2011-02-02",3.7,"Draft at PP Carlsbad Barrel Blast 2010.  Cloudy brown pour.  Grapey, chocolate, sweetness, oak, bourbon, and a bit of fruit.  Meh its fine, but after the BA moloko, so it was not as good as that.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
1314,"2011-01-22",3.8,"On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbads Barrel Blast. Pours with a muddy purple to brown body with a tan head. Aromas of bourbon, earthy, peppery, chocolate, wood, alcohol and whiskey. Flavors are earthy, light acidity, woody, woodsie. Light bubbles with some notes of the berries in the finish.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

1314,"2011-01-16",3.6,"Pours a watery chocolate milk with a very thin lacing on the edges. Smells like a port, chocolate and berries, bourbon and malts tied together with molasses. Tastes like a port aged in bourbon barrels with some hops added in for bitterness. The mouthfeel is very thin, just like the appearance suggests, it ahas the same consistency as watered down chocolate milk.","San Diego, California, USA","playitbybeer"
1314,"2011-01-15",3.6,"The beer looks like the chocolate river in Willy Wonkas factory..opaque, brown, and yet with a magical or (weird) whitish glow.  The head was just a thin ring.  Nose of toffee, chocolate, and bourbon.  Carbonation was a bit on the high side yet the body seemed a bit thin, thus giving impressions of watered down chocolate and bourbon, though certainly more chocolate than bourbon.  Some toffee shows up in the flavors too and even a bit of some tartness, but not really...but maybe..influence of the berries, I reckon.  It takes a little time to warm up to this beer, but it happens a bit with some time...the thinness starts to disappear and it starts to consume more of the palate. Overall, not bad..""decent"" i suppose is the word.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1314,"2010-12-22",3.7,"FoBAB.  Pours murky brown with tan head.  Nose of caramel, chocolate, berries, and light bourbon.  Flavor has hints of all of the above, well done.","","User29624"
1314,"2010-12-07",4.0,"Tasted on draft at FoBAB 2010.  Pours muddy dark amber with a huge light brown head that slowly dies down to leave rocky lace.  The nose is caramel malt, lots of chocolate and dark berry fruits.  The flavor is chocolate and caramel malt with an unidentifiable fruitiness (that must be Marion Berry now that I am reading the description).  The body is medium plus with lively carbonation and a long carob finish.  As I contemplate this beer, I notice that the bourbon is present on both the nose and the palate, but it is very well integrated due to the fruitiness of the brew.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
1314,"2010-11-09",4.0,"Sample at FOBAB 2010.  Pours a muddy brown color with reddish tints and a finger-thick tan head that sticks for a while.  Notes of vanilla, berries, bourbon, wood, milk chocolate, and creamy caramel.  Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a milk chocolaty mouthfeel with some berry tartness in the distant background.  Definitely all over the place and not much Robert the Bruce character can be picked out of this one.  But still a very cool beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1314,"2010-11-08",3.6,"Draft at FoBAB 8. Pours a ruddy brown, slightly murky. Nose is fruity and tart, some vanilla and raspberry notes. Really interesting nose. Some chocolate as well. on taste, round and sweet with quite a nice tart note that shows that the blackberries are in here. Somehow, manages to taste fresh, but the tartness is a bit overwhelming in the end. Still, very interesting and cool.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1314,"2010-11-08",3.7,"Sampled at FoBAB 2010.   Murky brown pour.  Strong oak aroma, lots of bourbon and toffee, evident sweetness from the berries,  The peaty, richness of the malt base of Robert the Bruce peaks through the barrel and the berries.  Flavor displays the soft sweetness of the berries enveloped in vanilla, caramel, toffee, and bourbon.  Alcohol flavor is very muted.  Nice experiment in barrel aging from Three Floyds.  I enjoyed it.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
1314,"2010-11-07",3.7,"Sampled at FoBAB 2010 (Chicago, IL). Pours a murky brownish copper hue, huge caked light brown head, laces well, stays big. Aromas are caramel, toffee, some peaty malts, chocolate, vanilla, light oak and bourbon spirit. Initial is medium bodied, mellow toffee and caramel, chocolate, toffee, vanilla, touches of light berry and bitter tannin, rich oak and bourbon spirit. Nice, warming, a bit vague, mellow sweetness, rich bourbon, vanilla, sweet toffee, caramel. Nice. Big frothy head throughout. The barrel added a nice flavor element without being too hot on spirit. Tasty. Almost exactly what one would expect from Barrel Aged RtB with some berry appeal.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1314,"2010-11-04",3.6,"draft at the brewery, pours dark ruby with tan head around the rim. nose has nice bourbon, port, and berries with a vanilla and slightly bretty funk to it. flavors are bourbon caramilzed malt hints of booze and ash with red berries/port jammy sourness finishes seems like an infection but i think it works in the end.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
1314,"2010-11-04",3.3,"Three floyds chocolate city. On tap at Fff served in a small tulip  
styled glass...pours a murkly mostly dense muddy toffee brown with a  
light khaki head with almost a pinkish hue to it... Semi-sweet  
bourbony nose upfront followed up with raspberries. A decent meshing  
of scents that work well with each other... Flavors are highlighted  
with red berries sweet upfront but slowly convert to a soft sourness.  
Some bourbon, vanilla, and coconut interplay with the mix. The  
raspberries almost take a medicinal bent initially but the barrel  
manages to curtail its influence which saves the beer from becoming  
too cloying.

1314,"2010-10-31",3.8,"Draft sample at Three Floyds 
Hmmm, not what I expected.  Theres really not much chocolate in here, if any at all.  It contains large quantities of dark fruit and Bourbon, maybe some vanilla. Seems to be alot going on here but I think it works quite well with the base beer.  The finish is slightly tart.  Interesting and unique.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"
1314,"2010-10-31",2.5,"Tap: Poured a deep muddy brown with reddish and purple highlights topped by a fading head and little lace. Honestly, an ugly looking brew. The aroma is utterly confusing, I get more vanilla and bourbon than anything like chocolate, perhaps a bit of cocoa nibs but that is it. The malt profile on the nose is more caramel/crystal and roast with a very berry fruit component. The taste is far better thankfully with a lush malt overtone of toasted bread, bakers chocolate, charred malt and some biscuit with a raspberry and watermelon fruitiness. The bourbon barrel comes through more on the finish but is very even handed and complements the flavors. The mouth feel is soft and slightly sticky, there is a moderate alcohol tale of Fruit Liquor more than Bourbon. A hit and miss effort, in the end the bad outweighs the good IMO.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1314,"2010-10-29",3.8,"On tap at FFF. Poured a murky muddy brown with a purple hue and a large tan purplish head that dissipated very slowly to the edges. Aroma was full of chocolate with tart berries and a hint of backing bourbon. Flavor began with chocolate and grains with a growing tart berry. There wasnt much bourbon on the tongue. Beer was nice and smooth in the tongue.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1314,"2010-10-27",4.1,"On tap at the fff brewpub. Pours a hazy kind of chocolate milk brown with a reddish tint and a light tan cocoa head. Huge chocolate aroma with a hint of berry. Taste is a great blend of chocolate and tart berry. Most chocolate I get in beer is dark, roasty, bittersweet but this is much more classic milk chocolate. Tartness of the marion berries spikes in the middle with a bit of bourbon spice and is accented by a great chocolate finish that lasts and lasts. As you exhale from the sip you get a smooth chocolate rasberry (cheese cake) ghost. Awesome to get to check this out.","chicago, Illinois, USA","rateyourpoison"
1314,"2010-10-25",3.6,"Tap at fff. Pours a dirty ruby red brown with a tiny dirty head.  Aroma of muddled bourbon, booze, cherries, and vanilla.  Flavor is creamy fruity cherry jam mixed with cocoa vanilla  bourbon.  Creamy mouthfeel.  Booze is nice compiment.  Cherries and boiurbon are a muddled mixture rather than shining independantlý.  Tasty though, and interesting.  Original robert the bruce is dominated.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"

1314,"2010-10-23",3.9,"On tap at FFF - pours a dark cloudy brown/amber with a very modest head - Big bourbon barrel aromas coupled with rasberries. The bourbon elements seem to dissipate with the rise in temperature, as the chocolate, rasberry, and huge malts come into play. This brew is fantastic, rasberries hit you at the front and the back - and yes: im a huge rasberry fan. fantastic.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
