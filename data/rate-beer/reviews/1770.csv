Amber, moderate hazy body, with a big, creamy, lacing, yellowish head.
Aroma of bread, citrus, orange, flowers, some berries, biscuit.
Taste follows this, with some more honey.
Medium, a bit oily mouthfeel, with an average carbonation.
Finishes bitter-sweet, medium zesty, hoppy, a bit fruity, a bit bready.

Nice one. A quite unique and characterful style example. Good balance between biscuity malts and fruity-floral hops. Really quaffable, would definitely drink this again.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
