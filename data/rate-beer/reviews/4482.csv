Yikes, the taste almost reaches the heights of the super good and style specific smells. 

Caramel malt and brown sugar sweet notes dominate but fall far below the ""this is too sweet"" category. There are definitely some chocolate, perhaps of the semi sweet kind going on that add just a touch of bitterness. The Port I mentioned in the smell is there but a bit muted. 

Close to full bodied without being cloying.

4482,"2015-02-09",4.3,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a murky, cloudy medium-dark brown, almost like hot 65%-75% chocolate that has been partially frozen so that its still mostly liquid, but slushy. Forms little to no head, and leaves no lacing on the glass at all. A very mud-puddle sort of aesthetic.

Smell: Sweetness leaps out of the glass, gloves on, mouthguard in, ready to open with a faked leg sweep into a haymaker. Dark stone fruit notes hang in the malty haze like ripe plums suspended in a fruitcake.

Taste: Woo! When served cold, this is like sipping on pure malt syrup, all sweetness, toffee, and a bit of booze! As it warms up, more flavors emerge, revealing notes of cooked raisin, black currant, baked ginger - this beer becomes a liquid fruitcake, soaked in rum. The finish leaves a lingering tone of toffee and an almost rum-based liquor.

Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy, this beer sticks to every mouth surface and does not give way easily.

Overall: Not my favorite eisbock, as the Aventinus eisbock is a tough act to follow. However, it is pretty darned tasty, loaded with a depth that cool temperatures can mask. Id repeat this beer, were I to stumble upon it on tap anywhere, or find it on a shelf in a place where the Aventinus were not available.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"
