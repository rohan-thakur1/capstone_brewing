2581,"2013-12-01",2.7,"Bottled August 2011 (~2.4 years old), bottle number 05808.
Appearance: The body is clear with an orange hue, the head is short and thin, dissipating quickly into a foamy white coating.
Aroma: The aroma is almost exclusively heavily peated scotch. The oak is very strong, coming off a bit astringent, and the peat is heavy. Boy this is peaty. There are some underlying fruit aromas, but they are hard to discern.
Taste: Oh boy this is odd in a way I didnt expect. Theres a sweetness on the intro, sort of fruity with marmalade coming to mind and a caramel sweetness. The mid-taste builds up the sweet malts while peat and oak overlie it, surprisingly not as out of balance as expected. The finish builds again, increasing the strength with an ashtray finish, perhaps some pear underlying it all. Boy this is not for everyone.
Palate: Medium bodied, very crisp, with mild to no carbonation.
Overall: I picked this up on a whim, but I wish I hadnt. This is not for anyone who disliked peat. This is chock full of it. I dont know what I was expecting when I bought this, but I do not enjoy it.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

2581,"2013-03-23",4.0,"Pours amber gold with a minimal white head. Aroma is a mixture of whiskey barrel and something lemony. Theres a faint whiff of molasses - just faint. Flavor is off the charts! Whiskey, oak, smoke, up front then it just mellows into something almost savory. Talk about complex. There is a syrupy sweetness that runs throughout, but it s almost agave or tequila-like.

The aroma picked up a whole lot of smoky peat and earthy whiskey notes accented by funky floral character.. some molasses and honey beneath, but it was fairly well repressed by the peat.. I got slight apple and pear skins on the back of the nose.  The flavor opened with sweeter floral notes and golden raisins, with a hefty wash of peaty Scotch following.. Sherry took over on the middle and through the finish.. slick, woody, boozy finish.  Hot on the palate with low carbonation.. way too much barrel for the underlying brew.. this was a tasty, interesting beverage, but it was hard to get at the ""beer"" part.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

2581,"2012-12-31",4.1,"Bottle # 02229 from Half Time. Pours clear light copper with a white head that left quickly. Aroma is mixed light fruits, sherry and arguably something whisky. Gets smoky as it sits in the glass. Med + body. Starts with fruit and sherry, but smoky whiskey quickly gets in the front. Sort of a dessert of fruit in sherry followed with a whiskey chaser. Thankfully the smoke is not overwhelming. With time the fruit becomes more grape, the sherry sticks around, and the smoke gets smooth.  And there isnt really any heat - even down the gullet. Develops some oaky astringency. Quite nice.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
