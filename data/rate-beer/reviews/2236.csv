2236,"2017-05-07",3.4,"Pours a cloudy orange color with a small bubbly head.

Smell is utmost funky, with a lot of blue cheese and dried mushrooms. Some lemon prevails, adding a pleasant crispness to the otherwise surprisingly musty and heavy nose.

Has a medium, soft carbonation, with a pleasant twist between sugars and the tartness, resulting in a well balanced, refreshing beer. 

Sugars enhance the lemony sourness of the beer, at the same time they prevent a lot of the more subtle layers of flavor to unfold, which are muted due to the more prominent sugar. The carbonation keeps everything in great balance, adding a light mineralic quality to the taste. Finishes more sour than it began, with lots of ripe lemons lingering on the palate.

Definitely prefer the unsweetened version over this one, since it is synergizing on a whole different level, allowing a more intriguing depth to unfold.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2236,"2010-08-21",4.3,"Sampled from the crock, July 2010 at In´t Spinnekopke
This pours from the crock with a dark, caramel color and is topped by a frothy, browned head.  The addition of sugar brings out a rich fruitiness that reminds me of sour fruit varieties; aromas of caramelized kiwis and even a suggestion of strawberries are to be found in the nose.  The aroma is just so complex and appetizing.

The sugar is really well done in the flavor too; it is just so well balanced with the Lambic character.  The caramel mixes quite well with the lactic tartness; this has a big tart / sweet balance to it, both notes are quite big, but they balance so well.  A sharpness is in this beer; a bit of a bite to the finish, is it acetic acid, or perhaps an oak astringency, or maybe it is some phenolics are the interplay between each of them, I am not quite sure, but there is certainly something sharp here that works quite well.  This is exceedingly quaffable; it has texture to it (as the sugar boosts the body a bit), but it is so nicely drinkable on this warm Brussels evening.

This is really the best example of a Faro that I have ever had.  This is a perfect pre and during dinner drink, and I am incredibly impressed with how appetizing and very good this beer ended up being.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2236,"2010-05-20",3.9,"In short: Rich caramel meets Oude Lambik for a surprisingly good beer
How: Hand-pumped at LambikOdroom (3 Fonteinen adjacent pub).  Graciously served free of charge by Armand himself.  
The look: Partially cloudy dark golden body topped by a large off-white head with good retention
In long: Im not familiar with real Faros on tap so I was surprised by the generous head.  I dont know how but the unfermented sugar/caramel/whatever added to make a Faro totally changes the lambic.  Nose is fun, dirty carpet, wet fur, musty.  Taste was also surprising to me.  I expected some kind of sugary unblended lambic.  But the beer has a personality of its own.  I dont know what Armand uses in his Faro but the sweet part of the beer came through as a rich caramel taste.  Very much like the rich caramelized malts flavor from good barley wines.  This did not taste like boring brown sugar at all.  That rich caramel blends with the cider-ish, dry, woody and slightly acidic character of the lambic and creates a totally different experience.  Body is full and the carbonation is very soft.  This is pretty good stuff.  My favourite Faro.  3 Fonteinen brewery accident has got to be the worst catastrophe since Y1K, which I assume was pretty terrible since I cant find any computer records predating year 1000.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Of course that had been my intention all along, but the sourness of Debelder was more poignant in the critique of his forsaken colleagues than the lambic itself. Pumped and poured into the austere Drie Fonteinen tumbler, the Faro resembled unfiltered apple juice, opaque and topped of a light beige column of bubbly foam. Apples appear again with strength in the slightly sweet aroma otherwise dominated by raw vinegar. Soft goat cheese and gorgonzola provide a fresh and smoothing funk. The flavor is again highlighted by apple as well as cantaloupe, apricots and peaches. Lightly sour and barely sweet, this is a velvety soft drink with a character more likely to soothe than any beer Ive had.
