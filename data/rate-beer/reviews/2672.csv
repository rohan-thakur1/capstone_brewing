Nose is thick creamy sweet bourbon syrup with faint roasted oak, nose carries something recognizably signature P√µhjala, molasses, very thick syrupy, vanilla oak with faint touch of roast, nutmeg, almost faint licorice but heavy on the vanilla oak with some bourbon. Taste is interesting, many layers, prunes, figs, rum raisins upfront, warming, bourbon, brandy, rum etc. leading into cherries soaked in alcohol, chocolate syrup, warming in the finish, big vanilla, exotic sugar, cake with brandy and other spirits, deep complex, booze soaked dark fruits, dark cherries, mocha, marzipan, chocolate, multiple spirits, vanilla. Flavours interchange, follow up one and another in complex sequence. Body is syrupy with thin carbonation like Coca-Cola going flat. Very rich, complex decadent,... gorgeous beer. Small plastic ""wax""-like thing going on here which looks stupid and pointless, quite amazing otherwise. By very, very far the best I have had from P√µhjala so far, shockingly beer than most of their beers.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
