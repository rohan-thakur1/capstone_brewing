Ive had two different batches of this so far...one that was 1 day old (11/30 bottling drank Dec 1), and another that they said was probably about a month old, which is what Im rating here. The fresher one was surprisingly not much hoppier than this one, but this older one seems to have more yeasty character, and is closer to real Kellerbier than perhaps anything Ive had in the US so far. Sourdough and sulfur along with a yeasty tang, and while its not bottle conditioned it does contain light sediment and haze. You could tell me this was made in some small Franconian countryside brewery and Id believe it. And thats perhaps what I like the most about it...its so un-American. There are things about it I could like more, and truth be told I dont *quite* find it truly exciting from a purely organoleptic perspective. But I absolutely love the fact that its so much like something youd find on trip through rural Germany...and that is worth an extra point or two for sure.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2816,"2016-11-23",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2016 From bottle its mostly clear gold with a short head. Noble hop aroma is lemon, herbs, mint; malt is dried hay and toasted biscuit; yeast suggests phosphorus, sulfur, calcium. In the mouth its light-bodied with succulent-sweet malt against juicy-oily hops, frothy, crisp, clean, oily, invigorated-salivated finish with sticky bitterness. Superb mouth feel and flavor balance, and excellent hop and malt expression, and the phosphoric yeast brings it all together.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
