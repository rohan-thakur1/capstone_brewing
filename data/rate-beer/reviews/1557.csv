1557,"2015-11-25",4.5,"[ Bottle Pour ][ 8oz ][ Okariba Kyoto ][ $9 ][ Sake Bowl + Glass ][ 11.25.15 ]
>> Pours clear with slight yellowish gold tint. Nose is fresh fruit and herbs, no fusel or sickly fruity esters. Flavor piles on big with what is closer to champagne or cognac warming than sake. Excellent heavy body for sake with a dessert white wine-like, vinous flavor. Super well rounded like good cognac or Sauternes. Its alcoholic and warming, but not hot. Beautiful in every way. Really outstanding. Incredible.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

1557,"2011-03-23",3.7,"720 ml bottle. A gift from my graduating students.
Fresh, clean, fruity aroma, melon, fresh, wet sawdust of cedar. Soft, fruity, spicy flavor, some esters, lots of pepper, noticeable, no, strong, alcohol. Very peppery, prickly, and hot. Some citrus, berries; elegant sweetness.   Light, silky body. Very nice, but I expected heavenly nectar. Alcohol too prevalent.  Somewhat watery as well. Good stuff, but I tend not to go in for this Niigata ""karakuchi"" style.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"

1557,"2010-11-03",3.7,"Bottle at Craigs, Edinburgh tasting, big thanks to Craig for this sake. Shared in company of Craig, Stella, Jan, Charlotte, Fritz and Loz 30.10.10   I hope that I dont get too slayed for a poor review of this Sake, I really have little experience of this type of drink. It looks like water, great clarity, this is possibly a little rougher in the mouth than our previous Sake, but it works fine for me, smooth, not sweet, alcohol just doesnt show, sorry cannot be anymore descriptive than that.

stick at the 3.7 mark the too much alcohol in finish it what stops this being stunning","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","cgarvieuk"
1557,"2009-03-07",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2010 Small carafe for $28 at Tycho in Brentwood (Southern) California. Pours a very viscous, clear body with strong legs. Aroma of pear, candi sugar, vanilla, incredibly clean and refined. Taste is amazingly balanced, I am seriously blown away. Refined, fruity, smooth, long duration, and ZERO alcohol on the taste. Makes Divine Droplets look rough, this stuff is smooth to the nines!. Very complex, over the long duration. Incredibly viscous mouthfeel, heavenly!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1557,"2003-11-27",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2005 Online and NYC price for 750ml bottle: ~$90.  Everything they say about this sake is true!  It is the driest, most complex, misleadingly smooth sake Ive ever consumed in my life.  To be shared with friends (because theyll never quit thanking you for your generosity!), Kubota Manju is a Junmai Daiginjo without equal in my opinion.  But dont take my word for it,  every sake book Ive ever read states that you must try this exceedingly pricey and sublime Daiginjo before you die - its that good.  Now I believe them.  
With a hint of sweetness and no hint whatsoever of its 16% abv, this still, slightly herbal, floral, vanilla sake will blow you away!  Be prepared to shell out big bucks, because at $90/bottle, its just about the priciest sake you can buy short of Daruma sake.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
