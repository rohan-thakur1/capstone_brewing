The appearance has a slightly hazy orange body with a small white head, spotty lacing is left in its wake.
The smell has citrus and hops, slight malts in the background.
The taste is sweet through malts, hops become subdued, slightly bready.
The palate is about a light to medium, some carbonation hits the tongue slightly, sessionable, bitter aftertaste and finish.

1925,"2011-07-16",3.6,"<br clear=""left"">Almost every brewery brews a pale ale - whether its a micro brewpub, a major craft brewery, or one of the macros ""imprint"" lines. Its almost like its a requirement to get a brewers license. The style is usually solid and appeals to people of different taste ranges since its flavorful, but not extremely robust, and drinkable but not watery. Its hard to make a pale ale that really stands out, but Long Trail Pale Ale comes pretty close. APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured a 12oz bottle into an English pint glass. This beer forms a huge head of rocky, off-white foam that leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The color is a hazy shade of orange to copper and is extremely bubbly. The aroma is surprisingly citrusy, with some noticeable floral notes as well. It could easily be mistaken for an IPA from the scent alone.TASTEI should ""disclaim"" this review by mentioning I was drinking a beer that was bottled six months before I drank it. I was worried the beer mightve gone bad but was genuinely surprised by how flavorful it was. Usually, American pale ales just satisfy me, but Long Trail Pale Ale went a little above and beyond and actually impressed me. Much like the aroma, the first swig had the hop bite of an IPA. Its a clean, citrusy hop with a candy-like sweetness in the finish. The bitterness lingers for only a moment or two, leaving your palate clean in the end.Perhaps it was due to the fact I was drinking old beer, but I definitely noticed the flavor mellowed out about halfway through. The palate didnt change, as the clean hop taste shone through, but the intensity seemed to be muted. The bitterness increased and became a bit drier. Still, this is more than I can say for many beers of the style so it was still pleasing.DRINKABILITYLong Trail Pale Ale is not too thick and definitely not too thin in terms of mouthfeel. The body is perfectly medium bordering on the light side. It goes down smooth and finishes clean.Believe it or not, I couldnt find the ABV statistic for this beer anywhere. Id estimate its around 5.5% since its too robust to be much lighter, but doesnt have the density of something heavier like an IPA. It would make a great session beer, especially for hopheads, and pair well with dinner.FINAL THOUGHTSLong Trail is one of those mid-level craft breweries known for making pedestrian beers of pedestrian styles and technically you could say that true for their Pale Ale. However, Im impressed the brewery was able to add an extra touch to this brew and make it a little more memorable.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

While sometimes hops and malts can be harmonious, in this case they kind of just cancel each other out.

1925,"2011-04-04",3.0,"12oz. Im not sure where the English Pale Ale designation is coming from. This has a serious hop bite to it.

1925,"2010-10-30",3.0,"I expect an IPA to be a little hopper than this. Something slightly off in the finish, its slightly metallic and oily. Aside from these minor flaws, its sprightly and refreshing, with bright citrusy hop notes. Not mind blowing, but nothing from Long Trail is.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","scarletfire65"
1925,"2010-10-18",3.5,"On tap at Maggies on the River, in Watertown, NY. Served a nice golden color with a nice head with good retention and lacing. Has a mild malt and grainy citrus aroma. Not overpowering, inviting. Has a citrus & malt flavor with nice crisp bitterness to round things out. Quite refreshing.
medium body, crisp & clean. A well balanced brew. Hits the spot. Very smooth and easy drinker. Had a couple with lunch only wish I had time for a few more.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
1925,"2010-09-29",3.1,"On tap at the Red Parrot in Newport.  It started off promising with a fluffy off white head capping the golden ale.  It went down hill from there.  The pale ale is kinda piney, but not the good over the top uber hoppy piny and resiny flavor of a DIPA.  But rather a fail hearted tease that just pisses you off and almost skunks the beer...","Florida, USA","50belair"

1925,"2010-08-01",3.2,"Bottle.  Pours a clear golden color with a white head.  Nose is light piney hops, a hint of citrus, and light malts.  A bit watery, citrus hops come out more than in the nose, still some pine supporting.  A decent balance between the hops and the malt - I just wish there was more.","Massachusetts, USA","jarow"

This is a really fresh, grassy and piney beer with slight red apple notes. The beer has a blended palate that is quenching and biting at the same time.
