837,"2013-03-08",3.8,"Draft at Capone?s. Pours a hazy yellow with a slight white head. Aroma is strong grapefruit with lots of dankness. Taste is very interesting. Dank hops mix with grapefruit characters to give a really strong, deep flavor. Crushingly dry which I attribute to the lager yeast. Really weird but really good.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","DeputyAndy"

837,"2012-12-12",3.5,"On tap at the Cask Republic. Aroma glistens with hop oils, fresh and if I had to guess in the Nelson Sauvin or Galaxy. It had that pungent white wine and pale citrus quality. The extra-strong hop nose lessens a bit in the flavor realm, but holds on to a nicely terse and biting grassiness. The bummer here is that anything ""lager"" is obliviated by the intense dry-hopping, which puts this beer out of balance a little.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
