1849,"2012-05-04",3.7,"Pizzeria Paradiso, Alexandria cask ($6): Brownish gold body with a lot of head for a cash beer. Aroma is bread, booze, and a bit of hops. Taste is interesting, because it is one of the few heller bocks that have a booze taste and still taste pretty good. I think it was more apparent by the cask pour of this. Bread is the main flavour. Drinkability is absurdly high, but this too might have something to do with the cask. Pretty damn good.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
1849,"2011-08-04",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub last weekend.

Pours a clear golden color with some visible carbonation and a white head thats a finger or two high. Good spotty lacing on the way down. The nose is very bready and doesnt have too much complexity, though its fairly nice. The flavor ramps up a bit with some nice bready undertones along with a bit of crust and a chewy character. Very light hop presence and a bit of light alcohol in the finish, though it doesnt display the 7% thats listed. Another very good representation of the style.

1849,"2011-05-21",4.1,"A beautiful clover honey gold, with a nicy white foamy head. The aroma began with grassy, floral hints. Taste - lots of sweet biscuit and bread malts. Medium to full bodied.  Ridiculously easy to drink. A very nice beer.","USA","weharvie"
1849,"2011-04-25",3.5,"Growler, from the brewpub, enjoyed less than a hour later. The beer pours a beautiful clover honey gold, topped with a persistent white foamy head. The nose was initially grassy, floral and with a slight touch of green apple, pear drops and a little booziness. Tastewise, lots of sweet biscuit and bread malts, with nice subtle bitterness that lingers on into the finish. Medium to full bodied, ridiculously easy to drink, though the booze catches up with you later. A very nice beer.","Gordonsville, Virginia, USA","Velkyal"

1849,"2009-04-26",3.8,"So maniac and phukktifano and I go to this brewery SIX DAYS AGO. We expect nothing new will be here, but we call ahead. TWO NEW BEERS! This place has been open just over 5 months and they have over twenty beers. Thats just insane. Pours a hazy peach color with a large head. Fair head retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel, toffee and stone fruits. Taste is toffee, caramel, cotton candy, spice, pineapple, melon, apple and light alcohol. Full bodied. Quite nice.,","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
