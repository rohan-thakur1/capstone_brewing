3202,"2015-11-18",3.1,"Pours out a pretty pale yellow gold color with a small white head. Aroma is of grass, dough, cereal, light hop bitterness, sticky malt. Taste is much the same, lots of that sticky cereal malt taste of macros, then in creeps some bitterness to give it something. Not something Id go crazy over, but its the style.","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"
3202,"2015-11-18",3.5,"Pale straw gold with a touch of mist to it. Herbal dry hopped aroma leaks out fast, tailed with toasted grains, dry honeycomb, and fresh white bread. Lager yeast and floral, herbal bitterness, straightforward and easy. Peppery, brisk, lean flavor with preserved lemons, notebook paper, citrus piths, white bread sugar. Bothersome, insipid sweetness despite the persistent hop pushback. Brittle and papery consistency but theres enough juiciness and herbal tang to keep it bright.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

3202,"2015-11-11",2.1,"Did I really just spend money on this? Smuttynose is going to get a boost in sales from this, but carton is going to be the ones really hurt. Horribly old tasting all around. Hops and malt. Maybe they put natural ice in the can by mistake. Upon another sip. Nope. I would rather a natural ice right now. Sorry guys. You both just messed up making this","New Jersey, USA","njdrinker"

3202,"2015-10-30",2.8,"Tallboy can from Xroads. WTF???? Basically Ijust spent the same $ that I would spend on a craft 16oz 4pack for something that could pass as PBR. Poured a watery straw body under an ample foamy bright white head. Aroma/flavor of lightly sweet grains, dough, green grapes, paste. Body is slightly fuller than a macro with average carbonation. This beer sucks, rather have a 4pack of PBR for 1/3 the price.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
