1385,"2010-07-12",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazy, dark ruby-brown with a modest, egg-shell head. Sweet, lightly roasted malt aroma with nuts and caramel. Flavor too is sweet, with notes of chocolate, roasted malts, hints of rich bread, more caramel and faint, earthy hops to finish. Light to medium in body with average, fizzy carbonation. Finishes lightly sweet and roasty. Very good.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

1385,"2009-12-14",3.5,"pours dark with off-white head. Smells a little bready, toffee and nuts. Medium body and quite smooth. Toffee and caramel with some bitterness on the finish. Very nice going down, quaffable and pairs well with food.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"
1385,"2008-06-24",3.5,"Pours a nice dark brown into the glass with an off white head.  Aroma is a combination of sweet malt and lager skunk.  Beautiful taste combination of bitterness and sweetness.  It is most likely dangerous how easy I can knock back this beer.","Houston, Texas, USA","graham515"
1385,"2007-09-07",3.6,"This pours out dark with a foamy beige head.  The label has a nice banner and images of Mittel Europen towns.  The aroma is of malt, yeast, and honey.  It is a little watery, but has a pleasant taste of roasted grains, malt, and just the right touch of hops.  The aftertaste is very nice.  I cant think of a better beer of this kind, but I havent tried a lot of dunkels.","USA","Slipstream"
1385,"2007-07-15",3.4,"POWERS YOU ARE FROM A DIFFERENT ERA! THIS IS A GOOD BEER, NICE COLOR GOOD FLAVORS BUT A BIT WATERY WITH A ASTRINGENT BITTERNESS THAT LACKS CHARACTER IN MYBOOK. THE NUTTY TASTE IS A SAVING GRACE ALONG WITH THE INTERESTING MALT BACKING. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE AL/CONTENT. CLEAN BURP ANYWAY! NICE CARBONATIONS SOLID AND TINY! NICELY SWEET!","New Jersey, USA","BREWMUSKCLES"
1385,"2007-03-29",3.7,"Ruby red color, stout like roasted malt aroma. Solid carbonination, bready. Roasted malty almond like taste subtle hopiness","California, USA","doublebock"
1385,"2006-05-31",3.3,"A nice import dark reddish lager from Czech republic that was supposedly crafted for the US market. Smooth and medium bodied with a mild taste (slightly sweet).","","User37895"
1385,"2006-04-19",3.6,"12 oz bottle.  Deep dark brown, thick tan head.  Aroma is very nutty and toasty with cocoaish notes as well.  Maltiness is very deep and rich.  falvour is also sweet and malty, toffee/cocoa, toast.  Complex sweetness.  Hops have faded significantly from what I can tell were once here.  A little bit soapy.  Also notes of a bit of vanilla.  Full, sweet mouthfeel and some light, lingering earthiness.  Pretty tasty, although not as fresh as it probably could/should be.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1385,"2005-10-21",4.3,"Pours mahogany coloured with a thin foamy head. Beautiful caramel and roasted malt aroma with a nice touch of floral hops. Great taste of lightly roasted malt with some initial sweetness. Theres lots of hop bitterness but it seems so much more refined  and balances compared to the high test IBUs.","Mississauga, Ontario, CANADA","iam"
1385,"2005-05-09",4.4,"Ruby-brown, medium carbonation with classic crown on top. Superb appearance. I know those hops in my nose; they quiet bitter but not in big crude way. They gentle but not shy in any aspect .Mild sweet malt behind. Very refreshing. Prefect balanced taste. Smooth medium bodied enough brown malt with hints of roast. Sweet chewy malt and gentle reminder of hops. Solid mastercraft. This beer proves that it does not need to be huge and bold with 100 IBUs to be great.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
1385,"2005-03-17",3.3,"This bottled brew poured a small foamy head of fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly lasting.  It left behind an uncarbonated transparent dark ruby red brown colored body and a poor lacing.  The aroma contained notes of mild malts and brown malts.  The mouth feel was initially smooth with a mild tingle in the finish.  The flavor was bock like with a malty bite.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1385,"2005-01-27",3.8,"Pours a dark reddish brown with practically no head.  The aroma had vanilla, caramel and malts, plus a bit of Pilsner Urquel.  I also picked that up in the taste.  The taste was solid with malt, vanilla, caramel and plum.   The mouthfeel was very good.  That was my favorite part of it.  I got this in the beer of the month club shipment and it was a nice surprise.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"

1385,"2004-05-13",3.0,"Tastes more like a schwarzbier than a dunkel, but who am I, right? Pours a very deep dark red, with a very small head. Taste is a chalky malt with a bit of chocolate. Finish is  average and a bit on the sweet side.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1385,"2004-01-06",3.5,"Dark reddish brown with a light head.  A sweet roasted malt aroma, not as sweet as a bock, as the hop profile is more noticable.  Very drinkable.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

1385,"2002-07-25",4.7,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2003 So after I rated this beer for the first time back in July, 2002, the Kisz distributor contacted me to say he was so pleased I like the beer.  I told him the beer was amazing, but the label needed major work.  He proceeded to tell me he'd made the label himself and spent weeks on it.  Oops.  Back to the beer, it's safe to say I can hardly think of anything I'd rather drink than this beer.  It's even better than Xingu.  A knockout aroma and sweet maltiness that's worldclass.  Magnifique!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
1385,"2002-06-14",4.1,"Very impressed.  Would certainly drink another. Quite a surprise.","Clemmons, North Carolina, USA","biergirl"
