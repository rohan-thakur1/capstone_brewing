1267,"2017-02-28",4.0,"Slightly veiled dark amber color with moderate activity. Soft creamy beige 2 finger head, lasting around 5-10 minutes, with dense lacing but faint legs. Flavors of caramel, nutmeg, ginger, roasted grains, lemon, yeast, herbal spices. Bread and toffee sugary feel, with sharp zesty fruity that balance things out. Slick milky medium body with crispy and prickly carbonation. Medium strength finish, quite long, deeply malty and roasted, pleasant burnt caramel, with lingering leafy and citrusy hops. Interesting creamy density (a trademark for La vache folle?), still nicely fresh, with some sharp yeast. Quite tasty and filling, but uplifting like a Belgian. Overall very good quality craft. A robust ESB, heavily spiced and probably too much, not as delicate and pleasant compared to the Fullers.","Quebec, CANADA","Bierdimpfe"

Charlevoix are a solid brewery who produce consistently excellent beers. And as the style goes, this is a pretty good ESB. The problem is, even a pretty good ESB is fairly pedestrian fare. A little variation on the theme would have been welcome - maybe a little dry hopping to produce a more floral nose, for example? Dont get me wrong, I could easily session this, and Id like to try it on tap - but its not as much fun as the rest of their brews are. (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Tastes sweet, a bit of caramel, floral hops, grainy, and then comes the yeast attack that overwhelms everything else. This is a yeast funk bomb of an ESB.

1267,"2007-01-20",3.3,"500 mL bottle from Montreal (Joanette).
App.:  golden-orange, hazy (oh yeah??) and a large light tan head. 
 
Aroma: light fruitiness, orange and citrus, yeasty, an acidity that isnt vinegar...more like malic (apples) and a sort of dank earthiness that I have trouble characterizing.  When warmed a bit, light grapefruit hops comes through.  

Palate:  med-full body, carbonation that starts soft and subtle but suddenly turns aggressive and sharp.  

Flav.:  immediately yeasty, very yeasty (hence the haze, I guess).  Moderate sweetness.  A bit of the orange citrus and fruitiness beyond that.  Decent bready-malty, toffee finish.  Again presents some citrus hops when warmed a bit.  Not too bitter.

Aroma is hoppy, with citrusy character and notes of dark tea, anise, grapes, grapefruit, pine spruce and other herbs very difficult to decipher. Some floral hints too. Really complex and beautiful smell.
Flavor is also very hoppy, very bitter for an ESB. Strong bitter lemon touches with  a supercharged Royal Ceylon tea touch. It feels great.
Texture is a little light, like heavy water. Medium bodied and with the alcohol well hidden. Nice astringent finish. Good and long aftertaste. Low carbonation.
A delightful ESB.

Aroma has notes of dry wood, lightly spicy hops, light Belgian yeast notes and hints of caramel, raspberries and orange marmalade.   I personally thought it started with a Belgian-like yeast flavor, much like a Belgian Ambrée ale, but then some spicy hops, English in nature enter the mix, while a lightly dry toffee and caramel mix with hints of toasted grains.  Flavor is full and the malt extraction is well-done here.  It is hard to ask for a much more pleasing mouthfeel.  Lightly creamy, low, natural carbonation and a medium to medium-full body without comprimising drinkability.  Bitterness comes in the middle and lingers lightly on the end, just enough there to add complexity, without going overboard/out-of-style.  As it warms, the flavor thins out somewhat on the end, and there is a little bit too much dry breadiness on the end, but its hardly a significant fault.

The head settles as a lofty 2in frothy beige foam and the body beneath is an orangey-copper. The nose is somewhat spiced and tinny with strong undertones of roast malts.

1267,"2004-04-17",4.1,"Hazy amber beer with huge floaties. Once you get past the floaties, a wonderful aroma comes out, with a fruit salad containing kiwi, green grapes and citrus, with very floral hops. Wonderful hops dance in your mouth with that fruity feeling. Rather complex considering the stimuli I experienced. The citrus caracter become more and more present as the beer wamed up.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1267,"2004-04-12",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2011 Murky amber appearance with quite a few sediments, but not nearly as many as others it seems. Smallish light honey head. It displays a rather original nose for a bitter, almost belgian yeasty flavors (oranges, pears) accompanying the butterscotch malt profile and the subdued hops (citrus, lemon). Palate is fruity, lightly tart and proposing a dry and bitter finish. Not a traditional bitter thats for sure and possibly my favorite of the very few Ive had, but this still doesnt come close to rocking my boat, for the same refreshing and quaffable qualities, Id much rather have victorys prima pils from a few hours ago. I loved the coating round mouthfeel though. Nevertheless, this beer has given me the feeling that Charlevoixs domain remains belgian styles (although Im longing for their doppelbock) and thats for the best from my egoistical point of view!  Second batch which was delivered in Montreals neighborhood around late september 2004 impressed me more. Very quaffable with less expressive yeast character. Less citric and just more defined malt profile. I really dug this one. 7/4/8/4/15 = 3.8 ////  I had not had this beer in a couple of years. Now in 2004, Im still comfortable with my previous score, finding the pie crust maltiness fun, the appearance flawless and the citrusy hops lending a bit too far on the soapy side of things to be captivating. It remains a pleasurable drink with a fun yeast character, but perhaps a bit agressive with its tight small bubbles.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1267,"2004-04-12",3.5,"Very cloudy caramel body with plenty of yeast. Thin but quite dense head. Its spicy (ginger) and fruity (citrus) aroma could have more punch, but the taste (same thing as the aroma) is wonderful and strong. The alcohol is well hidden and the final is balanced. Interesting...","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
1267,"2004-04-11",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2014 Nearly endless head over chestnuts and delicate caramel... Sweet flowers over peppery, earthy and resinous hop bitterness... A slender and balanced Premium Bitter and a highly competent go-getter...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1267,"2004-04-09",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2004 Dense body due to bottled-conditionned process??? Nice orange-amber color. Very citrus like flavor (grapefruit actually). Low carbonation and good bitterness. Small presence of malt. Alcohol makes a warm feeling but does not cut the bitterness. A good example of ESB.","Quebec, CANADA","PrimeMinister"
