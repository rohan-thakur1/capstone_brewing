932,"2015-08-09",3.7,"Bottle at home in London - picked up from an Oddbins (London Bridge, perhaps?). Pours mostly clear amber-gold with a large, frothy off-white head that settles into a cream. The aroma holds toasted grains, caramel and lightly tangy citrus fruits. Light-medium sweet flavor with lightly toasted, bready malts, some caramel, a bit of orange, soft pine, berries. Low bitterness. Light bodied with average to lively, massaging carbonation. Pretty smooth on the finish, with more prominent bready malt character, light piney spice, citrus, peach, orange, creamy caramel. The more I drink of this beer the more I like it. Fun stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

932,"2015-06-04",3.5,"Beautiful deep ruby colour with an orange tan head. Aroma is subtle with soft hints of lightly spiced bread and a faint sense of tart refreshing zest as though from a melony ocean breeze. Texture is thick and smooth with very lightly toasted biscuity flavours followed by caramel and a twinge of hedgerow fruit like blackberries which have been somehow granulated and dissolved in at very low quantities. An unusual one, surprisingly light, increasingly fruity as you drink. Good.","Bristol, Somerset, ENGLAND","leebotton"
