999,"2013-07-21",4.2,"Appearance:
Cloudy orange under an off-white creamy head which lingers long like a velveteen blanket. Swirls with extremely sticky lace which lingers from first quaff to last. Lovely lacing.

Nose:
Sour/tart tropical fruits. Apricots, cantaloupe, starfruit, and guava. Really sour sourdough bread. Grains of paradise and caraway. Prickly pear and agave. Splintered bark and golden leather soft to the touch. Grapefruit and lemon rind in the back and along the edge. Candied ginger.

Palate:
Zing! Zow! Grabs my tastebuds and doesnt let gonot that I want it to. Sour tart not-quite-ripe tropical fruits such as starfruit, papaya, guava, and a touch of agave. Candied ginger and spice in the breath. Loaves of freshly baked sourdough. Far more herbs than the nose implied: juniper, flower stems, grains of paradise, and caraway. Citrus rind and rustic oaky finish.

Final Thoughts:
Fabulous doesnt come close to describing this offering from Cigar City Brewing. While on draft, I quaffed many pints before it was unfortunately retired from their brewing cycle. But maybe just maybe, Cigar City will bring this beer back if I say please with a cherry on top. Please.

Finish is tart, sourish, and bitter. Smooth, juicy, and prickly. Like a Belgian Pale Ale with a lot of fresh-squeezed fruit. Love it.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"

999,"2012-07-28",4.1,"7/28/12. On tap at Kickbacks. Slightly hazy amber pour, almost orange, with a nice khaki head that sticks around forever and laces in nice foamy rings. Spicy yeast in the aroma with plenty of phenolics, nice floral aspects, malt, and a hint of tartness. Nice flavor with lots of phenolic bitterness, spicy yeast, floral aspects, pale malts, tropical fruits, a hint of tartness, and lingering orange and lemon. Nice!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
999,"2012-07-02",3.9,"On tap at Coffee District - as the original reviewer explained, this beer defies categorization

A: Cloudy orange with a frothy head. Good retention and sticky foam

S: Wow, super fruity nose (apple juice, grapefruit, guava)...This tastes ALOT like Guava Grove batch one. Never had a beer hopped with these hops, but it lends a juicy ripe fruit aroma. Complex and balanced

T: Guava, apples, white grapes, and almost a Chardonnay characteristic. Very similar to Guava Grove somehow.

MF/O: Smooth carbonation, tangy tart guava finish. Delicious beer, glad to try another winner from CCB","Parkland, Florida, Florida, USA","scottyshades"
999,"2012-06-12",3.4,"On tap at Churchkey.  Served in a mini snifter.  Pours clear golden with a nice, foamy white head.  A bit of lacing and a thin cap.  The nose has some nice peppery phenolics along with some light earthy hops.  A bit of pilsner base comes underneath.  Flavor hits the same notes with the yeast being most prominent.  Good spicy, earthy character.  Light-medium body with smooth bitterness.  Pretty good.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

999,"2012-06-06",3.6,"On draft @ the independent Seminole Heights.  Great overall aroma and appearance.  Smells of white grape and citrus.  Thin cream color head that had great retention.  Light copper/ hazy orange color.  Taste of white grape citrus fruit,  slightly bitter.  Nelson Sauvin hops really get a chance to shine in conjunction with the bier de garde yeast.   Overall good easy drinking beer.

999,"2012-05-05",3.7,"Draft Mostly clear orange ale with a huge, frothy, white head. Great retention. The nose is a spicy, fruity, earthy mélange of citrusy, peppery and floral hops; biscuit and bready malts; fuzzy-fruity, spicy, brothy esters and phenols. Medium to full-bodied with a mildly creamy mouthfeel and vibrant carbonation. The flavor serves up a lot of nice, earthy, peppery, tropical bitterness intertwined with spicy, bready, Belgian yeast inspired notes. Finishes moderately bitter, lightly abrasive and then dries out a good bit. Interesting. Totally worth trying.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

999,"2012-04-19",3.8,"What a beer to sip upon! The body was a great hazy orange with very light bubbles. Lots of grapefruit, orange peel and hops are in the nose - altogether pretty floral. The first sip gives off an intense hop fruitiness, but that mellows out with a solid sweet-malt twang. Finishes clean and dry - VERY drinkable all damn day.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
