1858,"2016-06-22",4.2,"Hab ich 2015 im TAP HOUSE MUNICH geschlürft. 0,1l vom Fass für ca.4-5 Euro glaube ich. Daher ist die Bewertung auch aus meiner Erinnerung und ich werde nur tätig, weil mich das Bier so beeindruckt hat. Viel Malz, Süße, Marzipan und irgendwie weihnachtliche Würzaromen habe ich in meinem Kopf wenn ich an dieses Bier denke und es war extrem rund. Lecker.","Kiel, GERMANY","ALIBALI"
1858,"2016-05-28",2.9,"May 15. On tap at the brewpub. It poured hazy golden body with medium sized head. Fruity sweet grape and cognac in fine aroma. Sweet. Flavor was more sour though, cooked fruit, wood, vinegar. Medium bodied, but even then, alcohol was quite well hidden and it really seemed like a macerated muscat wine brewed with wild yeasts, since also it had some lambic-like notes. Very interesting experiment, however admittedly, I was not amazed.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

1858,"2016-03-14",3.8,"Im holzfass gereifte biere at Tap House Munich. Clear deep copper color with a small white head leaving a thick (or as the Germans would say, ""dick"") ring. Thats the image you should have in your mind: DICK RING. Funky tart-bal aroma, hints of Brett, maybe some lacto our something. Honey, oak, Muscat. The flavor has loads of cat. Just a touch of sweetness, a touch of tartness. Just screams ""-BALS!"" like a Tourettes sufferer. Medium-bodied, light carbonation. Good. Different.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
1858,"2016-01-21",2.8,"Bottle. Tart and vinous aroma with notes of vinegar and wood. The base for something out of the ordinary is there, sadly the flavour - while being likewse tart and vinous - is rather flat and dull in comparison with the aroma.","Mikołów, POLAND","ElDesmadre"
