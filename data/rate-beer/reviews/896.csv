896,"2015-09-17",2.9,"Glass at Seiyo, 9/14/15.Creamy-beige with just a hint of haze and plentiful carbonation rising creating a cluster of bubbles that I wouldnt quite call a head.Not much in the nose, though some sugars, light almondmeal, rice crackers and sweet vanilla cream. No alcohol.Flavor is incredibly sweet. Yikes, was not expecting that. Its got some acidity on the end, and the carbonation helps mitigate the sweetness somewhat, but as soon as this thing starts warming and the carbonation dying down a touch (ie. unless you really chug the stuff), it really starts getting too sluggishly sweet. The flavors are enjoyable though, with some earthiness, warm, salted white rice porridge and hints of lemon and coconut.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

896,"2008-10-24",3.9,"6% abv on  my bottle too.  MY bottle was $15.25 from Chicago.  Pours hazy at first via strong carbonation then settles down into a softly carbonated slightly hazy clear with a medium sized foamy head.  I think this is the first sake I have had that actually formed a head at all and lasted for any length of time.  It even has a decent lacing!  The aroma is mild with a soft polished rice note.  The mouth feel is crisp tingle and sweet.  Nice sweet polished rice crisp flavor.    Quite quaffable and unlike any sake I’ve ever had in my 20 different sakes.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
896,"2008-02-10",3.8,"Let me be the first to say that I was skeptical when I first saw this, but it is a winner in my book! By the way, the back if my bottle read 6% abv. Aroma is fruity and smells of somewhat cheap (poor quality) sake. Appearance is a hazy off-white, nearly lemonade. No head despite the carbonation. Taste is amazing. Milky, sweet, fruity, gorgeous sake. Body is light, mouthfeel is a creamy-syrupy mix and there is a bit of lively carbonation. Soo expensive ($11.99 for a 180ml bottle), but so yummy!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
896,"2007-08-06",4.6,"Creamy stuff!  Sparkling.  Tastes like a glass of Sprite.  Really delicious.  Its about 1/2 nigori, and 100% sweet.  Real easy drinkin!  Go buy this stuff - its a winner.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
896,"2007-06-14",3.8,"This was my first Sake. Shared it was shared with a fellow ratebeerian, and courtesy of a local liquor store owner. I really liked this alot. It went great with the sushi we had. Poured a cloudy light golden white color. Very sweet smell. Kind of bubbly like a champaigne. Very sweet. Hints of grapefruit and orange. I think it was retailing for about 9 bucks in California. Small bottle, but sure worth it!","Pickerington, Ohio, USA","BeerVirgin72"
896,"2006-11-09",3.6,"180mL Bottle: Pours a milky pale white color, small white head and little lacing. Nose of light banana and koji, sweet fermenting rice notes. The flavor is zesty and citrusy with a orange/buckwheat and peppermint note along with a touch of alcohol. Very nice, creamy, right amount of carbonation and a bit of graininess and doughy in the background. Excellent, but 180mL of 8% aclohol junmai for $13? Sheesh.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
