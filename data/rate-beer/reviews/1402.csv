Tastes of dried wood bark, old pepper peel and smoky toffee, accompanied by a present milk tartness. This leads to more wood, as well as more sweetness, underlined by a pleasant acidity, resulting in a sweet and sour finish, featuring glazed caramel and a present tartness. 

Easy drinking Dunkel with a surprising sour twist, acting as an antagonist to the malts, creating an interesting interplay, as the maltiness wouldnt build up too much depth by itself.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1402,"2011-07-31",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2014 My Bottom Line :  
Toasted pumpernickel bread with light roasted and smoked angles is further diversified by raisin-like fruitiness for a quaffable, pillowy Dunkel. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam tops the clear dark brown. 
-Like their wonderful Helles, this brew would be even more beautiful if the carbonation were tuned down a bit (which it is in the bottle!). 
-The mouthfeel is lean and drinkability is high. Residual sugars levels are quite low. 
-This goes along great with smoked pork.
-The flavor profile on this one is textbook Dunkel. Like their Helles, which doesnt aim at being different, this one excels in delivering exactly what you expect, all in a most comfortable setting.
-This is as good as Gradls own superb Dunkel, but perhaps more rustic (not as polished).

1402,"2007-09-19",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2009 Bottle. Dark brown color. Malty peacharoma with a hint of cinnamon. Malty sweet flavor with pineapple, toffee and hints of licorice and cinnamon. Typical Franconian dunkles. tasty, easy to drink, very fruity but also a clean, albeit somewhat sticky mouthfeel.
Tasted again in june 2008. I still stand by my earlier rating. Also noticed some flowery hops in the background.
Ans tasted again in 2009. 5 half litre glasses! This beer grows on you.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
1402,"2007-03-01",3.6,"bottled. deep shade of purple brown and a persistent off-white head. dry and roasty aroma with suggestions of prunes and switched-off toaster. rye flavour, dog biscuits, mellow, quite subtle for a dunkel but all the flavour is good","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
1402,"2007-02-01",3.6,"Bottled, label said 5.3%. Strong aroma of dark chocolate, sweet toffee. Certainly not a regular Dunkel aroma. Very dark brown, beige head, good lace. Sweet, nice bitterness, chocolate, toffee, dark malts, more bitter in the finish. Medium body, light dry finish. Complex for a Dunkel, yet highly drinkable.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
1402,"2006-07-19",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2012 My bottles label is different, but its the same beer.  Very sweet aroma of sticky malt, with caramel, rocky candy, and some Bazooka Joe.  Slight underlying herbal hoppiness.  Extremely dark brown with ruby highlights and a lacing, creamy light brown head.  Sharp, crisp taste melts into creaminess.  Caramel, toffee, roast/toast, hoppy, bittersweet.  Medium-thin body.  Good and slightly unusual. [3.2][19 July 2006] Bottle MHD 30.10.12.  Nose of strong roast malt with some coffee grounds and light sourness, some wood, some burned char.  Pours a foreboding mahogany with a short head.  Malty taste is all about different layers of burned wood, charcoal, ash, just fascinating in its depth, but with a dry and dusty noble hop element that manages to hold its own.  Light cereal grain under the roast and toffee, dense hay with a little farmyard, and here and there miniscule veins of sugar for your tongue-miner to strike.  Medium body, fizzy carbonation and a little warming at the rate Im drinking it, but hey, who could blame me?  Tremendous. [3.8][17 July 2012 - almost the anniversary!]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1402,"2006-07-01",2.8,"An amber beer with a huge light brown head. The aroma is sweet with a light touch of both caramel, and wheat? The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel, leading to a very dry and slightly roasted end.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

1402,"2006-02-14",3.4,"Bottle (from Landbierparadies): slightly hazy, amber coloured, thin off-white foamy, stable layer; malty, a bit grainy nose with a tinge of milk-coffee and hops; quite dry malty flavour with traces of milk-chocolate; short, mild finish, gentle hop-bitterness, again traces of milk-chocolate.

1402,"2005-03-20",3.7,"Caramelly, toasted grain nose with some dusty burlap smells. Dark clear brown with a tall fluffy head. Big sweet toasted malt front unviels a substantial chocolate taste that turns to a dry woodiness. Ends with a weak coffee bitterness. Very smooth and sophisticated. Flavorful and lots of character. Alcohol - though low - warms the throat a little as it goes down.","GERMANY","pivo"
