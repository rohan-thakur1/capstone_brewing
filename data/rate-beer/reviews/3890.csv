Glad to try this again - originally had this a few times at Cigar City, Hday and the Florida Berliner Bashes, but my ratings were always taken down. This batch is a bit different and important to note that the original batches were 5.0/5.0. Pours a super bright pink with white lace. Pretty crazy coloring. Nose is passion fruit all the way. Mouthfeel is dry, tart and sour with notes of passion fruit, sour lemons, cereal and grains. Where the finish was absolute juice in the first few batches, this time around theres much more grain/cereal character present which is a bit grating on the palate. Still a fine beer though, and a great berliner. Bring that juice. RERATE::: Again at GABF 2016. It seems the draft/kegged version of this beer is materially better than the bottle. Most notably, I dont get as much cereal grains in the finish as I remember tasting from the bottle - much juicier as well.  One of my favorite berliners and  passion fruit beers, period.

3890,"2015-10-20",4.4,"Draft on tap at the OG Party (Miami, FL). Though Ive had this on tap at previous events under Cigar Citys name. Finally able to rate it. Pours a deep alluring purple reddish hue, pinkish dragonfruit glow with decent hazines, frothy pinkish head atop is solid, sits around and laces well enough. Frothy and inviting. Aromas are tropical, passionfruit and dragonfruit meet starfruit, guava, kiwi and tropical melange. Dry and twangy lactic appeal, earth and nice fruity edge. Delicious. Initial bursts of fruit, dragon fruit and jabs of fruit punch, tart lacto, citrus and passionfruit melange, cool and subtle sweetness as we press on. Fruity and prominent, the same distinct play between aggressive dragonfruit that overwhelms the passionfruit a bit (but that prevails in the end). Sweet, sour, and punchy. A light enough body to drink far more than anyone should need to. Punchy and aggressive dragonfruit, some guava, that passionfruit preaches more into the backend and finush. A wonderous pour as usual, fruity punchy nose and delicious flavors and flow make this a winner. An amazing beer. Perhaps the bottles differ but at the source (Last keg of 2015), nothing beats this bad boy.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3890,"2015-09-27",4.4,"On draft at JWB during the Florida Weiss bash. Pours a mostly clear and bring pinkish purple color and topped by a thin film of pink foam that quickly fades and leaves little to no lace behind. Looks beautiful. The aroma is incredible showing huge notes of sweet passion fruit and tart, funky dragon fruit to go with some light citrus acidity and the sour mash base. The fresh fruit really dominates and smells amazing. The flavor is quite tart and aciditic from the fruit with the tart dragon fruit and sweet passion fruit melding together beautifully and bringing so much fruit flavor to the beer. It leans more to the tart side especially with sour base beer, but there is just enough fruit sweetness to balance things out. Amazing all the fruit flavor that they were able to get in this thing. Light to medium in body with ample carbonation that lends to the tartness and leads to a lengthy fruity finish with a touch of acidity as well. Thirst quenching and delicious as each sip begs for another. Just an amazing fruited Berliner Weiss that is straight forward and perfectly executed and just as good as the other times Ive had it. Really great beer.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3890,"2015-09-24",5.0,"From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis house. This 750 mL beauty was offered up by Mike. Holy damn. It pours a bright vibrant purple/pink with a thin collar of purple-ish head that vanishes quickly leaving no lace. The aroma is something else. It smells like Hawaiian Punch at the first sniff, and it only gets better from there. There is a nice sour tartness that works with the fruit punch. I love dragon fruit and passion fruit, and they work so well in this baby. The flavors are like that Hawaiian Punch, only a lot better. Its not as syrupy, just light and crisp. The fruits are beautiful. Its not complex, but delivers exactly what its supposed to. This is an amazing Berliner. The mouth feel is also light and crisp with a slight tart sour on the finish. The carbonation is light and bubbly, but carries it just far enough. The aftertaste is lingeringly fruit punch based with a lovely sourness.

Re-rate of DFPF bottle after opening possibly infected bottle. Bottle wax was red and no signs of any problems. No holes, no leakage, looks perfect. Beer pours an inviting red color, not much head. Aroma has hints of fruitiness, tart, not vegetal, but has some interesting fruity aromas. Taste is dry, fruity, tart, get some of the passion fruit. This is leaps and bounds better than the bottle homer shared. Still get some weird aromas, but the taste is nice. The fruitiness is nice, and tartness is not overpowering.

Bottle sent to me by Laz. Thanks a bunch!! Red wax on the cap. Poured into a tasting glass. Gorgeous pour of bright fuchsia/hot pink. Small white head that fades to fine lacing. Aromas are pretty abrasive! Lots of acetic acid, butter, under-ripe fruit, diapers, cabbage.....yea, not at all what I was expecting. Taste follows the nose, unfortunately. Lots of mustard seed flavor, sharp acetic acids, rotten cabbage, under-ripe fruits....pretty messy and certainly containing flavor profiles that were not intended to be here. Slightly oily in mouthfeel and light bodied with fine carbonation. Finish is dry, puckering and basically a culmination of the abrasive aromas into one final dose of deep funk. I usually like the funk, but this was not harmonious. I dont think anybody was able to finish their glass. A shame. 

Tough to write this review, as I was very excited to try this beer! I am sure this is not how the brewer intended it to taste though. A shame, considering some of the high marks it has received. Maybe one day, I will be lucky enough to try a better bottle of this one!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

Big-time citric, fruity aroma - the passionfruit shines here, but the dragon fruit also chimes. Medium-bodied and lightly creamy with lively carbonation. The flavor is tart up front, then sour and fruity, and then tart and tangy on the backside. Heaps of fruity flavor here. This is pretty much in line with other batches of DFPF Ive enjoyed.
