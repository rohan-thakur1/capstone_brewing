2532,"2016-05-09",2.3,"Kolor:  Bursztynowy. Całkowite zamglenie. 
 Piana:  Kompletnie przegazowane piwo. Piana wylewała się z butelki bez końca. Ze szkłem było podobnie. Piana ma drobną strukturę, a jej konstrukcja jest zbita jak piana po ubitym białku. Ładny lacing. 
 Zapach:  W aromacie kompletna pustka. Trochę zbóż, trawy i słodów. Pachnie jak przeciętny, podrzędny Lager. Za małą różnicą - ten nie kosztuje 12 zł. Silne utlenienie.
Przez tą pianę zupełnie nie czuć aromatów amerykańskiego chmielu;( 
 Smak:  W smaku podobnie. Totalna porażka. Słody, karmel, może jakieś kwiaty, silna trawiastość. Cytrusów tyle co na lekarstwo. Piwo jest lekkoalkoholowe, ale zupełnie wodniste i na zero ciała.
Goryczka o dziwo jest średniej siły. Finisz wyraźnie trawiasty.
Klapa jakich mało :( 
 Wysycenie:  OGROMY gushing! Potężne, szampańskie wysycenie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Wydaje się, że nie można zepsuć 2,8% piwa? A jednak można. Piwo niczym nie różni się od przeciętnego lagera. Aromatu praktycznie zerowy, smakuje jak woda z dodatkiem słodów. Do tego wodniste i ma mało ciała.
