2823,"2015-12-18",4.0,"Tap. Clearer bright gold. Savory, minerally, light grass in the aroma. Flavor features more hay, with some slight mineral and nice pillowy malt. Lighter, soft but sturdy.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
2823,"2015-07-12",3.5,"Best German Pilsner company. Another great variation. Much heavier body then the previous, if I rmember right. A little smoother at the end with less lingering bitterness.","Latrobe, Pennsylvania, USA","ryanscourt"
2823,"2015-07-02",3.9,"Poured a crisp clean golden color with a white head. Aroma was of earthy hops, cracker, dough, grass and light orangey character. Flavor similar, noble upfront, clean spicey bitterness, follow by a smooth doughy malt finish. Good, but not as good as the tettnamger.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
2823,"2015-06-30",3.3,"Very nice pilsener. Great hops, the spalt are definitely original. Light crisp barley finish. Golden pour with OK head. Tap at GBD.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
2823,"2015-06-12",3.1,"On tap at Dutchs. Clear golden color. Thin white head. Leaves some loose bits of lace. Soon fades to virtually nothing. Interesting sort of spicy aroma, just a touch musty. Some breadiness. Some strange sort of ripe apple / pear fruitiness to this. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter, with a spicy tingle all throughout. Medium body. Smooth, kind of soft lighter carbonation. Lightly slick texture. A decent pils. Solid, interesting, but I was hoping for a bit more from a Victory specialty.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2823,"2014-08-03",4.7,"[ Tap ][ 6oz ][ @Victory ][ $1.50 ][ Mini Pilsner ][ 7/25/14 ]
Listed as Braumeister Spalt @Victory. Transparent straw, effervescent with puffy white head that drops to coating and ring. Dusty grain rules nose, lightly citric with peppery accents, more orange rind sweetness than tettnanger. Biting carbonation at front is muted grains, heavy bitterness merging with toasty mid, heavy bread and crust through light lemon end, tons of toast lingering long in finish, rustic and earthy nuance accented by spritzy carbonation. More hop balance to match tettnanger, lower carbonation, but like tettnanger, grain depth and dryness overwhelmingly delicious.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
2823,"2014-05-26",3.9,"Clear golden-straw colored body with a medium sized creamy white head and soapy lacing. Assertive floral notes are complemented by a light grassy character and gentle lemon zest. Light bodied with lively carbonation and a clean, refreshing bitterness in the finish. Another top notch pilsner in the Victory lineup.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
2823,"2012-08-11",4.4,"Draft at Tria on 18th. Pours golden with an inch of white foam. Nice floral an woody notes on the nose. Big hop flavors of grass and spring flowers on the tongue. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish which is very refreshing. One of the best examples of the style Ive yet had.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
2823,"2011-03-19",3.5,"(Sample Date: 9/23/2010   Source:Other)   Spicy hop nose with light fruit and malt in the nose. Light golden, cloudy with small white head. Spicy hop flavor with fruit and malt flavor and some spicy yeast character. Moderate bitterness. Finish is mostly dry and moderately bitter.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","MaltDawg"
2823,"2010-09-26",4.0,"Growler, Shenandoah Throwdown.  Pours a slightly hazy yellow gold with a small tight bubbled white head.  Nice clean hoppy nose with a bready pils malt base, a little grassy.  The flavor is nicely bitter with a clean malt base.  Light bodied and fizzy with some slight sticky bready malt on the finish.  Nice Pils.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2823,"2010-09-14",3.9,"Growler Shenandoah Throwdown 2010.  Pours a hazed golden blond with a long lasting thin white head- med to low carbonation.  Aroma is grassy, earthy, bready light toasted malts, fresh pils, floral and light mint- slight similarity to a mt hood.  Flavor is also floral, grassy herbal hops, clean fresh bready pils malt, some mineral, slight green pepper spiciness to the hops, light mint  and green- crisp clean smooth finish- so easy drinking.  Nice!  The original from Jim Bush was even better!Earlier Rating: 7/26/2009 Total Score: 4.2Tap at BT for the Victory Promo night, listed as braumeister pils spalt select hops.  Pours a very light clean gold with a nice fluffy white head.  Aroma is a sharp yet clean spalt hops- almost mineral like, green grassy floral and lightly spicy.  Flavor is similar- grassy, mineral sharp edge to the hops, floral and definitely fresh as hell with a great clean crisp lean pils bready malt backbone- not as doughy or rich as the hallertauer- almost more mineral and lean and sharper overall.  Still awesome.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2823,"2010-08-02",3.7,"Growler courtesy of BrainLair at Shenandoah Throwdown.  This was a nice refreshing pilsner.  I guess I was hoping to like it even more than prima pils but who was I kidding.  Prima pils is the shit. This stuff is very good, but a little more grainy to primas hoppy.  I guess thats more the Czech style of pilz.   This one was very herbal and grassy and finished nice and dry.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
2823,"2010-07-16",3.7,"Growler courtesy of BrainLair at Shenandoah Throwdown. Poured from the growler a clear, light gold still with a healthy, rocky, dense, bright white head that left excellent lace. Excellent grassy and herbal hops in the nose and a bit of spicy but not metallic Saaz-like notes. Taste is clean, hoppy, refreshing, light bodied with a full buttery biscuit and fresh bread malt balance to turn it near medium bodied. Lively carbonation. Overall, another excellent pils from the only master of the style this way of Czech Republic.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2823,"2010-07-08",3.7,"Growler courtesy of Ryan & Co., Shenandoah Throwdown. Pours a bright, deep-golden color; light haze; effervescent; creamy, small-bubbled white head with solid retention and lacing. Really hop-forward, dry Pilsner aroma; lots of minerals, herbal notes, and spicy hop character, really well presented; clearn, and a lightly toasty Pils note. Really solid, hoppy nose. Medium-light body; high carbonation; non-astringent and pretty dry overall; the toasty Pils malt character shows more here than in the aroma, though still quite soft; the hop character is lightly spicy, minerally, quite ""noble"" presentation overall; the Pils note seems just a touch stale; very clean, nice and toasty, not quite enough bitterness overall, honestly. Still, very good. Medium finish of toasty Pils malt, spicy and minerally hops, light lasting bitterness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2823,"2010-05-31",3.8,"Growler from the brew pub shared by BrainLair.  Clear straw yellow pour with a white head.  Lots of earthy hops on the nose.  Some cereal.  Very dry cereal flavor with grassy notes.  Very bitter hop finish.  Notable corn flake like flavor.  Very crisp, goes down easy and refreshing.  Excellent pils.","Seattle, Washington, USA","EricE"
2823,"2009-07-16",4.2,"Not enough love from the PA guys here.  Wow, my favorite of the day, this one was deep chill hazy gold with white head and spare lace.  The nose is very Simcoey, with hints of feety and pineapply hops, pale malt, citrus.  The flavor was as good or better than the Prima I matched this with; very bold, crisp, with dominant smelly tropical resiny hops, a huge malt bill, and a tremendous crisp snappy finish that left me wishing I had brought my growler.  Truly one of the top 20 pilses I have drank, and something Ill be back for next week.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2823,"2009-06-28",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub. Tapped clear gold with a large meringue like head. The nose was all hops which come through as spicy and fruity. The flavor was crisp and spicy with a hint of earthiness. The finish lasts and lasts. Not exactly how I like my Pilseners but a well made beer.","Mountville, Pennsylvania, USA","afireinside96"
2823,"2009-06-28",3.4,"On tap at Victory (had this the other week, thanks Eric for entering it!). Poured a lighter golden/yellow color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of grassiness, some citrus, and grains. Tastes of the same grassiness, citrus, and a lighter sweetness. Light and drinkable.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2823,"2009-06-28",3.7,"[Draft @ Victory] Poured a lightly hazy golden color with a small, white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of toast, toffee malts, grass, citrus, and straw.  Taste of citrus, straw, toast, light toffee, grass, and a medium bitterness in the finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2823,"2009-02-24",3.5,"Thanks to Greg from Stone for sharing this.  Labeled as Select Pils.  Poured a clear light yellow color with a white head.  The aroma was floral, toasty and lightly sweet.  Mild malt flavor with a crisp hop finish bite.  Light bodied and dry.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
2823,"2008-05-29",2.5,"Had as Braumesiter Select Pils. The beer pours out a deathly pale yellow, small ivory white head. Aroma was celery salt, light herbal type hop. Flavor had some odd earthy/lemony thing going on. Clean finish. Fairly refreshing beer.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
