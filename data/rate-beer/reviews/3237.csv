3237,"2017-02-26",2.5,"Thank you BuckeyeBoy! 355 ml. can sampled @ RBBWG VI (2017). Apparently this is a Budweiser clone of sort, produced by a craft brewery in order to rip off beer geeks. I should be upset but I find it hilarious. Pale golden, little white head. nose is weak sugar, corn, sugar, bland, grains, faintly vegetable. Taste is weak vegetables, corn, sugar, stale, grains, low vegetables. Body is weak, oily, poor, corn, sugar. Didnt get into it but the scores on here are pretty good. Apparently they are discontinuing it now despite demand.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
3237,"2017-02-26",2.6,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2017 Shared by buckeyeboy at RBBWG. Moussy, snow white, medium thick, stable head, lightly hazy golden blonde with greenish tinge. Aroma of green grains, raw celery, soap, freshly cut grass, soggy corn, minerals. Neutral onset, typically lager, bit minerally, grainy and cereally, rounded middle, tad soapy and corn-like, grassy and very lightly floral bitterish touch in the finish; in all, tasting like a bland standard pale lager, but not the worst one around. I was hoping for an IPL (the fragrance of New World hops applied to pale lager) but this is apparently a craft brewerys interpretation (or even parody) of industrial pale lager - and in that they have succeeded.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
3237,"2016-06-19",3.3,"Draught at 12 Kings, Vancouver; 4.5% ABVHazy pale blond color. Nice crackery malts, dry but also soft mouthfeel, a bit grassy, and with a hint of summer honey. Low-ish bitterness.Nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
3237,"2016-06-18",3.2,"On tap at 12 Kings, pours a hazy blonde with a small white head. Aroma is quite restrained, with biscuity malt, a little corn and straw. Flavour is clean, with notes of straw, dry biscuity malt and little corn. Lightly sweet and even hoppy punch on the finish. Quite nice for what it is.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

3237,"2015-09-15",3.4,"Can picked up at Homebrewstuff the other day, I wanted to try this as a fridge beer for my macro friends, but Ill probably end up drinking them all. A decent bit of pale malt and cereal grains with light grassy hops. Its mild, but it should be and it actually brings some flavor to the table. Not a homer rating, this is a nice offering in the style.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"

3237,"2015-05-19",3.5,"On draft a couple of times at the brewery... Tonight enjoyed from a tulip... Slightly hazed yellow beer with an okay white head. Nose and flavor is grainy pale malt balanced just barely by some grassy/light floral hops... Pretty good for what it is. It will be pretty fantastic when it hits 100+ outside.

Tthis is a review based on the merits of the beer, I dont give a shit if you dont like Pale Lagers.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"
3237,"2015-05-13",3.8,"On Tap at the Boise brewery. Clear very light golden. Dense bright white head. Classic pale malt aromas and flavors. Very mild and soft and tasty. Low on the noble hops/bittering but maybe my favorite pf the style. Very good.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
3237,"2015-03-28",3.3,"Finally another great tasty local lager. Throwback bottles and labels are a nice touch also. WE needs to put this in cans and get it in Winco.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"
