1353,"2013-10-05",4.2,"Bottle 2013-malt, bread, fruit and some caramel in the aroma, pours clear Amber/red with a nice head and good lacing. Nice malty sweetness, bread, clean well hidden 8%.  Glad theres no smoked malt there sense its not a smoked beer.  Well done!","Washington, USA","chuckstout"

1353,"2011-12-19",2.1,"In short: A strange copper ale with too many things going wrong
How:  Bottle 22oz,.  Consumed about 4 months after purchase.  Bottle sent to me by after4ever.  Thanks Tom
The look:  Clear copper body topped by a medium beige head topped by a medium beige head with good retention and leaving lots of lacings on the glass
In long: The unusual nose has taffy candy and a leathery component that Id describe as new car smell.  Taste is taffy candy, caramel, butter, soft candies, whole-wheat bred, a lot of cologne.  Body was fluffy and foamy.  Sweetness level was only moderate for the style which is a good thing.  However the strong perfume/cologne was really annoying, the butter was gross and the leather felt totally out of place.  That beer was off on many levels, I didnt enjoy it at all.  That brewer is lucky I live on the opposite coast of the continent otherwise Id break into his home and teach his parrot to say ""I hope my wife never finds out about us"".","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1353,"2011-12-03",4.0,"Big, malty, nicely complex Scottish ale with notes of toffee and carmel. Nothing peaty or smokey here, so probably not a great example of the style, but very enjoyable.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
1353,"2011-10-22",3.6,"Bomber from Malt & Vine. Pours ruddy copper with a creamy beige head. Heavy duty caramel aroma, perhaps with a hint of peat. Full bodied. Frothy carb. Flavor is sweet caramel. There does seem to be some smoke in this. There is some floral aspect, and though it finishes sweet, the complex background flavors render that acceptable. Good beer.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1353,"2011-08-27",3.9,"Courtesy of riversideAK. Thanks Alex. Bomber pours clear copper with amber hues and off white head. The aroma is sweet caramel, apples and a touch of toffee. The taste has nice and earthy notes to start. It then rolls into lots of slick caramel notes and apple like sweetness. Yummy sweetness and solid earthy goodness all around here. Like-ing this Dicks.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1353,"2011-07-14",3.3,"Bomber courtesy of IBrew2or3.  Pours clear amber with a white head.  Nose is smoke, peat, malt, maple, and caramel.  Flavor is similar with peat and maple with slightly smokey malts.  Medium in body and finishing with lingering peaty malt.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
1353,"2011-05-23",3.8,"Bomber thanks to BrewDad. Pours a clear dark copper/red color with a small white head that dissipates. The aroma is full of fruity malts, some berries, earthy, sweet. The flavor is a nice combination of rich caramel and toffee with berries and apples, very dry and tasty. A nice example of the style.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1353,"2011-04-17",3.9,"22. Crystal clear and earthily dark amber. Dense creamy tan head. Looks like a big bad beast and made well from the moment it touches the bottom of the glass. Lots of webby lace after the sipping starts. Big sweet toffee and brown bread nose, very sweet and malty. Maybe a little dusty along with it. Creamy medium body, lively carb, big old burly ale that grabs your attention right up front. Earth, leaves, toast, caramel, brown bread, tons of flavors on the mid-palate. Long sweet caramel finish. Infinite subtle variations of malt complexity here. Granted, its a pretty huge beer, but there are plenty of pretty huge beers out there with half the complexity. Very well done.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1353,"2011-04-16",3.2,"Bottle: &nbsp Copper in color, ruby hued, thin foamy head, off-white, spotty lacing. &nbsp Peaty nose, very slight band-aid. &nbsp Otherwise soft biscuit and malts. &nbsp Not much charred wood or ash, or actually none at all. &nbsp Same on the tongue, malty, band-aid, and very peaty. &nbsp Ash, campfire, or charred wood so commonly associated, not there. &nbsp This one needs a little depth. &nbsp Despite that, its clean, has a fairly smooth mouthfeel. &nbsp Maybe a touch of Irish Moss? &nbsp Seems pretty much middle of the road to me. &nbsp Enjoyable, and happy to try something new from Dicks!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
1353,"2011-04-13",3.4,"Mahogany body with off-white, lathery head. Earthy, peaty nose. Cigar box, tobacco, and fancy leather shoe. Rich flavors. A depth of maltiness, salt, and peat, together with leather and wood. Full-bodied, mouth-filling, substantial Scotch brew that seems redolent of the old country.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
1353,"2011-04-12",4.0,"Nice nose of toffee, light leather, peat, and somewhat salty smoke. Light underlying residual sweetness. Super solid nose. Pours golden amber, lasting thin head and light lace. The flavor has notes of toffee and caramel up front with light sweetness followed by leather, peat, light salty smoke. Finish is lightly sweet and malty with barbecue, toffee, and earth. I really liked this alot, found it very drinkable, unique and enjoyable.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
1353,"2010-05-24",4.2,"Delicious.  Pours mahogany brown with medium head.  Much ringed lacing.  Malty aroma with peat smoke.  Full peaty flavour all over the mouth with some roast notes.  Finish lasts forever, half an hour later and I am still tasting it.","Munchen an der Willamette, Oregon, USA","troopie"
