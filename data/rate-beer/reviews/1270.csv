1270,"2014-07-19",3.6,"Slightly brown deep orange without much of a head. Definitely get fruit in both the aroma and flavor overlaying herbal hops and a sweet caramel base. They served this on nitro as part of the tasting flight, delicious creamy mouthfeel.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"
1270,"2014-07-08",4.0,"I have drunk many moon dog bitters from Great Lakes, and was surprised to find a different ESB on tap at the brewpub during my last visit. The malt on this one tastes less sour than I remember moon dog as (I did not try them side-by-side though), and I think the beer tastes cleaner and fresher as a result. A middle-of-the-road beer that is light in color, and much less hoppy than an IPA or Burning river, but still has relatively strong hops. I think I might prefer if Great Lakes retired moondog and replaced it with this one, but Id have to try them side-by-side to make a definitive judgment on that matter.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"
1270,"2011-01-07",3.4,"yellow with huge white head.  nose of citrus hops.  firm bitterness before nice citrus hop flavor without much malt component in this one.  the interesting malt is the creamy head and moutfeel of this beer, likely secondary to a lot of wheat malt.  overall an interesting beer that doesnt really have a style, but is mostly enjoyable","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","joshwilfong"
1270,"2010-12-29",3.8,"On-tap at the brewpub. Hazy orange-golden color, with one finger frothy white head. Smell is of citrus and slightly floral. Big biscuity malt flavor, nicely balanced with the beers light hop bitterness (even if light, it tastes more bitter than other ESBs Ive had). Medium body and carbonation.","Canton, Ohio, USA","AwYeh"
1270,"2010-10-31",3.4,"Tap at the brewery.  Deep amber pour with a thin white head.  The aroma is quite spicy with a little bit of light orange marmalade character.  A little bit earthy and lightly fruity.  Soft and spicy with a nice light lingering sweetness.  Earthy malts with some light spiciness on the finish.  Well-balanced and fairly easy to put back.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1270,"2010-08-26",3.4,"tap @ Great Lakes - golden yellow pour. Smooth caramel malts, some grain notes and even a bit warm. Drinkable but not exciting.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"
1270,"2010-07-29",3.7,"On tap at Great Lakes on our way to RBSG.  Pours a clear orange gold with a medium sized white head.  Soft and lightly bitter, toast and a bit of caramel.  Nice lightly sweet toasted malt.  Medium bodied, very gentle and easy drinking.  Soft bitterness on the finish.  Really sessionable and quite tasty.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

1270,"2009-05-18",3.4,"Sample from a growler at Goodbar Beer Club, 5/09.  Lighter gold, thin white head.  Nose is bready malts, some lemony hops, a little mint.  Flavor wise there is a really nice hop profile - mint & pine, with caramel.  Breadiness comes out in the finish.  Id love to be able to drink this regularly.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
1270,"2007-06-08",3.7,"Pours a clear copper with a creamy head that lingers and clings to the glass. Hops and a toasted malt make up the bulk of the aroma and flavor. The malt is verging on rich. Full, lingering bitterness.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1270,"2007-02-07",3.5,"Tap at the brewpub.  Aroma:  Lots of fruit in the nose.  Orange, apples, and light grape.  Some biscuity malt notes, light caramel.  Citrus and earthy hops.  Very light sulfur notes.  Appearance:  Light orange in color and slightly hazed.  Off-white head was full and foamy with decent retention.  Fair lacing.  Flavor: Bicuity malt and caramel up front.  Malt is medium sweet. Apples and oranges.  Some light resin, Floral, and earthy hops.    Medium bitterness was just right.  Medium-dry finish.   Palate:  Medium bodied.  Moderate carbonation.  Overall:  A nice bitter.  Wish GL did cask ales, cause this would be great out of a handpull.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","RagallachMC"

1270,"2007-01-27",4.0,"Pours a copper orange, thin white head. Aroma is citrus hops but more on orange and slight lemon. Same with the flavor big orange hoppy flavor along with some floral notes to it. Big toasted biscuit malt flavor that kicked ass and just tasted good. The bitterness was pretty low but the hops were still there only they didnt have a bite just flavor, very different from many hoppy beers with the orange flavor and big maltiness to it. Great beer not sure why the other ratings arent higher this is made perfectly.","Brook Park, Ohio, USA","crizay"
1270,"2005-08-05",3.8,"Draft sampler at GLBC.Light brown body under a thin head. A pleasing bitterness is the first thing you encounter. Body in fine and malty to balance, Id almost declare is ""kickass."" Darn good example of the style.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
1270,"2005-07-17",3.5,"Draft at brewpub. Poured a dark amber with a medium head that diminished quickly. Full aroma of hops. Very well balanced flavor of malt and hops with a long bitter finish. Another very good brew from Great Lakes.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

1270,"2002-06-12",3.7,"similar to their Moondog ale - just a little lighter.  very nicely balanced  - medium malt at first, followed by a very strong and short hoppy finish.  this finished ver dry. Wouldve drank this all night if I didnt want to try their other pub exclusives.  (tried at their pub 6/1/02)","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
