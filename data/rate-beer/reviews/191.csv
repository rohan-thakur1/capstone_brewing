191,"2017-04-17",4.2,"On tap at Arizona Wilderness, pours black with a small beige head. Aroma brings out loads of lacto and cocoa, smelling just like chocolate milk. Flavour is just like chocolate milk, with lots of cocoa and lactose. Amazing how close to a chocolate milk this is. Wonderful stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
191,"2016-07-03",3.9,"12 oz can that is at The Party Source. Pours a dark cola brown color with a large fluffy khaki colored head. The aroma and flavor have big chocolate character, light roast, vanilla, earthy, but it keeps going back to the chocolate, nice beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

191,"2016-04-19",4.4,"On tap at the brewpub. All the expected visuals. Downright delicious, as rich and creamy as an excellent German chocolate cake. A mere 5 oz glass will fill you up as much as any moderately-sized dessert. (#6172, 4/19/2016)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"

191,"2015-09-06",4.1,"Draft at tasting room. Deep Black. Thin khaki head. Fantastic coffee. Milk chocolate. Sweet but not overly. Vanilla isnt overdone. Lighter medium body. Just a bit of roast bitterness through the finish keeping things in balance. Maybe a bit of licorice. Molasses. Allot of malty goodness. Zero alcohol.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"

191,"2015-08-23",4.3,"Draft at the Great Nebraska Beer Festival. Nearly opaque dark brown color, brown head. Wow, nice aroma of burnt espresso and cocoa. Taste is rich, roasty espresso and chocolate milk. Delicious.  My favorite beer of the fest.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
191,"2015-08-22",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2016 A deep dark porter with almost no head, almost viscous. In aroma, sweet chocolate malt with fruity esters, dark fruits, plums, licorice, alcohol warmth, very nice. In mouth, a oily sweet chocolate malt with light vanilla, alcohol warmth, licorice notes, molasses and coffee, very nice. On tap at brewery. 8-3-8-3-13

A deep dark reddish stout with a thin mocha head. In aroma,  sweet fruity chocolate malt with light vanilla notes,  malt balls,  nutty notes,  nice and smooth. In mouth,  a nice sweet chocolate malt with light vanilla,  faint maple,  alcohol warmth,  pleasant. On tap at Khyber pass. 8-3-7-3-14","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
191,"2015-08-01",3.9,"Poured up on tap at the brewpub where it exhibits a nice deep dark body that supports a light colored mocha head. The aroma offers up fruity plum sweetness heading into increasing levels of chocolate and dark roasted malts where theres a pleasing thin burnt malt note near the end of the draw. As it warmed dark roasted malts comes to the surface. God damn, they serve the ales too cold here (WTF!). While super cold the flavor really isnt opening up but also doesnt get into astringency. I get a muted chocolate flavor blending quickly soft malty sweet dark roastiness malts and then mild molasses sweetened prunes.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
191,"2015-07-25",4.2,"Dark brown color, brown head. Love this chocolate notes in this. Its smooth, creamy and chocolates. Just the right amount of lightly toasted malt rounds this one out nicely.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
191,"2015-07-12",3.6,"Draft at the brewpub. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate, a bit of char and phenol, and some loamy soil to finish. Pours flat black with a tan ring for a head. Dominant milk chocolate flavor for the first sip with powdered cocoa and moderate lactose sweetness thats tempered by a dry earthy bitterness that bites hard at the close. Silky medium body with a almost gritty dry finish. Not bad.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
191,"2015-07-10",4.1,"Smell is roast, coffee, and cocoa. Taste is the same with the addition of a milk creaminess. Low carbonation, full body, and very slight foam. Smooth.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
191,"2015-06-25",4.2,"Very smooth, rich porter. Theres lots of chocolate and sweetness, but it seems natural. Great sweet chocolate aroma. Is this a porter or a stout, or an Easter treat? I dont really care, this makes for a nice dessert.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","DMLINAZ"
191,"2015-06-24",3.7,"Draft at the source. Deep, dark brown with a thin, fuzzy head of oak. Cocoa is huge in the nose, coating everything with bittersweet earthiness. Soft vanilla, a splash of licorice and a little acai meld in the back. The flavor is subtle up front, but a cocoa tidal wave crashes at the swallow, leaving gentle nuttiness and a hint of anise as it recedes. Great beer for those who like natural chocolate flavor.","","PartyFowle"
