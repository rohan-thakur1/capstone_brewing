1950,"2017-01-25",3.9,"Bottle shared by a generous non-RB friend. I was nervous cracking this bottle -- what was EMJ going to be like with Burgundy grapes added? It could have gone terribly, but the end product was great. The grape juice adds a lot of flavor, but it comes across as raisins (rather than Welshs grape juice), which gave it a sweet imperial stout flavor that was rich without being intense. Great, jet black color with essentially no head and moderate mouthfeel. Good, experimental stuff.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

Pours basically black with a small head and good lacing on the glass.

The aroma is odd, its odd and it s booze forward. Its grapey, roasty, a little sweet... but its not especially well balanced. 

The flavor is sort of dry with lots of raw cocoa and baking spices. At its best its akin to mulled wine, but its all sorts of boozy and it has a weird chalky dry-ish finish.

Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, grape juice, and fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, red grape, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, leather, tobacco, light char, and roast/yeast earthiness. Light amount of roasted bitterness and fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, red grape, raisin, cherry, fig, leather, tobacco, light char, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, grape juice, and fruity yeast flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an fantastic fruited imperial stout style.

Some light tannins and dark fruit, and a touch of nutmeg. The flavor is increadibly sweet, but there is a nice, light hop bitterness that balances almost perfectly. Impressively, given the ABV, there is no hint of booziness. Very heavy body, with a creamy, smooth, lightly effervescent mouthfeel. This beer is brilliant!

1950,"2015-01-20",4.0,"750 ml bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 50 degrees F.

A: Pours black, and forms absolutely no head. Not even a little bit, not even for a moment - zero head, zero lacing. It looked almost like a flat cola, except much darker.

S: Sweetness wells up out of the glass, both that of chocolate and malt, and a wine-like grape and plum sweetness. There isnt much bitterness to the aroma at all. This smells like a candy beer.

T: Rather unsurprisingly, this is a sweet stout, though perhaps less so than would be expected from the nose. Fruit notes abound, a mix of dark grapes, berries, and plums, swirling atop a baseline of bakers chocolate and faint shades of lightly roasted coffee. Off in the middle distance, some maltiness slinks about from shadow to fruity, chocolate shadow.

1950,"2014-10-29",3.9,"22oz bottle, purchased from Party Source. Shared with local beer geeks initially, but I was left with more than 50% of it to myself after the tasting concluded... Black color. Thin light brown head. Good spread of dotty lace, short ropes. Definite kind of mildly ashy roasty dark fruity aroma, definitely indicative of a foreign stout, although way stronger than typical... Lightly smokey.. The alcohol is pretty well-hidden, though. Not any kind of burn or bite, and a decently larger body to carry it. Nice dark chocolate flavors in the finish, heavy roast, some coffee... Great aftertaste. Taste... Mildly tart, kind of tannic I suppose? Maybe that is the burgundy grape juice doing its thing. Moderate to bigger bitter taste, lightly astringent, but the alcohol aspect is not bothersome at all... Just kind of drinks like a somewhat astringent, bigger bitter bigger foreign stout. So thats a plus. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of chewy, lighter carbonation. Pretty nice texture, good fullness. A nice, interesting, roasty and flavorful foreign stout that hides the alcohol pretty well. Cool, interesting stuff to sip on.

1950,"2014-10-24",4.1,"10/23/2014. 22 oz bottle purchased at Chucks 85th, poured into a snifter. Pours murky dark brown/almost black, with a thin white head that disappears quickly. Some lace on the sides of the glass that lingers. Smells of roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, a little must, some blackberry and cherry. Flavor is fairly sweet, with a mix of bitterness and sweetness in the finish, and some sourness from the grapes. Big mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, slightly oily with a long finish. A fun beer.","Washington, USA","PacNWDad"
1950,"2014-10-19",4.0,"Bottle: (Label 12.0%)
Very nearly, pure black with a thin tan head.
Chocolate, roast, coffee, red wine scent.
Smoky, deep chocolate malt, dark grape, molasses...
Sweet, berry flavours.
Ashy finish...goes slightly to the tart side after a while.
Amazingly subtle alcohol presence...gives a nice, easy warmth.
Incredibly well done.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
1950,"2014-10-15",4.7,"Pours a thick black with a small tan foam head. Aroma is smoke, roast, and oak. Flavor is roasted malts, grape, and oak, along with a touch of bitterness. Has a full body and feels smooth and chewy. I am very impressed.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"

1950,"2014-10-14",3.6,"4 oz draft pour at ChurchKey. Black with thin light tan head. Aromas of grapes, roast, light smoke, booze. Tastes of booze, grapes, chocolate, roast, bitter notes. Medium body with a dry finish. Low carbonation. Burgundy grape juice makes it interesting but I still prefer Evil Twins original.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"

1950,"2014-10-12",4.4,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter brown black with minimal tan head.
Aroma is roasted coffee with cocoa. Burgundy undertones reminds me of wine.
Flavor is outstanding blend of chocolate coffee. Definitely get the burgundy. Smooth and balanced extremely well. The levels of flavor to the palate here are complex yet it works.. A beaut of a brew. Wished we had picked up a second bottle.","Ohio, USA","fitwitchik"
1950,"2014-10-12",4.6,"Ratebeer says this is 13% abv but the bottle says 12%. Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Aroma is very subtle but if I swirl it around I pick up some grapes not much of anything else. Appearance is dark like old motor oil with a one finger tan head that vanish extremely fast. Taste is of dark chocolate and grapes though the burgundy grape juice is very subtle and gives a really pleasant twist to this beer. Palate is exceptional with good blend of viscosity and carbonation. Was very limited in Ohio as I could only get one bottle. If you can get hold of a bottle it is worth the effort. Highly recommended Cheers!","Ohio, USA","cernjoh"
1950,"2014-10-11",4.0,"Very good but a little less so than more Jesus. Big smoke and roast aroma with sharp dark chocolate. Pours black with mocha head and lacing. Bitter finish. Some coffee. Some booze. Tap at Love and Regret.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
1950,"2014-10-11",3.8,"Black pour almost no head some wine like notes flavor lends a tiny tart dark fruit quality I didnt pick up at first. Loads of molasses a but of brown sugar raisins. Good stuff","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
1950,"2014-10-10",3.7,"Pours very dark with a dense burnt orange / brown head. The aroma has chocolate, roastiness, grapes, caramel, cream, cotton candy and some berries - interesting and inviting. It has a full body that is quite smooth and has a good amount of fairly soft carbonation. The flavor begins with lots of the grape aspect up front. There is also very present roasted bitter malt, chocolate, green apple, spices, astringency, berry fruits and a bit of a medicinal note. The finish shows some alcohol and some odd complex flavor I cant really describe, but not something I expect in an imperial stout. Maybe metallic-fruity-roast is what looking to say, but thats not quite it. Good, but wouldnt need this too often.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1950,"2014-10-10",3.8,"Bottle thanks to portableparty! Rich dark black pour, almost no carbonation and an aroma of roasty chocolate. Flavor is bitter chocolate malt, green grape rinds and finished a little sweet. Decent.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
1950,"2014-10-10",3.9,"Bottle, 10/10/2014. Pours black, hazy tan head, small ring of lacing around the glass. Aroma is dark grapes, subtle berries and vinous notes, dark chocolate, touch of coffee, big roast finish. Taste is sweet dark chocolate, dark grapes, light acidity, licorice, almost smoky roast finish, coffee notes lingering. Full, silky body. Interesting, the grape juice gives this a fruity profile that reminds me of a Black Albert variant, Kabert maybe. Tasty.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
1950,"2014-10-05",4.1,"Draught. This had the same backbone as EMJ but it has notable astringency and dryness from the addition of the grapes. This made the brew less cloying and slightly more nuanced. Great all around.","Maputo, MOZAMBIQUE","Imaena"
1950,"2014-09-28",4.1,"Draft at Edmunds Oast. Obviously, same deliciousness as Even More Jesus with the addition on a slight acidity and tartness from the Grapes and also a bit more dried out and not as heavy. A fantastic beer none the less.","Florida, USA","rbrazell"
