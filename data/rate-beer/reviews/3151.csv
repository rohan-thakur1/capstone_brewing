3151,"2017-05-13",4.2,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/26/2016. Pours slightly hazy pale golden/straw color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart lemon, lime, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, guava, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, pear, green apple, citrus peel, white wine, pepper, oak, wheat, cracker, hay, straw, grass, light leather/musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, citrus/tropical hops, wine barrel, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart lemon, lime, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, guava, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, pear, green apple, citrus peel, white wine, pepper, oak, wheat, cracker, hay, straw, grass, light leather/musty funk, and yeast earthiness.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, citrus/tropical hops, wine barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; with an awesome malt/tart/spiciness balance; and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from tart/spiciness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately grainy/acidic, fairly crisp, and lightly tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.8%. Overall this is a fantastic dry hopped sour/wild ale! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, citrus/tropical hops, wine barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink with the balanced acidic/tannic finish. A perfectly balanced showcase of Brett, Lacto, and Citra hops; with great wine barrel presence. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Beaucoup de funk, darômes fermiers, du citron mais en quantité raisonnable.

Attaque très surette en bouche de par ces levures sauvages puissantes, la bière demeure dune fraîcheur extrême.

Has a lemon citrus hop on top of the sour. Base beer is on the lighter side and has almost a Chardonnay oaky dryness. I like it, but like red wine better and darker sours, so maybe the aging in white wine barrels and the dryness from that and the dry hops compound? And almost has a bit of a Brett funk, but think it is the white wine barrels with the dry hop. Still a very good sour though. Just not as balanced as some of their others in my opinion.

3151,"2015-09-05",4.3,"375 mL bottle poured. So happy to see this new unique offering from my favorite guys make it up here to Seattle so quick. So used to waiting months for them to show up, and for some, the waiting never ends. Open a brewpub! I want to come meet you and your incredible beer in person. Pours a bright orange tang color with a fizz ring head. Big lemon hops aroma. Flavor is hop forward as expected, and I was unsure how this was going to translate in a sour. Im not disappointed. Hop forward with a lingering orange fruit sourness. The big sour kick comes way late in the palate. I try to ignore all my previous love for Almanac with each beer rating, but it proves ineffective. These guys kick ass, and this beer is no exception. Hell yeah.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

Spruce, cat piss, yeast, grapefruit, lemon and horse blanket; quite a mix there. Hazy light yellowish amber with a thin bright white head. Mouth puckering lemon initially, but then a bit of sweetness as the sour fades and the saliva builds. Theres some wheat and yeasty funk in there and the hoppy bitterness comes through eventually. Nice one...very interesting.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","dfearnley"
3151,"2015-09-01",4.2,"Capped 375 from Capitol Beer in Sacrameno, CA. Pours hazy light gold with a slight white head. Aroma is sour - and for some reason mustard comes to mind. Med body or nearly. Flavor is sour, citrus, green melon and maybe some other fruits. Like white grapes. This is reasonably complex and quite tasty. Just a touch of wood in the finish.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3151,"2015-09-01",3.9,"375 ml bottle. Enjoyed at San Diego, CA. Pours a cloudy yellow colour with a small head. Aroma of fresh citrus, white bread and some earthiness. Flavour of heavy crisp citrusy bitterness, white grapes, mild sweetness, saltiness and red grapefruit. Medium bodied. Really crisp and citrusy.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"
3151,"2015-09-01",3.7,"37.5 cl bottle @ hotel room, San Diego. Aroma has citrus any bretra tones - quite interesting. Also leather shoes. Flavor has strong citrus tartness, some leathery notes and some fruity hops in the background. Also fruit candy. Rather aggressive sourness here - even a bit acidic, eats drinkability.","Tampere, FINLAND","laiti"

Pours murky yellowish with a foamy white head. Aroma of tart zesty citrusy notes, lemon, grapefruit, funky yeastiness, some juicy fruits and hops. Taste is juicy, tart and sourish with loads of citrus, lemon, funky yeastiness and hops. Finish is tart and slightly sour with loads of citrus and funky yeastiness. Nice one.","Espoo, FINLAND","tiong"

Pours cloudy yellow color with a small head. Very nice aroma here, refreshing and sour lemony, some herbal notes and mild soap tones. Quite sour lemon and citrus flavor, very tangy, gooseberries and some lactic sour notes at the very end. Unique and very tasty sour brew.

3151,"2015-08-29",4.2,"Pours a golden pale color, completely hazy beer that looks like pineapple juice with a one finger white head. The citra is noticeable in the smell. Pineapple jumps at the nose, with a bit of lactic acid and tropical fruits. T: Sour candy upfront, sour pineapple, green apples, with a hint of lactic acid towards the end. M: Rather full for the style, medium to high carbonation with nice punch of hoppy sourness. O: Almanac hasnt caught my eye in a while but this did. Glad I picked it up because this has to be among there best.","South Gate, California, USA","toxichop"
