More roasted malt, dark chocolate, and espresso than Either, with a little less milk creaminess in the nose.

The flavor starts with a light milk creaminess and sweetness, then it gets progressively darker and more bitter.  Roasted malt and chocolate wander in, with some a bit of pine in the back.  More malty than Either for sure.

Leaves very long, lingering tasty espresso bean grinds on the tongue. Has almost a deMolen quality. The extra sweetness is a wonderful addition here, adding balance whereas either has more acidity.

3977,"2011-12-21",3.7,"Entering old rates. 12oz bottle. Couleur brune foncée, col beige. Quasi la même version que la Either.

Houblon est toujours bien en balance avec des notes fruitées ; agrumes et pamplemousse et peut être un peu plus sec. Encore une fois, le prix est me semble-t-il excessif. Reste une bière solide, mais qui est un peu trop alcoolisée. Les deux sont bonnes avec assez de différence pour en justifier de les gouter ensemble. Là aussi, le miel se fait discret et se perd un peu dans un océan dalcool et de houblon. Le cèdre confère toujours cette pointe dépice boisée assez agréable et qui se combine bien avec le houblon.

3977,"2011-08-12",4.1,"Pours jet black with a minimal tan head.  Nose is coffee and malt.  I know this is ""basically a black IPA,"" but it definitely smells like a stout.  The cedar is immediately apparent when you take your first taste.  There are some slightly bitter coffee and roasted malt flavors, but the honey really does a wonderful job of balancing them.  It is very apparent, in fact, that the sweetness comes from honey.  This drinks more like a slightly hoppy, slightly sweet stout than a black IPA, but I really like it.

The nose is very elegant for some so evidently strong and assertive: licorice, molasses, a similar bouquet of hops but with a bit more citrus tang, and more notable honey in the nose as well. The honey works spectacularly well with the cedar and dry-hopping, just a kiss of citrus too (less than promised in the nose).

Pours a dark ominous thicker black pour, opaque with moderate light brown frothy haed that cakes, stays decent sized, laces a-ok overall. Aromas are a bit more on for me than its counter part, piney and citrusy hops mix with roasty malts, smoothed out silky sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee. The hops seems more prominent on the nose, resinous hops, piney, take a touch of a dominant position. Initial is full bodied, offering a thicker malt bill, roasted malts and sweet toffee mix with touches of toast, toffee and a moderate blast of piney and citrusy hops, florals and a good bitterness with some touches of ABV related heat sticking to the throat. Touches of cedar spicy wood move into it as it warms, some more sweet malts, touches of dark fruit, molasses. Some cocoa, creaminess into the body with a sticky thickness that seems to envelope the palate pretty outright. These beers generally have a hefty malt bill, some ABV warmth and a solid hopping, but not enough for me for how big they are. Maybe theyve sat for a bit. This is better than Either by a measurable amount, but Ive had better Black IPA styled beers.

Pours a black body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, darker brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Actually a bit more on the creamier side and some more lacing than the ""Either."" Aroma is very similar to the ""Either,"" but a bit sharper when it comes to the roasts and hops. Tons of toasted cedar up front with plenty of dusty and musty earthy hops. Plenty of caramel to balance, however, not quite as sweet and pronounced as the ""Either."" Lots of tobacco and some smoke, citrusy pines with light resins, roasts, dry cocoas, some pepper, and a touch of molasses sweetness behind the caramel as this warms more. Flavor has tons of sharper, heavier pines and earthy hops up front with lots of citruses. Lots of balanced, toasted cedar, roasts, tobacco, and a moderate char come in along with dry cocoas. This is slightly less sweet and juicy than the ""Either,"" but I like how the bold, deeper flavors take the forefront in this one. The pines do grow a bit sweet towards the finish with a bit of a juicy citrus, but there is more of an earthy spice that adds more complexity to the hopping when compared to the ""Either."" Finishes very dry with plenty of resiny pines, earth, toasted and slightly charred cedar, heavy roasts, and tobacco smoke all balanced nicely by a solid caramel and cocoa. Very lengthy aftertaste following a medium, very soft and creamy, almost full body with a soft, creamy, medium carbonation. This is ever-so-slightly lighter than the ""Either,"" but still drinks splendidly. Overall, this beer along with the ""Either"" are definitely my kinds of beers. Toooons of bold flavors all balanced extremely well with an exceptional palate. This one leans a bit more towards the roasts and deeper hop flavors, which I tend to like better.

A- Body is a dark, aboding motor oil black hue. Pours with a 1-2 finger creamy dark tan head. Honestly-this brew has big imperal stout written all over it in the appearance- Lacing left all the way down the glass.

S- Roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a hint of pine in the back. Roasted malt is the main character.

T- Upfront is actually a good amount of herbal hops, a hint of spicy hops, and a hint of citrus, behind this is a huge coffee roasted malt backbone. The finish offers a big dose of refreshing pine in the back and a mild amount of roasted malt lingers.

M- Medium carbonation and a medium weight body.

D- This is another interesting ""black ale"". Although this one isnt as bright and doesnt seem to be as complex as EITHER- the flavors blend together a lot better and this doesnt seem to be as much of a contrast. Overall both are pretty good beers.

flavor: sweet in general chocolate, fudge, a little bit of roast and earthy hops providing a semi-bitterness in the finish.  mouthfeel is full having a thick texture to it. a little bit too sweet for my liking. or has a similar overall sweetness but the piney hops and cedar come through in a way that enhances its flavor.  mouthfeel is equally full.

3977,"2011-02-11",3.7,"A vigorous pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a four finger thick, nicely browned, dark tan colored head.  The beer is an approaching black, concentrated brown color that shows brown notes around the edges when held up directly to the light.  This is extremely hoppy and fresh smelling with notes of tangelo zest, lychee and lots of herbal notes that contribute notes of pine and even some nutty hemp seed aromatics.  There is a soft, supporting malt character here that provides notes of toasted / roasted malt and even hits of spicy grain (more crystal malt than rye).  This really is quite hop dominated though; the fruit-leaning hop character also contributes notes of ruby red grapefruit juice, concentrated floral tropical fruit notes.  At times the roast malt character is quite a bit noticeable (though still plays a secondary role), but at others it is quite consumed by the hop character.  As the beer warms up a spiciness and a touch of hot alcohol starts to come out a bit more, though the fruity hop character is certainly still the dominant note.

Lightly sweet tasting up front, but it is hoppy enough that it has a certain dryness to it.  As it rolls across the tongue an amped up fruit-hop character combines with the malt and accentuates a smooth sweetness; the combination provides flavors of lychee, orange blossom nectar, concentrated tangelo zest as well as kumquat zest flavors.  The finish has an herbaceous hop bitterness to it that is a bit green at times and gets accentuated by a roast / burnt roast malt character.  Despite how dark this beer is, the roast malt character is actually fairly subtle, really it is just that the hop character is quite aggressive and is most noticeable in the finish, though there is a touch of dark cocoa in the middle that subtly contributes to the flavor profile.  The body of this beer has some viscosity to it and some heft, though the hops help to balance this out quite well and make this quite quaffable.  There is a touch of heat that provides a warming to the finish of this beer.  Toasted, woody and earthy notes are found here in the finish and contribute a complexity here that is quite nice.

This is quite nice and tasty, once again though I am of the opinion that the dark / roast malt is just getting in the way in this beer.  It adds a harshness to the finish that accentuates a green, sharply herbal note towards the finish; traditional, pale malt IPAs provide a cleaner focus on the hop character that just works better.  Having said that, this is still a thoroughly dominated, hop focused beer that will satisfy the inner cravings of your inner hop-head.  I am almost done with this beer before I knew there was cedar used in this beer; it integrates quite well with the hop character and perhaps contributes an herbal, spicy and woody character that melds into similar hop notes.  Interestingly enough it also integrates quite well with the toasted / roasted malt character as well.  Actually in the end I would guess that the cedar character really helps to tie together the disparate roast character and aggressive hop notes quite a bit more than would otherwise be the case.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3977,"2011-02-02",3.5,"Common Rating for Either Black Ale  and Or Black Ale
In short: Big boozy roasted chocolaty beer with aggressive green and resinous bitterness.  Good sipper.
How: Bottles 12oz (Either + Or) side by side, fresh, about 1 month after the beers release
The look: Black body topped by a medium beige head leaving good lacings.  Either version has a slightly better head retention.
Mostly common between OR and EITHER versions: Uber-hoppy nose with a very fresh green hop peletts signature.  Taste has chocolate, medium roasted level, some dry wood.  There is a little toasted wood notes that dry out the beer a bit but I would not have guessed this was cedar barrels aged.  Very assertive bitterness that is both citrusy and resinous.  Appropriately smooth carbonation.  Tasty aggressive beer that are nonetheless pleasant to drink.
Differences between OR and EITHER versions: Either was more chocolaty and had a richer fuller body.  Or version had more honey sweetness.  Alcohol was a bit more apparent in Or version and was a bit bothersome. 
Bottom line: I found the Either (8-4-7-4-15=3.8) more interesting than the Or (8-3-7-3-14=3.5).  Im surprised by this result because I usually much prefer Hill Farmstead products over Cigar City.  The girlfriend and I drank both beers in presence of the Hill Farmstead assistant brewer.  He was very curious to know my opinion.  I told him the truth that I preferred the Cigar City version.  My mother always told me that it cost nothing to be honest.  And my father also told me that stealing peoples wallets not only costs nothing but can also generate a little profit.

The taste was drier than Either and, again, more nuanced, but some notes clashed a bit and the more muted sweetness made it stand out a bit more than in Either.

3977,"2011-01-15",3.7,"Draft at redlight and from bottle. Tasted side by side with Either. This is the Vermont/Denmark version with the pils malt and hop resin. This one pours nearly pitch black as well and topped by a moderate sized head of mocha colored foam that settles quickly to a thin film. Sticky flares of lace cling to the glass and slowly make their way back down to the body. The aroma is really green and hoppy showing plenty of grass and pine resin. Orange citrus and spicy cedar add to the hop profile. The malt base is comprised of dry chocolate, toasted caramel and bread. The flavor follows and is immensely green and bitter from the pine and resinous hops and the spicy, peppery cedar. The hop prove dominant over the underlying malt base of dark, bittersweet cocoa and dry caramel. Some chocolate roast comes through on the finish which blends well with the hop bitterness. Full bodied, smooth with balanced carbonation and a lengthy warming finish from the alcohol. Another really nice black ipa, but just a little more aggressive and unbalanced with the hops and doesnt hide the alcohol quite as well as the Either version.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

3977,"2010-12-17",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2011 My Bottom Line:
Toasted cedar and pils malts are a match made in heaven, it seems, for this Barrel-Aged Imperial Black IPA, where citrusy hops, roasted angles and deep molasses are all perfectly harmonious.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the blackened brown.
-Alcohol is very well hidden throughout.
-Soft carbonation lets the palate perceive the mesmerizing cohesion of all ingredients.
-This one is perhaps not as intense as its Either counterpart, but it is much more evocative to my palate.
-This is quite sweet and not as elegant as Hill Farmstead brews. Still, a great sipper from beginning to end.

3977,"2010-12-15",3.7,"12 oz bottle.  Didnt realize these two new CCB brews were 10%+ ABV but i feel compelled to rate them back to back.  Ebony with a tan head.  Nose is chocolate, catty hops, coffee and cedar.  Almost full body with a tang.  Taste is honey, licorice and grapefruit peel.  Hoppier than the Either, less of the cedar and not quite as nuanced.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3977,"2010-12-12",3.9,"This poured a jet black color with a large light brown head. Aroma was lots of dark roasted malts and some fresh herbal and spicey hops. Flavor was very roasted but not burnt, balance by a good amount of hops but not nearly as bitter as the either.

3977,"2010-12-12",4.0,"Poured from an 12 ounce bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. Purchased along with Either at Cigar City Brewing taproom on 11/20/10.

Appearance: Pours a coffee black color with a 1-2 finger foamy tan head. Looks like a stout. Excellent lacing.

Smell: Piney hops, bitter citrus, roasted malt and mildly astringent alcohol.

Taste: Pine with a hint of citrus up front followed by warming alcohol in the middle then ending with roasted malt and coffee at the finish. Distinct cedar notes throughout. Aftertaste is bitter hops. Flavor definitely expands as it warms up.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very creamy and prickly at the same time.

Drinkability: Decent drinkability. This is a beer I would drink slowly. Because of the high ABV, I wouldnt drink more than one.

Overall: Good beer overall. This is another solid offering from Cigar City. Id have a hard time recommend trying this because its $7.50/bottle. If you dont mind the price, its definitely worth giving a shot.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

3977,"2010-12-09",3.9,"Bottle. Poured into a large tulip glass a very dark brown/black color with a medium sized bubbled tan head that slowly recedes. An interesting aroma; grassy, roasted malt, woody, and almost an underlying mint but this could be the toasted cedar throwing me off. Medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation. The first thing I notice is the sweetness of the honey followed by the toasted cedar flavors. The hops are there and in abundance with notes of citrus rind. Nice lace left on the glass. The alcohol is not as noticeable as I would have thought. I get some licorice flavors in this as well. This has a pretty bitter lingering finish that but also leaves your lips slighlty sweet. Overall, pretty good but for $7.50/12oz bottle, its a little bit on the steep side.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
3977,"2010-12-08",3.3,"355mL courtesy of tastybeer. Poured a near black, more deep brune, with a thin, creme, tan head leaving minuscule lace. Aroma is a very odd mix of Indian food, curry, samosas, spiced and cooked mangoes, tropical fruit marinaded steak. Here, whatever spice the cedar is producing is not harmonizing well with the tropical hops. It leaves an end note not unlike pineapple marinated Hawaiian steak. Taste is cedar up front, spices, curry, marinated steak, burnt sugar, big time smoked malt character. Palate is dry, prickly, relatively viscous and lively in carbonation. Overall, this would do very well as a smoked porter.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

3977,"2010-12-01",3.3,"Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass. 

Pours near black with a finger-and-a-half of light mocha head and some pretty good lacing as it goes down. Nice retention with some sticking power thats greater than what I found in the Either without a hard swirl. The nose is a bit hoppier than Either, with some citrus notes coming through as well as earth. The earthiness of this is quite prominent alongside a bit of roast.

The flavor starts out with some citrus hops and a bit of tangerine peel. After that comes a touch of light sweetness as well as some roast. A pretty good amount of booze is here as well, though not nearly as much as in Either. Medium body and not quite as creamy as Either, though the lack of alcohol dominance is nice. There are some hops in the finish, which is fairly dry.

Full body with a slippery viscous mouth feel and gentile carbonation. This beer is fairly sweet as to be expected with a fair amount of earthy hop bitterness, an overall spiciness from the cedar.  The big difference I found in Or from Either was a larger, brighter hop presence in Or, the roasty chocolate quality is still here but I get much more of a orange citric note.

Sort of like Either the beer enters smooth and near velvety but with a bit brighter notes. I get malt sweetened tangelo, orange juice and sugary grapefruit juice followed by lesser notes of dark roasted malts, some cedar spice, chocolate and then more citrus.

3977,"2010-11-25",4.4,"""Acquired"" from grassrootsVT as part of a set with EITHER. Tasted side by side. 12oz pry-top brown glass bottle. No date.

Pours a thick viscous black with some creamy dark tan head that stays longer than OR and is also darker in color. Leaves no lacing.

Nose: Dark and angry bitter chocolate notes, dusty hop flowers (dried), sticky weed. Dry dry dry and roasty smelling compared to the slick-smelling EITHER.

Palate: Palate is lighter and a little more ""lifted"" feeling. Cedar is not as aggressive as in OR and the body is a little lighter (a good thing). Wet, juicy, pot-like hops ooze throughout the palate and are supported by the spicy, peppery cedar. Carbonation is creamy, true to form with Shaun Hills beers and keeps the palate from becoming cloying.

Notes: Appearance is better on this one. Aroma is more muted than ""Either"" but the palate is far superior! Much more bitter (from the hops) than ""Either"" and is more lively both in terms of carbonation and flavor. ""Or"" seems to have a little less extraction of the malt and therefore allows the individual components to shine through a little more instead of getting mucked up together. The texture is perfect and the finish is elegant. The winner by far!","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SFLpunk"

Black malt sweetness intertwines nicely with citrusy, grassy, piney hop bitterness. The high ABV is cloaked nicely.  Burnt, grassy, hempen finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

3977,"2010-11-21",4.6,"Much like its companion beer, Either, this one pours a dark black/brown with a strong tan head. 

Stronger hop character in the aroma, but still hints of malt, dark fruit that unique touch from the cedar.

Slightly drier mouthfeel and finish with much more pronounced hop flavor and less emphasis of the earthiness of Either. However, theres still a unique tart from the cedar. Feels much more like a black IPA to me with the resinous backbone and drier finish, but still well balanced for such a big beer. 

Drinking them side by side allows for a good comparison of the differences, for sure. Enjoyed the Either, but preferred the Or, only because it really hits home as a BIPA to me.","Derby, Vermont, USA","GatheringBrews"

3977,"2010-11-19",3.5,"Ok so Im going to rate this about a 3.5 but here is the thing. For a black IPA this beer is very good. But I had this at the same time as the Either and to be honest the hops really dont need to be there. The Either is by far a better beer the hops just seem to bleed out the nice complex flavors of the Either. 
Ok  first take is ton of roasted malt with a nice clean pine hop finish. The honey is kind of lost in the mix between the malt and hops and I got little no wood flavor out of this. Very smooth and drinkable for 11%. If you at a bar that has both Either and OR and you only have 10.00 get the Either but they are both great beers. WTG CCB","Pennsylvania, USA","greencatfish"

Looks nearly identical to the Either, and a couple of points Id see people get both and then get all confused as to which one they had.  Similar aromas to the Either, but more coffee notes with a bigger amount of spicy raw hops.  Sweet roast, but again the big spiciness of the hops cuts right through.  Long char, roast and a great quinine note on the finish.  Both amazing, but definitely distinct.  I just realized that I had meant to at some point blend the two together and forgot.

3977,"2010-11-17",3.7,"Bottle from Knightly.  Sampled the same night as the Either.  The appearance is the same; pours almost black with a thin mocha head.  The aroma shows cedar and roasted malt along with leafy hops, damp wood, and subtle chocolate.  Maybe Im just looking for it more but the cedar is more prominent in the nose than the Either but perhaps not as complex.  The flavor really shows sharp cedar and leafy hops.  Overall a bit green.  Strong toasted grains mix in with some chocolate but the chocolate seems overpowered by the sharper flavors.  Im not really getting much, if any, citrus here.  Dry, and long-lasting bitterness in the finish with plenty of lingering cedar notes.  The Either and Or are very similar for sure, but I found this one to be a bit sharper with the cedar and hops and I guess rougher around the edges.  Somewhat gritty.  Both are very good but I thought the Either was the better drink.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

3977,"2010-11-12",3.7,"Draft at Redlight Redlight.  I had the ""Either"" and the ""Or"" side by side, and will combine my rating for comparison purposes.  The score for this entry is the ""Or"" version.Or.  This is the Denmark/Vermont version with the Pilsner malt base and bittering hop resin.  The body is basically pitch black, sporting a moderately sized, smooth, cappuccino colored head that settles fairly quickly to a thin surface film.  Tall feathers of sticky lace cling hard to the glass.  Aromas are intensely hoppy and green, loaded with leafy resins and alpha acids.  Orange pith lends a bold citrus hop contingent, and spicy cedar serves as a nice compliment to this aspect.  In the malt base, dry chocolate and toasted caramel are accompanied by notes of toasted bread crust.  Flavors again kick off with the strikingly bitter, green, resinous hops and the peppery cedar, which prove dominant over the underlying dry, dark, bittersweet cocoa.  Caramel and dry chocolate roast come across almost ashy at points, intensifying the bitterness of the hops.  The palate, as expected for an 11% beer of this nature, is quite weighty, sporting smooth, even-keeled carbonation and sticky, tacky finish.  Overall, I liked it quite a bit.  Its certainly the more aggressive and unbalanced of the two.  ""Or"" score: 7/4/7/3/16 = 3.7Either.  This is the Florida version with the pale malt base and all pellet hops.  Also pouring pitch black, the body props up a moderate, spongy, mocha colored head that lasts for a good long while.  Sticky, feathered bands and flares of lacing coat the glass well.  The overall appearance rivals just about any imperial stout.  Speaking of which, the nose is far more balanced and stout-like than the Or version, as rich chocolate roast does well to assuage softer citrus and grassy hops.  Cedar is less prominent (you actually have to search for it), and there are deeper nuances of tobacco and dark fruit.  Flavors follow suit, showing a rich, roasty chocolate malt base with notes of stewed figs and maybe even some black strap molasses.  Grassy hops are still there en masse, but they are far more rounded and subtle.  The same can be said for the cedar, which lends just a bit of soft spice throughout.  Mocha really comes through on the finish.  On the palate, the roundness of the huge malt contingent is evident as the hefty body rolls and glides over the tongue.  Carbonation is spot on, which is to say softly persistent.  The finish is sticky and somewhat cloying, but not overtly so.  Overall, I found this to be much more approachable and well rounded.  Both are very good beers, but this one would be my top choice.  ""Either"" score: 8/5/8/3/16 = 4.0","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
