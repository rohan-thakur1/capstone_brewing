Beer pours dark brown with a head that is light tan/beige. The aroma is caramel and toffee, with a little bit of dark fruit as well. The flavor follows the aroma, with caramel malts, roasted malts and a little chocolate flavor. The mouthfeel is medium thickness and is very creamy. A very good beer, the best I have had from Franconia. This is an extremely drinkable, flavorful bock.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

4197,"2009-11-03",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2009 Special tap at the Gman FW. Dark red cherry pour. Smells mainly of sweet malts. Has some aged fruit like sweet grape or black cherry but only a hint. Taste has an upfront tingle. A dry, chalky feel also fills in the taste. Finish continues the dryness with a tad bit of bitter dark malts. An interesting take on the German bock. Would like the sweetness in the aroma to continue through the taste.  Thanks to Matt for letting me try this.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
