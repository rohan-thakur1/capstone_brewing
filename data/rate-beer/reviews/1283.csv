Taste is cold tea, toffee, herbal bitterness, smoke. Good one - at times I started thinking I was drinking something from Blighty. Well done, Romania!","Moscow, RUSSIA","YantarCoast"
1283,"2017-04-22",3.5,"On tap at Beer oclock Bucharest. Well... Fine aroma, currant, hops, reddish dark colour, short white head. Tastes of currant, sweet and sour, bit of hops, but not very bitter. Unbalanced body, short finish, should get some care and it might be very nice drink.","SLOVAK REPUBLIC","kamanova_boy"

Very good, balanced and with a perfect appearance!","Chișinău, MOLDOVA","GhostS"
1283,"2017-04-05",3.7,"Bottle shared. Semi-hazy dark caramel pour with a tall beige head that gives way to a think lacing. Notes of caramel, butterscotch, dried fruit bitterness and light sweetness, toffee, bitter citrusy hops, a bit of hop funk, light resin. A very good ESB, nice and smooth body,","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","mariuspoenari"
1283,"2017-03-30",3.7,"This was my first ESB and i was pretty impressed. First time i tried on tap from the first batch which was pretty fresh, brown hazy color with yeast floating particles, medium bitterness, caramel flavor, brown sugar, herbs, good carbonation, small body. Second time i tried it on 500 ml bottle which was expired with 2 weeks over the term, i was still surprised how good the aroma lasted. I guess even expired you can tell its a good beer build.","Bucharest, ROMANIA","Qnex"
1283,"2017-01-24",3.5,"Dark amber with beige head which dissipates quickly. Aroma is caramel, toast and roasted walnuts. First sip is sweet toasted malt, St Johns wort tea, caramel with a bit of bitterness to balance things out. Bitter medicinal plants. Oily. After more sips, some hops appear. Unusual and pleasant.","Cluj-Napoca, ROMANIA","geolgau"
1283,"2017-01-10",2.8,"Bottle, thanks ciocanelu! Hazy reddish-amber color with white head. Aroma is caramel, toffee, some apples, some earthy hops. Taste is apple phenols, more toffee. Oily mouthfeel. A bit too phenolic, but okay.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"

1283,"2016-12-24",3.5,"BOTTLE 50 CL from the brewery. Hazy red, beige head. Some sticky caramel, that slowly turns into a buttery and nutty cake. Light hoppy notes, ranging from wild to somewhat medicinal herbs. The taste is moderately sweet, caramel, just a little bit of toasty notes, pretty robust dry herbal bitterness (again, slightly medicinal). A bit peculiar, but well done.","Chișinău, MOLDOVA","dnicolaescu"
1283,"2016-12-14",3.7,"Almost clear dark amber color with beige head. Aroma has mostly buttery caramel and toasted malts. Taste follows with the buttery note but not in the bad way, it really fits with the toasted malts, slightly nutty with some burnt milk notes. Some earthy, slightly floral hops on the finish which give a good amount of bitterness to balance out the beer. Light body, well carbonated. A really good example of an ESB.","Timisoara, ROMANIA","ciocanelu"
1283,"2016-12-09",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2016 On tap at Beer O?clock, Bucharest. Dark amber, with little head. Sweet malty nose and taste with some shy bitterness. Low carbonation. I am not a fan of the style, but this is a very pleasent surprise. Great brew.","Iasi, ROMANIA","m.mahu"
1283,"2016-12-05",3.8,"Hazy amber with weak head. Faint caramel aroma with some floral hops and fresh cut gras notes.
Low carbonation (as it should).

Classic bitter taste with agressive notes tropical flowers, bit of cocoa and a hint of agave syrup. All this on a solid harsh caramel malt backbone. I would say it is a bit boozy and some astringency is present also. The ending is bitter and goes it out in a whirlwool tropical the same flower perfume, but this time milder.","Bucharest, ROMANIA","chk230"
