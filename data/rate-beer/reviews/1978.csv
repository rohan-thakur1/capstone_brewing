1978,"2017-02-01",5.0,"Classification en foreign stout, étrange à un point paroxystique, puisquil sagit dune recette historique dun stout anglais !!! Il ny a donc rien de moins ""foreign"" que ceci, à mon sens, mais 
peut-être ai-je glissé sur la savonnette !! Bref, cest sans doute un trait dhumour anglais 
On reste ébahi 
Remarquable série par contre que cette ""past masters"", qui remet sur la scène des bières du passé,
pour nous permettre de revivre des époques glorieuses de notre breuvage préféré .. Bravo Fullers.
Seul reproche bien sûr : il faudrait que ceci ne soit pas en série limitée !!!
Niveau abv de 7,4 %, en format 50 cl.
Mon exemplaire pouvait attendre encore deux années entières .. je lai arrêté dans ses réflexions ...
Couleur noir intense, à lopacité quasi totale.
Mousse brun moyen, épaisse, avec des cratères en haut, stable à 6 mm.
Arômes de café, chocolat, ganache, cappuccino, strachiatella, malt torréfié.
1ère bouche souple à structurée, à la grande entame malt torréfié/charbon de bois.
Arrière-bouche dense, forte, à lamertume très définie et décisive.
2ème au très grand ensemble, torréfié, construit.
Arrière-bouche profonde, avec tabac, feu de camp très doux au clair de lune.
3ème au merveilleux assemblage des saveurs.
Arrière-bouche qui donne la direction du vent !! (cf le feu de camp ..)
Longueur à lexceptionnelle intégration de toutes les saveurs trouvées jusquici, avec des baies 
noires, bois brûlé, café, malt, etc etc.
Levure douce, précise, belle ligne.
Alcool très bien .. ce nest pas tous les jours que lon trouve ce niveau en Angleterre, et on voit bien
ici tout lintérêt de cette valeur sur les saveurs.
Finale superbe.
CONCLUSION : une bière que lon pourrait qualifier de ""vraie"", dans le sens authentique, profonde, historique .. Je ne comprends pas labsence de 5 sur 108 ratings !!! Amis anglais, vous
perdez vos valeurs en ne portant pas pareille bière sur un piédestal .. Mais, avec le brexit, vous 
allez peut-être les retrouver !!!","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

A lot of pleasant roasted notes as well on the nose. Roasted coffee and some chocolate notes in taste. Fairly dry mouthfeel. Quite heavily bittered this one, but that is just making this brew very drinkable at the same time. Behind the roasted and bitter chocolate lurks even some dark berries from time to time. The finish is though quite on the roasted side, long-lasting as well. As said the drinkability is just great here. Theres even a hint of charchoal and cocoa powder stepping up later on. Dry, slightly bitter and chocolatey finish.","FINLAND","RexTalionis"
1978,"2016-02-13",3.9,"Bottle from Alko Arkadia, Helsinki. Pours nearly black with a medium-sized light brown head. The aroma showcases a diverse, potent malt character: glimpses of roasty malty notes appear with dark chocolate, espresso and dark, plummy fruitiness  pretty much what the label promised. Taste is tilted toward a dry, roasty direction as sweet malty notes are very quickly swept aside; medium to heavy roastiness fills the palate. Flavours of coffee, chocolate and some rye bread with only a hint of plum. Lightly bitter finish. The palate is medium to full bodied, average in carbonation, fairly smooth. Rich and balanced quality stout  you can expect these from Fullers.","Helsinki, FINLAND","Marstonlad"
