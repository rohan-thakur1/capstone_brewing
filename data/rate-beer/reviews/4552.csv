Chalky Saaz nose, gives way to a chewy pale malt body and deliciously fragrant, peppery hops. Slightly oily, adhesive palate, adding to the rich tastes staying power like pungent mustard on fresh, buttered bread crust. Spicy, lingering finish.

4552,"2013-06-30",3.7,"1L PET bottle thanks to Mowbeer! Pours a clear golden with poofy white foam. Nose is buttery, heavy cereal, pretty over the top on diacetyl moving close to a rancid dairy character. Taste is much better with butter balancing soapy/grassy Czech hops, heavy caramel and big honey. Cheerios, cereal, bread, sweet roll- lots of body to balance out the hop bite. Quenching, clean body. Very nice despite the heavy butter aroma.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
