Some dried pineapple, apricot, and peach preserve. Lemon juice sourness along with a bit of lactic yogurt character. A touch of cereal flavor and sweetness to this, sort of like Wheaties, maybe. A bit more funky than expected.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3911,"2016-02-12",4.2,"From notes. 4-5 ish oz pour on draft at FoBAB on November 21. The pour is a little different. Its a murky orange gold color with a thin layer of white colored head and no lace as it vanishes. There is a sour lemon skin at the beginning of the aroma. A solid peach slowly moves in and its got a strong mustiness. This is a unique smell for sure. Musty and juicy with a tart and sour lemon. The flavor is excellent. There is a ton of peach juice. Its like Im eating one of the damn things. There is a beautiful tartness and just a hint of souring toward the back end. The mouth feel is light and crisp, dry and tart, with a light carbonation and a lingeringly dry peachy finish. This is very good. If it werent for the off aromas, this would be phenomenal.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3911,"2015-10-29",3.9,"On tap at GTMW 2015

Poured from a bottle, this release captured my attention due to a deScriptive entry in the program guide. Im glad I stopped by because the experience was just shy of world class. The only thing I might disagree with is that it tastes much more like an American wild ale than anything that resembles a berliner weisse.

Aroma / Appearance - A hazy peach colored body glistens beneath weak snowflake tinted flecks of foam. Tart peach pie hones in on the goal with a bright crisp focus.

Flavor / Palate - Peaches that have soured in the can open with a metallic acidic tang. The dry finish opens up slowly with waves of salt. Regardless of how you pigeonhole this beer the results are top notch. I wish I had been able to bring a bottle home to share with the locals.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3911,"2015-10-18",3.7,"Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. Shared by Luk_, thanks! Cloudy-milky-dirty orangey with a small ring of white foam. I couldnt say its good looking. Aroma is incredibly peachy and juicy. Theres also a moderate tartness that seems to carry the peach flavor even more. Its a bit lactic, but not just plain lactic as some boring Berliner Weisse... theres definitely some complexity and depth here, its just that its a bit hidden a metric fu**ton of peaches. Taste isnt too sour and, like aroma, its massively peach forward. Body is medium. Carbonation is medium as well. Juicy peaches finish. Its kind of drinkable because its not too puckering, but its also so peachy that it could get cloying. That being said,this is a pretty solid fruited Berliner.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
