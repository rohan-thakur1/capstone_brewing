2185,"2015-04-17",2.8,"Draft->snifter at Churchkey. Finally a sahti. Amber-brown with offwhite head. Taste is odd, with grape must, herbs, spice, and what must be spruce. Not really getting this.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","DCLawyer"

2185,"2015-04-01",3.1,"4 oz pour on draft at ChurchKey. Finally my first sahti tick. Dark red/brown with off-white head. Aromas of vinegar, light salt, subtle tart notes and dark fruit. Tastes of dark fruit, plums, light red wine, subtle tartness. Medium-light body with a dry finish. Not quite flat but low carbonation. Not a huge fan.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
2185,"2015-03-30",3.1,"Draft at Churchkey. Deep clear ruby amber color, bright tan head. Aroma of light Christmas trees. Taste is malty and herbal, a bit on the sweet side.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2185,"2015-03-29",2.5,"Tap at Lord Hobo. Pours a murky brown with no head and thus no lacing. Not off to a good start... Nose is of roasted malt, banana and chocolate cake, sweat and spices. A little vegetal too, which I guess must be from the juniper. Taste is weird and features more bananas, chocolate, rotten fruits and juniper. A little tart in the finish. Body is medium and carbonation really light. Overall that was awkward but I guess traditional sahtis were closer to this one than Ale Apothecarys for instance.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2185,"2015-03-25",2.5,"On tap @ Lord Hobo, 

Appearance: Muddy brown with no head and no lacing. Ugly. 

Aroma: Tons of spruce along caramel and spices. 

Taste: Similar to aroma. Moderately sweet. Lots of spruce along caramel and christmas spices. Light bitterness. Light acidity.

Palate: Medium body, but watery. Still. Resinous/spruce finish. 

Overall: Lack of balance, bubbles and body. Flavorful, but not necessarily in a good way. Anything good about this beer? It was fun to make Minderbinder believes it was another beer so that he would drink another sip of this.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2185,"2015-03-24",2.9,"On tap at Lord Hobo.
Pours very hazy brown with no head. Aroma is of lots of spices, bananas, bubble gum. Taste: cherries, dark fruits, malt, caramel, very slight smoke, sugar. Palate: Medium-full body. Sticky on the lips. Soft carbonation. Overall: Not very enjoyable.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
2185,"2015-03-24",2.2,"On tap at Lord Hobo. Murky muddy brown black pour with no head. Sprucy, earthy, woody aroma, tree bark, mushrooms. Yeasty flavor, light sweetness, earthy bretty notes, like an infected belgian dubbel, spruce, light herbal flavors. Palate is almost completely flat, sweet-ish, a bit watery. Bleh.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

2185,"2015-03-08",3.3,"Spuytin Duyvil, Brooklyn tap: Pours murky brown with no head really. Aroma is kind of like kvass, some funk, and earthiness. Taste is lightly tart and very malty. Some sweetness. Things I would consider spice. Body is relatively flat. Interesting.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
2185,"2015-03-08",3.5,"Tap at Tørst, NYC.
Dark brown color, not much head. Aroma is sweetish banana with light herbal notes. Medium-bodied, low carbonation. Good sweet banana flavor with toasted notes and herbal juniper-like bitterness. Quite close to original Sahti and very taste. A bit different than Lammin Sahti at home, but certainly brewed nicely to the style. Probably the best Sahti ever brewed in USA.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"
2185,"2015-03-01",3.6,"Growler thanks to Jow. Pours darkest brown white head. Nose/taste of banana, cocoa, bubblegum, tree bark and earthy juniper. Light toasty Danish bread. Lighter medium body.",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"

2185,"2015-02-27",3.8,"Ive become obsessed with trying as much of this style as possible. So when some came available in NYC I was all over it.. Pours deep brownish amber. Nose is lovely juniper and toffee. Tastes of junipers, banana, bubblegum, toffee, malt, bready, and light alcohol. Semi flat palate as to be expected with sweet and sour after taste. Lovely i am going plan Finland trip as soon as I can.","New York, USA","Jow"
