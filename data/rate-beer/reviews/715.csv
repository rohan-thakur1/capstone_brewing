715,"2016-04-18",3.5,"Draft at Als / Pizza Boy in Enola.
Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.
Body is medium to dark amber.
Aroma is lightly malty (caramel, toasted grain), moderately hoppy (apricot, orange, grapefruit, resin).
Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.
Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.
I have to give credit to PB for getting good hop expression...most Simcoe beers reek of onion, but this is a fruit bomb, as are most of their hoppy brews. Nice beer if a tad sweet.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

A - Pours clear amber orange with a nice one and a half finger tall white head leaving small trails of lace down parts of the glass.

S - Smells of citric and grassy simcoe hops with some spicy rye helping to keep them in check. Some caramel and light fruitiness offers some additional flavors but this one is all about the simcoe and rye.

T - Starts off with a quick hit of spicy /  chewy rye quickly being enveloped by the strong citric hop bite from the simcoe hops. Hints of fresh cut grass, caramel sweetness and dulled tropical fruit help round things out. Finish is chewy with plenty of lingering hop bitterness.

M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Bitter, chewy feel from start to finish. Some light sweetness and booze creep in toward the end of the glass.

O - Even with all of the assertive flavors this one remains easy to drink. If you have a chance to try this one I suggest you do, it is one of Pizza Boys better beers to date.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
