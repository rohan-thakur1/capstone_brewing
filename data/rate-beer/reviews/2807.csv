2807,"2017-04-04",4.4,"Mate, this beer was fucking fantastic. The description on the label sucked me in I will admit. Sounded appealing. The price was not appealing however. Once opened though it comes across more like a berry driven and extremely juicy half sour half pils kind of thing. So juicy and has those light red wine tannin-like notes. Very good drop","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
2807,"2017-03-11",3.8,"Bottle shared by a friend. Pours gold/amber with a medium white head. Aroma of malt, lime and sourness. Malt and lime flavor with sour accents before a floral finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
2807,"2016-12-20",3.9,"Bottle in PDX. Pours a golden color with a medium white head. A big funky nose, clear key line, tropical. Clear pilner elements, sour fruity bite, vinous, I really get a lot of funky brett in here. Kinda like a funky tart fruit pilsner. But it works! Quite nice.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2807,"2016-11-20",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a lightly hazy deep gold. Small white head. Aroma is Lime with a bit of funkiness. Light vanilla. Light picks malt cracker. Taste is initially a mix of tart lime, bitter, and a modest funkiness. Wouldnt say it is like key lime pie but it is very nice lime beer with a pleasant wine barrel character.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
2807,"2016-07-04",4.2,"Looks and feels like a Pilsner, and has that crisp malty backbone, but otherwise unlike any beer Ive ever had. Dont think they could have done better with what they had. Perfect balance of base beer, slightly funky sour wine character and key lime pie flavor aroma and tartness, all the way to a crust like aftertaste. You know a beer is great when youre sad its gone.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2807,"2016-06-12",3.7,"Bottle shared by BuckeyeBoy, thanks! Golden yellow color with a small white head. Nose is lively with lime and the barrel notes. Tastes is lots of the pinot barrel and some lime. A bit of acidity helps, a little more barrel and some tartness. Different, but good.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
