2566,"2015-09-05",3.7,"September 18, 2014 - at Craft Clapham (Craft 100 fest); gravity cask. Black. Small frothy light brown head (4-). Smells like ... bourbon; blegh (get OVER this obsession with boozy sugar aka bourbon!) ... there is a hint of the wonderful, amazing, stupendous imperial stout base beer, but its just basically shat on by vanilla/booze/sugar/plasticine (bourbon) - meh (8- because other people seem to like that crap, thats what they were going for, and its probably NICE bourbon). Taste has better balance - yes, to bourbon, but the nutty/roasty/solid impy shines through more, so 8+ (restrained alcohol too) ... slick, a bit thin, surprisingly lively mouthfeel, finishes quick, with emerging fruit and heavy dark malt - solid enough, but the regular Bracia is so much better.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

2566,"2014-02-05",3.2,"From cask @ Borefts 2013. Been looking forward to this for a long time! One of my favorite beers on bourbon and cask. Has to be good. Looks casked with a really deep and dark brown near black body, and the head is what a casked head looks like, bubbly and quickly gone. Its surprisingly mellow on the nose. Some smoky nice hints with a little bit of both chocolate and tobacco. The flavor is a bit more present than the aroma. Thick and oily in the mouth with a near flat prickling little carbo level. Loaded with dark rich chocolate and a little bit of smoke. Also, the bourbon shines through much better than I thought based on the aroma. Evolves and grows in your mouth. Lasting woody chocolate boozy tail on this. Have to say, I had hoped for a little (much) bit more, but its still a fine one!
