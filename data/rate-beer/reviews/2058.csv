A big wallop of alcohol on the back end and lots of carbonation keep it from getting cloying. Very dry, only a hint of caramel sweetness.

2058,"2015-04-09",4.0,"On tap at the ""Lanc"" - tap fills the glass with a lightly hazed dark copper-red ale with a billowing 3 finger off white cap that laces well. Aroma is subtle when cold but pungent as it warms - a complex malt signature and light herbal tones. Character is sturdy, malty, silken delivery, - Flavor profile gives you a big whack in the teeth with complex maltiness then good balance - rich, nutty, bready, woodsy, minutely sweet then the long drying finish is clean, toasty and increasingly bitter with a great hop bite at the end - Wow , what a smooth drinker for such a big ale - I have no idea how his got branded as a bier de guard because this is the best Dopple Sticke Alt flavor I have tasted outside LTM and Beaus double altbiers I wish this was available all year.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
2058,"2015-04-07",3.6,"Im pretty sure this is the first of its style that Ive had. First impression leans on Belgium style rock candy sugar ale. Pours a dark teak with a lush cappuccino foam style cap. One of the prettier beers you will see, sustains its head & gives off lacing like a politician handing out tax breaks before an election. 

Note the highly tweaked carbonation. Note the snap & crackle coming out of the glass, you can almost hear it from across the table. Comes on malty, with more sugar on the tongue than a last chance dance at last call. Finish is herbal, peppery & slightly boozy. I dig the bite, not so hip to the candy sweetness, but again Im working blind with this style & appreciate this as an educational experience (esecislly at 8.5%). Great winter beer, even if Im drinking this in early April up here at the cabin on the lake.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
2058,"2015-04-04",3.2,"A dark brown pour with explosive head. A rich amber colour gives way to a full bodied flavour. The alcohol is not hidden here as it warms you up quickly.
