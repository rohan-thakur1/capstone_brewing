3169,"2016-09-02",3.4,"Nearly clear shade. No head. Elements of pear, apple and vanilla in the aroma. Quite sweet and tasty mid-palate, ending a bit less interesting. Not possessing the complexity of more premium sakes, but has much more drinkability.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"

3169,"2014-07-27",3.4,"Bottle (gift) consumed at home. Colour is somewhere between water and Sauvignon Blanc. Smell of plum, peach and violet. Taste is very sweet with only a slight bitter-sour kick at the end. A real honey vanilla aftertaste. Im no sake connoisseur by any means but this was very nice at the end of a long day.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

Some rice in there, along with straight alcohol. Full bodied with creamy. Warming finish, sugary sweet. Alright, but pretty basic.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

The taste is smooth, coconut, custard, eggy and warming alcohol. Light-medium body and still. Not complex, but smooth and easy drinking. Ok.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

3169,"2010-01-05",2.5,"A 0.5 l bottle from Kaufland, courtesy of Doggythedogy, thanks for sharing. It poured almost colorless body with weak thin legs. Alcoholic aroma, bit fruity in apple and raisins way, some wood and fine flowery note. Flavor is woody a bit as well, had that slight note of white wine, but without intensive flavor, all too watery body, which is on the other way normal for sakes Ive tried so far. Finish is short, not warming. I see some quality in this one although as I could recall I liked others maybe more.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"
3169,"2010-01-04",3.5,"0.5l bottle that weve found at the big Kaufland in Split. Tried it lukewarm. Poured a clear, still body, just ever so slightly touched by yellow, really really pale. The nose is atypical for a sake I guess, sweet raisins, nicely fruity. Of course, some underlying alcohol, noticable but not too bad. Typical ""watery"" mouthfeel for a sake, but soft and dry. Raisins again, fruity, slightly warming, some alcohol, but not much alcohol taste, which is a plus. I like it actually... dunno how genuine this is but its a nice try for something apparently not made in Japan.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"
