Very smooth mouthfeel, almost silky, to the point that it can almost be defined as sweet; there is a delicate fruitiness, and light flowery touch. Mild bitterness in the end; the alcohol is well hidden. Very good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

256,"2010-11-17",3.7,"Found this gem on my recent trip to Nagano. Just a hint of color, or it is just thick enough to  give a bit off haze that prevents it from being mineral water clear. (Cold) Almonds, honey, melon rind in the nose, light alcohol. A rather sweet sake, fruity, nectarines, woody, earthy, I like this stuff! Nice feel, lip smacking sticky but not cloyingly so. (Room temp) A milder scent, more almonds than fruit, koji and alcohol take a back seat. Koji more noticable in the flavor, umami. I prefer this at room temp. (Hot) More of the alcohol and koji in the nose, the fruit is subdued, almond scents follow. Rich, earthy, good body, the light sweetness is still there, that ""full"" mouthfeel is quite nice. On this cold rainy night, hits the spot.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"

Similar flavor, nice body, light and clean and easy drinking. The summer melon is the dominant note in this one. Little in the way of koji. A very enjoyable sake.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Aroma was quite crisp with notes of fruit, melon, wood, flowers and almost apricot like. Over the palate came a hint of light spicy notes with the fruity base, and some rice and smooth melon. Quite full boded with warming alcoholic texture. Warming melon and dry crisp finish.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"
