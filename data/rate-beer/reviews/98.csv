98,"2012-09-21",3.7,"My Bottom Line :  
Smoked peppers, coffee, chocolate and vanilla join in this sweet concoction nearly balanced out by hot capsaicin.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam touches the darkness.
-The smoked pepper character is reminiscent of some good smoked Hungarian paprika. Impossible to decipher which specific varieties were used.
-Even though the flavor profile is engaging, the mouthfeel was just too rich for me on that day. Loads of residual sugars...
-I like pepper heat being used to offset residual sugars instead of portentous hops. I wouldnt trade hops for pepper heat, but it made for a nice change of pace nonetheless.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
98,"2012-09-16",3.8,"On tap at the Dieu du Ciel 14th anniversary party, pours a dark brown / amber / near-black with almost no head. Aroma of mild spicy peppers at first and some mild cocoa  doesnt seem like itll be that spicy. Flavour begins mildly spicy and cocoa-prominent; the spiciness becomes more and more prominent the more you drink. Im usually weary of spiced stouts (or spiced beer in general), but this is fantastic. I could somehow drink loads of this, without the spiciness becoming too much or annoying. Excellent one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
98,"2012-02-08",3.4,"In short: A roasted stout with cocoa and a hot pepper finish.  Ok but I much prefer the regular version
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Black body topped by a small tan head
In long: Nose is very roasted, cocoa and light hot spiciness.  Taste seems more roasted and less vanilla than the regular Aphrodisiaque.  Although it might just be the lower vanilla presence that makes the beer feels more roasted.  Nice rich cocoa, roast, light coffee notes, chicory sensation.  The hot peppers are well integrated until the come back.  While you swallow the beer you can feel a hot spiciness but nothing too crazy.  But after swallowing there is that burning sensation on the come back that was a bit too much for me.  This is one of the best (less bad) hot-spiced stout/porter Ive had but I prefer the regular Aphrodisiaque by far.  I can see this one being better with some time on it, I had it uber-fresh the day of its official release at the pub and maybe the hot spiciness will soften up with time.  I enjoyed this beer graciously offered by the owner the day of the beer release, but I left immediately afterwards because the pub was too crowded again, too many people for me, to be honest I only like 65% of people, and only because I love water.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

98,"2011-12-01",3.8,"On tap at the Blind Tiger for their Dieu du Ciel event.  Pours a deep dark black with just the faintest wisps of dark tan head. Soft coffee, sweet vanilla on the nose.   Sweet vanilla and cocoa, light and sweet.  A small amount of chili heat start showing up slowly and steadily, never getting overbearing.  More of a memory of something formerly spicy.  Very nice addition.  Smooth chocolate, vanilla, and light heat on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
98,"2011-11-30",3.9,"Draft at Blind Tiger with Andrew, Streets, Mark, Ben and Kyle. Pours a deep blackish body with thin brown lacing. Aroma is spicy and grass hops. Mouthfeel starts out with a nice hop flavor and finishes with a great fine spicy pepper taste. Not overdominating like Sculpin Habanero, but refined enough to let the drinker enjoy the other flavors and textures.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
98,"2011-11-29",4.0,"[on tap at brewpub]
Complex aroma of chocolate and smoked peppers with some biscuits and toffee somehow coming through. Opaque black and thick, under a lasting, dense foam (on nitrogen?). Full, complex flavour that begins with a slightly vegetal smokiness quickly followed by sweet, milk chocolate and subtle, black pepper bite. Full body, moderate to low carbonation, smooth and velvety.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

98,"2011-11-02",3.7,"On tap at DDC.  Pours a jet black topped with a dense and creamy beige head.  Strong earthy and chocolatey aroma, some light vegetal notes also...kind of like a mole sauce.  Distinct pepper flavor up front in the taste is quickly overtaken by a wave of dark chocolate and a mild, pleasantly lingering heat.  Finishes dry and smoky, mescal comes to mind.  Velvety smooth on the palate, the carbonation lends body to the beer without impeding the flavors.  Quite nice, a great flavor combination.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Lanchester"

98,"2011-10-22",3.8,"Aroma: Heavy vanilla with hints of cocoa. Very rich and desserty.
Appearance: Dark brown with a thick, tan head.
Taste: Medium sweetness all the way through, with hints of bitterness at the finish.
Palate: Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, long finish.
Overall: Very drinkable beer, and the vanilla and chocolate do add something, but Im not blown away. It would be great with a variety of desserts.","Ohio, USA","pottygok"
