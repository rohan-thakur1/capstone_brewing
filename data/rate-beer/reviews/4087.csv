The aroma is very strongly barnyardy, this has perhaps the most pungent and defined barnyard aroma Ive ever encountered in a beer, it is pungent, bracing, and awesome. The beer is also smells a bit lemony and has some cheese rind character to it .

The flavor has some mildly bitter citrus rind, The beer is lightly tart, strikingly earthy and has a bit of saltiness. Its a very tasty beer but the flavor doesnt really match the pungency of the aroma.

The Lambic served here was most likely a young version.  The beer had some reddish notes to it, unlike the Gueuze, which was much more of a gold color.  The smell did not smell as sour as I had expected.  The reason I think it was young was that the acidity seemed a bit low; on the other hand it had a pronounced mustiness to it that was not unpleasant.  The beer was quite a bit smoother than the Gueuze, probably a combination of no carbonic acid and an overall lower acidity level.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
