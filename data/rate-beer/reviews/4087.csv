The aroma is very strongly barnyardy, this has perhaps the most pungent and defined barnyard aroma IÂ’ve ever encountered in a beer, it is pungent, bracing, and awesome. The beer is also smells a bit lemony and has some cheese rind character to it .

The flavor has some mildly bitter citrus rind, The beer is lightly tart, strikingly earthy and has a bit of saltiness. ItÂ’s a very tasty beer but the flavor doesnÂ’t really match the pungency of the aroma.

Fruity aroma of diesel, cloudberries and soil.
Fruity flavor with acidic tannins and a bitter, tart finish. This is the top of the league so to speak. From an unfortunately closed brewery.","Solna Stockholm, SWEDEN","DrBeer"
4087,"2003-11-04",4.0,"Sampled at the Oud Beersel cafÃ©.  This Lambic is served in the traditional manner, completely flat (no CO2 at all) from the tap.  The Lambic served here was most likely a young version.  The beer had some reddish notes to it, unlike the Gueuze, which was much more of a gold color.  The smell did not smell as sour as I had expected.  The reason I think it was young was that the acidity seemed a bit low; on the other hand it had a pronounced mustiness to it that was not unpleasant.  The beer was quite a bit smoother than the Gueuze, probably a combination of no carbonic acid and an overall lower acidity level.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
4087,"2003-09-29",2.8,"[Draught at Stockholm Beer Festival 2003] An unclear orange head with a small bubbly head. The aroma is sour and sweet with metal notes. The flavor is also sour and sweet with metal notes. It was not nearly as sour as I remember it from a visit to the brewery 1Â½ years ago (before I joined Ratebeer) - there it was gut-wrenching sour","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Golden with a head of soapbubbles.
Aroma from exhausts, really sour.
Oh so sour flavour!
Not really my kind of beer, but refreshing and interesting.","Billdal, SWEDEN","larsniclas"

Im sorry, I guess this is something Im supposed to like. But the aroma reminded me of garbage, and I guess that helped me really unliking the flavor as well. This was very, very far from what I like.","GÃ¶teborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
4087,"2003-04-28",4.0,"Sampled draught at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden.
My second beer at Akkurat's lambic festival (after a godly 14 y/o Eylenbosch Frambozen...). Poured deep golden and slightly hazy. Barnyardy aroma, but without the typical acidity usually associated with unblended lambic. The flavour is complex with notes of blue cheese and grass and it is surprisingly sweet and mild. Some saltiness in a finish domited by stale hop bitterness. Perhaps my one and only chance to sample this beer :-(
Ha, I was wrong :-) They had a second barrel of it. This seemed younger and was strikingly hoppy. Also it was more tart and with distinctive sharp mouthfeel and a really bitter finish.","TyresÃ¶, SWEDEN","omhper"
