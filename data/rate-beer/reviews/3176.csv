3176,"2017-03-28",1.9,"If you find a random sake listed as a ""house sake"" on almost every menu in almost every low range sushi place in NYC, its probably this one as its cheap and plentiful. Smell of almonds and a little bit of water. Flavor is similar. A little bit of sweetness and a lack there of other flavors.","Fair Lawn, New Jersey, USA","KoRoBeNiKi"
3176,"2017-01-28",3.3,"Pours light yellow. Flavors medium sweet medium alcohol, rice. Not to bad of a sake but the alcohol does somewhat overwhelm the sweet rice undertones.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","MrBeerFanatic"

3176,"2015-06-20",2.3,"Taste from a large bottle with friends. Floral and sweet and relatively light bodied. Moderate alcohol burn. A little bit of champagne on the back of the throat. This is only the second Sake Ive had but this is much better than the last one.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
3176,"2014-06-30",1.8,"Sampled at a restaurant eating sushi, served hot. Pours a clear water like super pale yellow. The aroma and flavor have booze, earthy rice, grape skins and more booze. I just dont think I will really get sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
3176,"2014-03-03",3.5,"of course at a chinese/japanese restaurant. Smooth and some rice falvors, very light and easy sipper. Not a bad sake. I really dont know mroe to say more, just that I enjoyed it.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"

Pours a almost completely clear water, water with a few drops of lemon juice basically .. . wet rice, light alcohol, bean skin, and peach skin .. . a fairly simple sake, only a slight burn which is impressive for the 16% tag, not too shabby for a Futshu .. . . im gonna get that damned squirrel!!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"

3176,"2010-07-29",2.7,"Bottle thanks to mar via bu11zeye. Pours with a clear, slightly green tinged body. Minimal legs. Aroma of alcohol, light fruit, gasoline, banana and soil. Taste is watery yet burning. A bit oily on the palate. Fruity and a slight hint of rotting garbage. Not exactly a quality sake, but it is a Futsu.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3176,"2010-07-23",2.3,"poured clear with a faint yellow tint, decent looking legs.  nose is honey, rice, vanilla, and light florals.  decent on the palate, flavor is florals up front, followed by vanilla, and rice.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"

3176,"2010-06-26",2.9,"This 1.8 Liter Milk Carton sake from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of medium sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a clear colored body. The mild aroma was of rice. The flat mouth feel was smooth at the start and mildly burning alcohol at the finish with a strong vinous aftertaste. The mild flavor contained notes of vinous alcohol. An OK sake just nothing special.  Interesting box.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3176,"2010-03-11",2.0,"Hot from Box: A typical futsu-shu, moderate acidity that balances it right around 110ºF and a burning rubbing alcohol finish in the tail. I would say this one is a little bit more tolerable that some of the American cubies, but its not far off. Hot or nothing.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3176,"2009-07-15",2.9,"1.5 Liters, $7, California Market / Koreatown, L.A. / room temperature / appearance of city tap water; aroma of vegetable and alcohol; flavor of watered down sweet liquor - notes of fruit and vegetable; easy to drink; just enough to be good considering the price.","Petaluma, California, USA","steview"
3176,"2009-03-11",3.0,"My new, favorite, American-brewed, cheap sake swill.  Goes extremely well with casual reading, Settlers of Cataan, and video games.  A clear sake, whose aroma displays a slight smokiness, a great dear of riceyness, and an unfortunate but slight chemical off-taste.  The taste is, well, flavorful, and thats about as much as I can expect for a budget  sake.  Has a sweeter side with peaches and pears, with a nicely weighted palate.  Easily my number one budget sake.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3176,"2009-02-25",1.3,"0.75L bottle, extreme pale yellow with greenish taints and a touch of haziness. Aroma  is probably of rice, strong alcohol and some cooked vegetables that sat in the fridge.
Alcoholic flavours with touches of sweetness, but overall more dry than sweet, watery texture. An overly alcoholic sake that feells diluted and bland.","Rishon Le Zion, ISRAEL","tomer"
3176,"2009-01-05",2.5,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2010 bottle - I have very little experience with sake, but tonight I drank this one alongside the Sho Chiku Bai classic sake that I had previously rated.  I know, theyre different styles of sake, but it gave me something to compare.  I tried the two sakes served both cold and warm.  The Sho Chiku Bai is very clear while the Ozeki has a slight yellow tint.  The Ozeki smells like ass.  Alright, not ass, but its some unpleasant combination of alcohol, vegetable, and something rancid.  Its a bit harsh on the palate and has a taste of rice and alcohol and that strange unpleasantness again that Id already smelled.  Its warming, but of course it is.  Its sake and has the high alcohol thats standard.  Theres no comparison though.  The mellow Sho Chiku Bai is far superior.  Ounce for ounce it was even cheaper at $9 for 750ml versus the $6 I paid for 375ml of this stuff.  3/2/4/2/7

Rerate at Ft Wayne tasting - ""bottled"" in a carton of all things - This is the same sake?  Odd.  This time it was considerably better than the small bottle I rated above.  Pours clear with good clarity and a clean, flowery aroma.  Flavor has some alcohol.  Its sweet and overall fairly good. 6/3/7/3/12.  Ill average the two ratings.  Bad bottle above, apparently.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
3176,"2009-01-02",2.8,"I had a glass of this at a Chinese restaurant. The body is slightly hazy, but mostly clear. The aroma was strongly vegetable with some booze. There was also some sweet peaches. The taste was harsh celery with an alcohol burn. Light rice in the finish.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
3176,"2009-01-01",2.8,"Bottle.  Pours a clear, light gold with a very light green tint.  Almost looks like tea.  Taste is of rice and alcohol.  Has a sugary sweetness to it.  Aroma is of rice, alcohol and sugar.  Reminds me of rubbing alcohol, but is not too much of a negative.  Has an oily texture.  To me, it smells like wine and drinks like water.  Not a bad substance to get drunk on as it is unoffensive and is rather inexpensive.","Lander, Wyoming, USA","scooterbub"
3176,"2008-10-27",2.2,"Bottle from BevMo. Pours like water. Sweet fruity aroma. Somewhat candyish. A little grainy with some alcohol. Somewhat sweet flavored with ample alcohol. Some rubbing alcohol qualities. Not too impressive.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
3176,"2008-09-28",2.7,"nearly clear with the slightest yellow tint. very sweet rice smell with some undetermined fruitiness and alcohol burn. the old sniffer was right... sticky palate with lots of soft sweet rice, mild florals and a mildly dry bitter finish. dirty alcohol burns before revealing an aftertaste that is purely sticky. medium to full bodied, oily texture and coating mouth feel. tingling from abv% at least clears off my tongue...","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"
3176,"2008-05-19",1.4,"i have only drunk sake once before this and i didnt like it too much, but this one was much worse. ive got a pretty diverse palette in food and drink, but this was too hard to appreciate or even choke down.. it tasted too sweet in the worst way, but also a strange bitter/sour, generally unpleasant flavour that makes you gag. not a great appearance, and a very light smel sort of like coconut water. i can drink cheap liquor straight but this is just bad. pretty cheap for alcohol/price though i guess","CANADA","fredthecat"
3176,"2008-02-24",2.8,"Sample from a Sake Flight at Fuji Jade Garden, State College, PA. Aroma tends salty and sweet. Clear pour. A certain coarseness to the alcohol. Heavy mineral profile.

3176,"2007-01-23",2.6,"I will be honest, I dont know much about sake.  What I do know comes from a friend of mine who likes to drink it. With that said, I honestly cant say that the aroma or flavor was too unappetising, it is about the same as the other cheap sakes Ive tried. Until Ive tried a really good one, I cant really say either way.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
3176,"2007-01-13",2.6,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2007 (At Haket, Göteborg) Tried it warm. Clear color, like water. Alcohol and warm butter scent, acetone and some fruits. Pear initially, then butter taste with warming alcohol. A bit watery mouthfeel. Some alcohol taste as well.","Mölndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
3176,"2006-11-18",1.8,"Didnt know that the local cheep swill shop had any sake, but I shouldve known that if they carried any, itd be something like this.  The pour is quite clear but thick, coating the sides of the glass.  The aroma is steaming white rice and alcohol.  Its hot and oily on the tongue, perhaps usable as a castle defense, pouring it over the battlements sides onto a hostile force.  Little flavor beyond the alcohol and rice, perhaps some pome.  Hot, peppery alcohol finish.  This must be the Ripple of sakes, something to drink for the high, not the taste.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

3176,"2005-12-30",2.7,"375ml bottle purchased for me by Japanese exchange students I hosted for the Christmas holiday.  Served at room temp.   Pours crystal clear.  Light fruity aroma.  Lightly sweet rice flavor.  A little alcohol burn, but very drinkable.","Orange Park, Florida, USA","yayforbeer"

3176,"2005-02-22",3.6,"The first time I tried this sake, it was served to me cold and I really didnt think much of it as cold it basically tastes like rubbing alcohol smells.  Warmed up is a different ballgame and is what my rating is based on.  Enjoyed with a nice sushi dinner warmed up on the stove.  Smells strongly of rice with a unique taste with hints of rice and sugar.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3176,"2005-02-03",2.7,"Pours clear with a grainy rice aroma and an alcohol nose.  Over ice, as per bottle suggestion, the flavor is malty rice with a warm alcohol-ness to it.  Palate is smooth and light.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

3176,"2003-12-31",2.5,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2004 (750ml bottle) Served hot. Floral aroma that gives the perception of something far greater than 16%. Vanilla and rubbing alcohol flavour - more complexity once this sake becomes more temperate. Average.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
3176,"2003-12-01",2.7,"UPDATED: SEP 13, 2007 Starts out with a light but strong alcohol flavor that has a slightly syrupy sugar flavor, that tastes like unrefined cane syrup.  The rice flavor grows and finishes with a medium acidic rice/alcohol flavor.  Very grainy, but quite tasty.  Strong.  Taken warm you get more of a true rice flavor, but you also get a hot alcohol burn.  Has a white appearance, but has some waves in it, glucose-like.  Aroma is a sharp moderately acetic grain.  Not very complex on palate or nose.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
