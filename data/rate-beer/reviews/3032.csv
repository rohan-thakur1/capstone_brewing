3032,"2017-02-25",4.5,"Bottle, 330ml. Pours dark, cloudy reddish-brown with a thin sheen of light tan head. Patchy lacing. Oak and vanilla to the front immediately on the nose, underneath which we have some rich, dark, slightly bitter molasses, liquorice, dried fruits, candied pineapple, dark chocolate, dark rum, allspice, cinnamon, cognac, honey, speyside whisky, very slight smoke and roasted malt. Rich sweetness but avoiding being sickly so far; loads going on but incredibly well balanced on the nose, and with very little overt booze despite the 13% ABV. Taste is sweeeeeeeeeet! Somewhat lighter than I expected with plenty of honey, vanilla and fruit as opposed to darker molasses-esque notes. Fair bit of chocolate, nuts, cinnamon, and more rum, cognac, and speyside whisky-esque flavours cutting through as well. Leads into a long, softly bitter finish with some light oak and roasted malt. SO well balanced and again booze is remarkably well hidden and theres no harsh burn, only subtle warmth. Not sickly at all despite sweetness. Body is full and texture is thick and sticky; little bit astringent but very pleasant drinking overall. Obviously no carb. This is some remarkable stuff and gets basically everything about being a barley wine right!","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

Mon verre est à moitié fini et moi je le suis aux trois quarts. Une bière bien ténébreuse, presque noire et sans mousse. Japproche timidement mon nez de ce verre lourd (car oui, mon verre est particulièrement lourd) et je reçois en plein visage un tsunami de bourbon, de caramel, de dattes fraîches, de sucre de canne et dun alcool brun. Cest puissant; à la fois grossier et raffiné. Un coup de poing sur la gueule qui me fait voir un firmament détoiles toutes différentes les unes des autres, chacune ponctuant à sa façon cette infinie voûte céleste devant laquelle je magenouille, sonné et contemplatif. Je reprends mes esprits et dirige cette fois mon verre à mes lèvres. Je suis à nouveau la victime dun brutal assaut. Ce liquide huileux et collant me réchauffe tout le corps dun seul trait. Les saveurs mapparaissant moins complexes que les arômes sont dominées par le bourbon et le caramel. Je suis convaincu que la bière pourrait facilement passer pour un spiritueux suite à une gorgée à laveugle dun verre laissé une heure sur le coin dune table.

3032,"2016-01-03",3.5,"This was poured into a mini snifter.
The appearance was a dark brown color with no head nor lacing.
However, the aroma took up the sword and cut into toffee, sticky caramel malts, light tobacco, subtle vanilla, and cocoa. 
The taste represented the aroma very well being sticky sweet with a thorough sticky caramel aftertaste, cloying, yeah, maybe somewhat. Subtle sweet vanilla finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a great sipping quality about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the stickiness to build even further.
Overall, wish I could have found a date, I know Barleywines can be aged, but Im not quite sure about this one. Flavor and aromas are definitely there, Im just thinking carbonation kind of died off in this one, more carbonation probably could have helped being less cloying.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3032,"2015-03-15",3.7,"Pours a very deep copper body with a very small, tan head that doesnt stick to the glass and that disappears almost completely. The aroma is sweet, malty, hoppy, vinous, lovely and intense! I get notes of dark dried fruits, overripe fruits, plums, caramel, hops and alcohol. Very strong fruity flavour of both dark dried fruits and overripe fruits. Its a very alcoholic brew, both in the good vinous, bourbon barrel, vanilla sense, but unfortunately also in a not-so-pleasant sense: I find the alcohol far too intrusive and overpowering, and it really decreases the drinkability of this one. It is of course meant to be a slow sipper, but this is so alcoholic that I spent the good part of the evening finishing it. Other flavour components include sweet caramel, chocolate and faint liquorice. Its full-bodied and oily with a very soft carbonation. Of course a very good one, but I must admit that I was slightly disappointed, I had assumed that this would hit my top 10 list.

Bourbon vanilla melds into dried Medjool dates, as alcohol warmth and milk chocolate finish this sumptuous sipper

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the hazy mahogany.
-Carbonation is low but just prickly enough to make the residual sugars never feel limp.
-This is not the most complex Barley Wine out there, but it sure is luxurious and satisfying.
-The chocolatey undertones are wonderful with the raisiny fruitiness and bourbon.
-Id like to try this next to DDCiels Solstice dHiver Bourbon next time. Kindred spirits, Im sure.

Aftertaste is very sweet, mellow and well-rounded with some chocolate notes, a little earth and bourbon touch at the end. Overall, a very nice and rich barley wine with hints of an old ale, but the richness is definitely there - so are the flavours, and the bourbon adds a nice complexity as well. Odd to sample a norweigian beer here in spain, but it tastes great!

The aroma has too much alcohol stinging in the nose, with dried fruits, maltyness, caramel and something reminiscent of oxidation. Full body, warming and quite sweetish. Lasting finish with lots of dried fruits and roasted malts. Nice. 130323","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3032,"2013-03-16",4.2,"Bottle @ Lervig, Stavanger. Pours a deep brown body with a small light khaki head. Nose is sweet raisiny bourbon flavors with wood and deep caramel. Very smooth. Licorice, deep grainy caramel tones, bourbon, hints of dry whisky and tar. Mild carbonation, full body. Extremely bourbonated but sooo good. One of the best big beers from Lervig I've ever tasted.

3032,"2013-03-12",4.1,"Finally a place where I can find some decent beer in this godforsaken town(read:haugesund) The bottle is very cold as its stored in the fridge. Pour is close to black with basically no head. A small film of tannish film is evident when giving it a swirl. Even tho its really cold the hefty aroma of bourbon is unmistakeable. There is also loads of tar and liquorice here. Dark dried fruits, dates and raisins. The taste has, ofcourse, tonnes of bourbon. Its alcohol content is evident almost only from the warming effect it has. Loads of caramelized malts make for a sturdy backbone, even tho its heavily subdued by the bourbon, the mild roastyness and the dark liquorice. The body is full and its slick to oily on the palate. Awesome stuff.","Hauglandshella, NORWAY","ej"

3032,"2013-02-27",3.8,"Shared bottle at Cardinal. Pours much darker than the 10% version, small head. Aroma of thick sticky sweet malts, wood and bourbon. Oily mouthfeel. Taste is moderate to heavy sweet malty, light roasted caramel, lingering caramel sauce at the finish. Splendid beer.","Sandnes, NORWAY","gunnar"
3032,"2013-02-26",3.9,"Fra flaske på Cardinaltreff feb-13: kom rett etter 10%-utgaven. Mye mørkere enn denne, og mer sviskeplommer i smaken. lite skum, men masse smak! Mike sier at den kan lagres i minst 5 år, så her må det gjøres et strategisk innkjøp. Eminente saker.","Stavanger, NORWAY","Holmen1"
3032,"2013-02-26",3.9,"Shared 33 cl bottle at Cardinal. Misty deep mahogany colored body with an off-white rim. Heavy dried figs, raisins, maple surup, barrel and bourbon notes on the nose. Salty, pungent dried fruits and pleasant sweet flavors. Smooth to drink. Long finish.","Mosterøy, NORWAY","abemorsten"
3032,"2013-02-26",4.3,"Shared bottle @ Cardinal. Deep brown in color with a small tanned head. Strong aromas of vanilla, oak and dark dried fruits. Rich flavors of raisins, oak and vanilla. Really smooth and velvety. One of the best barley wines Ive tried out so far! It would be really interesting to try this one out after another year or two!","Stavanger, NORWAY","Alexus"
3032,"2013-02-25",3.7,"330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Sampled side-by-side with the 10% version. Hazy dark brown colour, much darker than the 10%. Minimal head. Strong  aroma of oak, bourbon and vanilla. Low carbonation. Intense flavour of oak, bourbon and vanilla, a bit ""raw"" in its character yet, will probably improve further with age.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
3032,"2013-02-05",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2013 (Bottle) Pours dark brown (almost black) with a creamy, nougat coloured head. The aroma holds wood/bourbon up front with notes of warming alcohol, toffee, vanilla, melted butter, some coconut and hints of dill. Deep malty undertones of roasted dark bread, cookies, caramel, soft cocoa and milk chocolate. Some brown sugar notes. Just a whisper of leafy hops and  prune-ish dark fruits. Round, fancy and mega yummy nose. The flavour is medium sweet and near medium bitter with a touch of acidic notes from roast and hops. Balanced (but aggressive) oak, deep malt, balanced hops. Complex, yet dangerously easy to drink. The mouthfeel is round and velvety alongside a light stickiness. Soft carbonation. Malt and bourbon balance is perfect on the finish. Near full bodied.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"
