637,"2016-03-12",3.9,"Another Mikkeller stout, this time a hybrid between milk stout and oatmeal stout. Thin but lacing, pale greyish beige, stable head over a blackish beer with mahogany edges. Lovely stout aroma of cappuccino, wet leather, strong bayleaf, coffee cream, dried chili peppers though these have not been applied here, fondant chocolate, salmiak, beef broth, candied fig, teriyaki, cigar ashes, soggy brown bread, dried banana, toffee, vanilla, mocha ice cream, dried tree leaves, earthy turnip. Restrained but effective candied sweetness in the onset, dry figs, some subdued banana and dried berries paired with underlying blackberry sourish and beefy umami accents, soft carbo perfectly fit for the style, very creamy mouthfeel (oats!) achieved by sweet caramelly and nutty malts turning very gently toasted bitter, mouth-filling, a little bit soapy, very smooth and oily; chocolatey malt factor comes in with a coffeeish bitterness to it, but neither of them is exaggerated and they both remain friendly in relation to the milky creaminess. Finish is a continuation of this layered, pleasantly thick maltiness, bittersweet, whilst adding a dash of deeply peppery, leafy hop bitterness further balancing out the chocolate and caramel sweetness; roasted, deeply black coffee-like bitterness lingers for a long time after that. Alcohol goes by unnoticed apart from a faint glow in the back. Well crafted, not overly complex but balanced oatmeal stout with undeniable milk stout features; I cannot help but wonder what this adds to Mikkellers already vast range of beers, but I certainly enjoyed it. The flavor in its purest sense is mostly bittersweet plus umami, so you know what to expect...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
