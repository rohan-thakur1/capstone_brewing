Aroma some light caramel, slight cherries. tastes bitter hops, some cherry fruit depth otherwise, not much rooibus coming through. some wheat huskiness, but this seems too hoppy for the category, more like a pale ale with some wheat in it.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
49,"2017-02-14",3.5,"Can @ Tap 25. Cloudy amber beer with a soapy white head. Super tropical beer, particularly on the nose. A lot of pineapple, kiwi, and mango. Theres a nice sweet orange note to it as well. Has a very pronounced tea character to it. Some bitter grass, tea, and citrus peel. Has a fair amount of sweet bread and caramel malts to it as well. Without the crazy tropical tea notes, not sure this would be that enjoyable of a beer. But as it stands, this is pretty nice.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

This is one of those cans that I picked up while on travel, and was excited to bring back to share, and then a week later, it showed up in introductory distribution. Oh well, doesnt change how good the beer is. A thick and bright copper orange color with a big soap bubble head. A wonderful juicy hop aroma. Mosaic on very fine display here. Juicy orange like tea flavors, with a constant floral, other mixed fruit, soft spice, and pleasant malt finish. In no way does the flavor suggest wheat beer for me. Cool, juicy, and delicious. Love this beer.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

I have never had rooibus tea before but Im guessing that its helping with the bitterness level here.

Clean on the palate, with a fruit-forward driven palate. More of the fall fruits. Clean and bitter finish, a bit too bitter actually.

49,"2016-10-16",3.7,"16 oz can @c Belmont Party Supply / Dayton OH --- Aroma of malt and semi-sweet citrus. Hazy medium-dark amber color, off-white head that stays at three-fingers, lace bands. Taste is a combination of malt and unsweetened tea that rolls through medium fizz to a finish that moves to more and more sweet fruit as the finish lingers. Neither the color, nor the taste suggest much wheat. An interesting brew that I could drink regularly.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"
49,"2016-09-29",3.8,"Aroma - has a slight sweet fruit nature. It took me forever to put my finger on it, buts almost like the pears in a fruit cocktail. Slight peach, some floral notes as well. It initially had a high metallic/smell of electric, but as it breathed - it totally disappeared.
Appearance - the body is a honeyed amber color, cloudy, with good nucleation. The head is off-white and 2+"", and is rocky with tight foam, settles very slowly.
Taste - has a nice swanky mix of resin, citrus, and floral hops. The wheat malt is placed deceptively below. There is also a slight initial metallic element, its not enough to take away, but it is there. As the beer breathes it disappears.
Palate - medium body, average carbonation, and has an abrupt touch of bitterness.

Interesting composite!","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

49,"2016-09-18",4.1,"Pours a copper color with a very foam white head. Aroma is juicy citrus and floral hops with a strong herbal presence that must be the rooibos tea - I admit I dont really know what rooibos tea smells or tastes.

49,"2016-09-04",4.0,"Pint can from Plumpjack. Amazeballz appearance, stunning deep clear amber with a billowing white head leaving thick lacing. Aroma is sweet wheat malts, caramel sugar, honey, mango, blueberry, and of course a substantial tea note. Flavor starts with mildly sweetened herbal tea and caramel, then citrusy hops on the finish. Medium bodied, silky smooth feel. A unique and delicious beer in the wheat ale style.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
49,"2016-09-02",3.5,"Bottle: Pour is murky gold, with a modest , white bubbled head into this glasss. It retains poorly - with sticky lacing presence here. I suppose for starters - it should be said that its fun to have a decent wheat ale on shelves - theyre so few and far between and it is summer. The mosaic hops are dominant here - jackfruit and mango, with stone fruit presence. The rooibos takes a back seat - but its present - Its one of those things that I wouldnt have been able to guess if I were doing a blind experience. The flavor profile is overly bittering by my estimation - it has a sharpness that dominates initially. Tropical notes and herbal understones - Juicyfruit , resinous, piney notes mesh with the bready malt and earthy character here. It might start off a little harsh but it does work its way to something a bit more subdued at the end.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
49,"2016-09-02",4.2,"16 ounce can into pint glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy deep orange/light copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, papaya, berry, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, light pepper/pine, light caramel/nuttiness, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright/juicy citrus/tropical hops, herbal tea, and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, papaya, berry, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, light caramel/nuttiness, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/herbal/spicy/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, papaya, berry, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, toasted bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops, herbal tea, and moderate bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, with slight lingering hop/tea astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, sticky/resinous, and fairly grainy/bready balance mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.4%. Overall this is an outstanding hoppy wheat ale. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops, herbal tea, and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

49,"2016-08-24",3.3,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2016 Pint can split with Boo; from Louisville Beer Store. Can says ""Brewed and Packaged by Against the Grain,"" which I doubt because it was reasonably priced. Anywho... Aroma: Boo noted that this has quite the raspberry thing going on, and I think thats a good call; some herbal tea notes and light caramel besides. Certainly doesnt have the profile of your typical wheat ale. Appearance: Slightly hazy copper pour with healthy carbonation holding up a foamy off-white head that settles into a thin skin. Flavor: Raspberry and caramel up front with some butterscotch; more herbal and bitter towards the finish, which is mostly dry. Palate: Full body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: Enough interesting things going on here to make this somewhat enjoyble; the slightly prominent butterscotch-like notes stop me from rating this higher.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

Maybe even a hint of molasses and pine. The flavor is the same. Lots of burnt caramel, blueberry pie, strong tea leaves, orange and some peach. Lots of malt character here that balances the tea nicely. Mosaic was a good choice for this beer as it provides a lot of fruitiness. The bitterness is herbal, but pretty low to medium. No astringency. I actually enjoyed this one a lot despite itself.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
49,"2016-08-01",4.1,"Pours a rich reddish amber, nice robust head. Rooibos comes out cleanly on the nose as well as grassy and floral notes, juicy passion fruit, bit of lemongrass.

There is also a smooth earthy and almost spicy bitterness that makes it even more interesting. Mouthfeel is watery with a light body and low carbonation. Very easy drinking because of the mouthfeel and body. The flavors, even though they are somewhat contrasting, are original and interesting and ultimately work well together.
