3154,"2017-02-26",4.1,"750 ml bottle shared by a friend, thanks Mike! Hazy golden orange with off-white head. Aromas of candied peaches, peach jelly rings. Tastes of tart acidic notes, tart peaches, stone fruit. Light body with a dry finish. Tasty enough with a great aroma but not very complex.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"

3154,"2016-11-10",3.7,"Draught at the brewpub. Clear pale golden/yellow beer with a decent offwhite head. Sourish peach aroma, citrus, funky notes, a bit floral. Sourish peach flavor, funky, grapes, citrus notes. Good but slightly too sweet.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
3154,"2016-06-18",5.0,"By far the best of their bunch of the sour line up. Peach aroma was amazing but not as big as the blueberry, the wine and lacto came out with the fruit. The taste was so well balanced from the funky barrel wine and tart and finishes with dried peach fruit. Loved it.","San Diego, California, USA","chargerfanjess"
3154,"2016-05-29",3.7,"Bottle. Amber beer with a low whitish head. Peach and sour aroma with earth. Peach and earthy flavor with sourness. Medium bodied. Sourness and peach lingers with earth.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
3154,"2016-03-21",4.0,"Bottle from Corti Brothers. Pours golden with a few bubbles that popped and disappeared. There is an interesting funky peach aroma and an equally funky but smooth sourish peach flavor.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
3154,"2016-03-21",3.9,"Bottle shared by Marcus. Pours hazy gold with a few bubbles. Nice fresh peach aroma. Med body or so. Flavor is a somewhat ""candy"", mildly, mildly sour peach. Good drink.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

3154,"2016-02-11",3.8,"750ml bottle acquired from Binnys South Loop (Chicago, IL). An exciting new find from Oceanside. Pours a hazy glowing orange amber hue, a touch darker and dulled into the middle but healthy sunfire peach glow as we move out and hit the edges. Frothy whitish head atop stays as a mellow film, thicker big bubbly layer that sits atop and laces well enough. Aromas are peachy and nectar driven, tart and fruity, delicious apricot and peach elements are fruity, dry, and god like nectar. Rich, fruity, pulpy without being acidic or too lactic driven. Gentle yogurty appeal, subtle earth and citrus. So much depth and potency here. Initial is fruity, dry, and tart. A lot of fleshy peach nectar but not sweet, that distinct dry and pitty appeal balanced well. Gentle to middling tart sour appeal, some gentle lactic life, a bit flabby on the carbonation front. Mellow yogurt, earth, tart lemony and subtle orange appeal. A healthy peach addition drives the ship here. A bit more sour, dry as we round the corner. Subtle yogurt, earth, lactic presence. An oddity here, the nose is just beyond approach, rich and alluring and a winner through and through. The beer itself is nectar driven, lots of fruit presence but lacking as a sour overall in that regard. Light enough, but lacking some fizzy carbonic depth to add that layer were all looking for. A fruit driven nose that really offers a lot behind a mellow but glowing pretty pour. I can see the beer itself moving people in a lot of ways. For me, the flavors are on but the beer itself ends up a bit flabby and under soured for me. That said, the peach nectar is rich, genuine, and may develop more as they lock in. Certainly something to watch as they put out more but also no slouch as a beer as it is.. Just a bit out of my expected wheelhouse. Nice. Lush nose. The best Oceanside beer Ive had thus far and showing signs for potential and growth, no doubt","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3154,"2016-02-10",3.5,"A more pronounced farmhouse character in this than the blueberry - though complexity and quality is lower than the inflated score indicates. An ok sour beer.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3154,"2016-01-19",3.7,"Shared 750 ml. bottle poured to snifters, showing a cloudy, orangey gold color, with a modest layer of soft white head foam that reduced fairly rapidly to light film, a bubbly ring and spots of lacing. The nose was expressive peach, and sour candy/pixy stix sweetness. Light to medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste was sweet, peachy, yet dry & sour, with a citrusy & rind-like astringency. Liked it, a big peach fan, but didnt detect much in the way of yeasty funk across the board.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
3154,"2016-01-11",3.8,"Healthy pour at the Side Project Smooth release bottle share. The nose is amazing So much fruit, peaches, apricots. Touch of natural fruity sour. Almost reminds me of Peche-n-brett, which i regard as the best nose on a fruited wild. Taste though drops off. Really isnt much sour. bit of fruit, but not nearly as much as the nose. The funk really picks up here, lots of barnyard, oak, slight metallic. Its a pretty good beer, but the taste is such a drop off from the nose it really leaves you longing for more.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3154,"2016-01-09",5.0,"Have had lambics and fruit lambics for years. Had this in blueberry and then this the peach. Very consistent with the style as with the blueberry. Same base beer I guess. Taste tart and funky sour fought and breads sour as a sour Belgian is. Oaky and funky. Peaches danced around all over. Very peachy but not set peach but more of a nose and olfactory peach. The sour dominated and peach added the perfect balance. Orange and cloudy champagne like carbonation with no head. As mentioned before the balance of fruits and tarts were phenomenal.","","Ventanas83"
3154,"2016-01-02",4.9,"New Years bottle 750 ml wax top. Light orange pour bubbly and peachy musty grape wine like aroma. Smelled very well aged and balanced from wine like to lambic tart like and peaches of course. Mainly to art and cellar like with background of peaches. Most peaches came through the nose on finish.","St Louis, Missouri, USA","CousinBrenden"
3154,"2015-12-29",3.8,"750ml bottle with some poor marketing, cringed when my buddy picked it up off the shelf for 17.99 though it is actualy a great beer still overpriced. It is good though, smells like a watermelon jolly rancher and tastes like a peach jolly rancher meets warhead. Sweet and candylike but pleasant.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3154,"2015-12-28",4.5,"Dark orange pour no head champagne carbonation. Overwhelming peach aroma. Tart and sour and wine taste with backbone and aftertaste of peaches.","","Autonetics1969"
3154,"2015-12-26",4.5,"Champagne bottle and coincidentally a champagne like pour very effervescent. Peach nose from a dark orange color brew. Very tart and nice wine like flavors. Peach all through the experience. Very Chardonnay sauv blanc finish.","Tustin, California, USA","Bonnie628"
3154,"2015-12-21",4.8,"750 bottle yellow wax top funky 60s label. Aroma of peach and light cedar and some Belgian yeast funkiness. Flavor initially sour and tart with backbone of peach and basement oak and funk. Very dry on palate and peaches linger on through dry finish.","Oceanside, California, USA","Broncowaldon"
3154,"2015-11-30",4.8,"Bottle share with some San Diego RBers. 750 bottle wax top that was yellow and groovy label. Orange color, decent peach and wine aroma. Initial tartness on palate with peach aftertaste. Not super strong on peach however really nicely balanced between fruit funk and tartness.","Nevada, USA","mel4vegas"
