1611,"2015-07-29",3.1,"Trader Joes Junmai Ginjo Premium Saki.

Pours slightly tinted clear. Aroma of rice, glue, and fruit. Reminds of me rice pudding aroma, without the spice. Taste is mellow. Light glue, some pear, and rice. Dry... not bad for a cheap saki!","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
1611,"2014-03-15",3.2,"Tallahassee, Fl - Trader Joes - labeled as Trader Joe-sans Junmai Ginjo Sake. Slightly darker than clear, still pour. Aroma has some light boiled rice accents, a brief floral hint. Flavor is mellow with a slight alcohol burn, picking up some light grassy notes, a touch of ripening vegetables. Smooth, crisp mouthfeel. After a hearty ""straight"" sample, used the rest of the bottle to make Saké bloody marys. - a treat we discovered at the beach last week.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1611,"2013-08-11",3.5,"Under the Trader Joes label. Great aroma, peach, pepper, and alcohol. Clear of course. Good palate. A good, inexpensive sake.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1611,"2013-06-29",3.7,"Bottle, as Trader Joes Junmai Ginjo Premium. Courtesy of BDR. Clear. Light yeast and fruit aroma. Big pear and fruity flavor. Some floral notes as it opens up. Very solid, and considering the price, an outstanding bargain.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1611,"2012-11-20",3.0,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours tinted white with a stong fermented rice aroma. The flavor is passable, and quite typical of sake, but a bit more starchy than usual.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1611,"2012-11-04",3.2,"Bottle from World Market. Pours perry color. Aroma is moderate fusil oil. With a little green melon. Near medium body. Flavor is rice, green melon and a hint of fusil oil. Actually much more palatable than many cheap sakes.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1611,"2011-09-01",3.8,"Trader Joe-sans.  Almost crystal clear.  Aroma is sweet with rice, alcohol and light fruit.  Tastes light and sweet at first, but ends more dry and spicy.  Slightly grainy but quite smooth.  Great for the price of $9.99.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"
1611,"2011-02-04",3.6,"720 mL bottle as Trader Joe-sans Junmai Ginjo Premium Sake.  Served chilled, warming over the course of a couple hours.  Pours clear with a faint golden tinge.  Alcoholic aroma with a sweet vanilla frosting aroma and hints of banana and vinegar tone.  In the flavor, the ""frosting"" definitely seems more like brown sugar and a bit of vanilla extract, with some candied dark fruit and the banana hints.  Slightly sweet with the alcohol pronounced but still smooth.  Finish leaves just a little of the vanilla and candied fruit notes.  My first time trying sake--that is, the first time I have a clear memory of.  Takes a bit of time to get used to, but this certainly seems like a decent place to have started.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
1611,"2010-03-29",3.2,"Bottle. Pours clear and still, like water. Lightly sweet aroma, some almost doughy rice notes and a hint of pear. The flavor brings a more well rounded pear like sweetness, a light candy like sweetness, and just a light boozy burn. Decent.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
1611,"2010-03-20",4.2,"Bottle at Jimmy Wans (Fox Chapel). Pours an almost crystal clear, very water like. Aroma is sweet and a subtle note of fruit. Flavor profile is more of the same, fruit note is plum and peach, they become a little more apparent as it warms. No real alcohol burn to speak of. Very smooth and non-offending sake. Nicely done !","Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA","sirpsycho"
1611,"2010-01-18",4.0,"This brew has a few small hints of bitter, but if served properly chilled, they mellow out.  Great hints of melon, hints of green apple, some sort of high-pitched floral nose mixed with slight scotch, especially when room temperature.  Pretty tasty with a frozen berry or apricot!  Also with heavier foods, perhaps some spice.  I think the current averaged rating is kinda low - this is a 4 out of 5 sake - very reasonable and tasty, but keeping in mind that great sake is indeed 20% better - though waaay more expensive!  

Bravo Trader-Joe-San!  A great bargain on a quality product.","California, USA","Jim_teacher"
1611,"2009-03-10",3.4,"Labeled as ""Trader Joe-sans Selected Sake from Japan Junmai Gingo"". Drank at 55*F. Pours clear and hued like water. Legs are minimal. Aroma is a bit earthy, with pear and peach notes, cotton candi, koji, banana and fusel alcohol. Overall sweet. Taste is sweet with koji, a bit nutty. Hints of vanilla and fruit. Alcohol is reigned in MUCH better than I expected for something of this price and quality. A bit of marzipan on the finish. Clean. A bit thing on the mouth. Light and refreshing. Well hidden alcohol, good balance and really, a very good cheap sake.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1611,"2008-10-05",2.8,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2008 Blue bottle from TJs. Clear in color. Somewhat sweet candyish aroma. Some alcohol. Slightly sweet in flavor with some graininess. A bit of alcohol is noticeable. Pretty easy to drink though.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
1611,"2008-06-28",3.7,"Drank cold.  Poured as clear as water with no head.  The aroma has a mild sweetness with notes of earthy pear. The aroma is very clean with just a touch of sweet fruit but overall dry.  It is warming but smooth with no real alcohol taste.  Upon warming the fruit came out more.  Also some light rice notes in the aroma and flavor.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1611,"2008-05-19",2.0,"Appearance: clear, light/pale yellow body.

Aroma: boozy and sharp with a dirty grain smell.

Taste:  Lacking in depth and dominated by sugary booze flavors. Touches of coconut.

Palate: Sharp! Burning, boozy.

Drinkability: low. 

This is not a pleasurable sake even at its low price.  One dimensional, and its a bad dimension at that.","Wisconsin, USA","Bottman"
1611,"2007-11-30",3.5,"750 ml bottle from TJs Downers Grove. Well, Im not going to be shy about new ways to be drinkin! Into my FoBAB sampler glass it goes. So clear as vodka, but without the light distortion of alcohol swirling around. Dont know how this is supposed to smell, but this is very nice. Light plum and a bit floral barely masks a nose of alcohol. First sip is hard to even feel in your mouth, it instantly assumes body temperature. The more Ill call it chrysanthemum, but to me its just a light flowery taste. Again a touch of fruit, But each sip manages to start out nearly insubstantial before infusing my mouth with its delicate flavor and leaving an bit of alcohol burn in its wake. This is fascinating stuff. Cmon, RBans; give sake a try, How can something from Trader Joes only have 6 ratings!?","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
1611,"2007-01-29",2.4,"Clear of color from the 750 ml botte.  Very alcohol in flavor with some rice undertones.  Aromas were almost the same.  Not bad.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"

1611,"2006-12-10",2.8,"Blue bottle from Trader Joes:  Aroma of rice, alcohol, and some very light fruit notes.  Appearance is clear as water or vodka with no discernible head or anything,  Taste is light with rice and the alcohol coming to the forefront.  Other flavors are white wine and a slight stinging to it.  Palate is light and very alcoholic.  Overall, Its a smooth drinking sake.  Very good with the Sushi that I just bought.  Decent","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","demitriustown"
1611,"2006-12-09",3.0,"Bottle from Trader Joes; Nose of grainy rice and light alcohol. Absolutely transparent with no bubbles or head; different from any bee,r wine, scotch, or otherwise Ive had in my 56 years; flavor is something like a gin, but with another light spicy flavor replacing the juniper berries; maybe someday Ill be good at judging sakes. i am going to rate it kind of near other like sakes.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
1611,"2006-01-29",3.0,"Pours clear and oily like vodka.  Smells and tastes of steamed rice.  Finish of alcohol burn.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
1611,"2006-01-22",3.4,"Sampled at the Milwaukee YEHa!05 courtesy of hezron: Pours with a still, very clear, almost water-like appearance with good viscosity.  Sweet complex, floral ricey aroma has some alcoholic notes.  Body has a light floral flavor with a touch of sugary sweetness and vanilla with a warming alcoholic finish.  A decent sake.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

1611,"2005-12-20",3.6,"Aromas of white chocolate, vanilla and a hint of wood.  Very soft and nice.  Clear in color with nice legs that seemed really thick.

The flavor is very earthy, not much umami and a bit much alcohol. Finishes clean but dry. An average Junmai Ginjo that is well worth the $13.50 for a 720mL bottle.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
