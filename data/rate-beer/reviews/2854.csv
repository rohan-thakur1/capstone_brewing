Piwo barwy ciemnobrązowej z całą masą rubinowych refleksów, nieprzejrzyste.
Piana beżowa, betonowa, drobna, zbita, pozostawia cudowny lacing na szkle, po prostu piana idealna.
Czuć, że mamy do czynienia z potężnym piwem, a zaczynając od początku, na pierwszy plan wysuwają się ciemne owoce, jeżyny oraz wiśnie, czereśnie, czerwone porzeczki, przejrzałe winogrona, rodzynki, aromat przypomina bardzo dobre wino lub szampan. Następnie dochodzi przypalony karmel wraz z przyprawami, gdzieniegdzie manifestują swoją obecność nuty rustykalne(siano), a także przypalony spód od ciasta, może lekka paloność.
W smaku jest zdecydowanie wytrawne, wysycenie wysokie(ale nie przesadzone), są tutaj winne posmaki mieszając się z śliwkami, wiśniami czereśniami, przejrzałymi winogronami, później dochodzą przyprawy, leciutki karmel.
Finisz pozostaje w tonie winnym, a później ustępuje subtelnej ziołowości.
Trappistes Rochefort 10 jest genialnym i wielowymiarowym quadruplem, przede wszystkim świetnie zharmonizowanym w aromacie i smaku, wszystko współgra ze sobą tworzą genialne piwo.
Pomimo dość sporego alkoholowego ""bagażu"" nie czuć go nawet krzty(nawet nie rozgrzewa w przełyk, coś niezwykłego), widać że w Belgi opanowali to do perfekcji. Piwo zdecydowanie do dłuższej degustacji i powolnego sączenia.

2854,"2017-01-23",4.0,"We are sampling this just after trying St. Bernardus 12 for the first time last night and this one unfortunately pales somewhat in comparison. The first thing that you notice when smelling and tasting is the strong alcohol content that is not disguised at all. It pours with a nice frothy tan head and a dark red brown color in the body. While the overall flavor is the typical sweet molassesy / caramelly flavor typical of most Belgians, the high alcohol content dominates every sip and masks some of the most subtle flavors that might otherwise emerge. Still it is an excellent beer compared to most any other Belgian, but despite a higher overall rating for this, I think the St Bernardus 12 was a bit better as it hid the alcohol much better.

Very drinkable for the ABV, tastes lightly of dark fruit and everything else in the aroma. Great aftertaste, kinda hot, goes away quickly. The palate is surprisingly carbonated, hence the head that does not disappear. Extra carbonation works well here and it is still very smooth.

Pours a dark brown color with a fluffy, fizzy, two finger sized head.

Fantastic aromas of ripe sour cherries among rock sugar and roasted malts, very intense on the nose. Almost a little boozy, but amazingly well integrated into the decadent sweet aromas, balanced by old wood and toasted walnut shell. 

Has a very lively, bubbly carbonation, which makes the beers heavy body unfold in a lighter manner on the tongue, also washing away its boozy peak, which is recognizable for just a split second, while leaving with a long lasting warmth down the throat. 

Cherries from the nose are amongst the flavors from the very beginning, entangled into toffee, licorice, dried wood bark and autumn leaves. Malts have a toasty richness in this, which is heavy on the tongue, opening up the palate perfectly to the sweeter flavors, and makes it possible to integrate its warm boozy note so perfectly well. Nuttiness mingles into the warming alcohol, producing a cola sweetness, calmed by old earth and toasty malts, while finishing with a bubbly mineralic tone and dried plums. 

I am blown away by this one, this tastes perfect. Love the dried, sugared, alcohol soaked cherry note, which blends into roasted, rich malts. All flavors are intense and well pronounced at the same time, creating an awesome balance, making it possible for the different components to pack such a huge punch.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2854,"2016-04-10",4.6,"Pours very dark brown from the bottle. The creamy tan crown remains rather small but lingers for the duration. Quite striking is the aroma, which is inviting as well as complex; the usual roasted malt and caramel is present but portwine and cherry play strong accompanying roles. The first sip is smooth and very warming. The overall impression the beer makes is rather like a rich and sweetish tasting stout mixed with a good cognac or portwine. The tastes are really pretty amazing, and each sip is a little different, and draws you in, leaving you wanting more. Hints of caramel, plum and bubble gum are all present, and the beer finishes with a soft cherry note. 
The beer came to me highly recommended and has not disappointed. At 11.3 ABV and being heavy bodied and rich it is not something I could see drinking on a regular basis, but it makes an excellent digestif and would certainly be a good winter beer. The next bottle I plan to age and see how it tastes in two years time. Excellent.","Butzbach, Hesse, GERMANY","hauxe"

Taste wise, a lot of candy like notes with some considerable alcohol given its age, more red licorice, light molasses, raisin, and again ""Original Ricola"" that heads into some caramel malt notes, light bitterness, a Fishermans Friend like note, light rye crisp, graphite, and some light sourness in the finish.

Amazingly complex and delightful aroma, perhaps a bit overpowered by booze. The flavors that come across are just amazing. Raisins, plums, figs, and an estery banana flavor to bundle them all together. Again, the booze is prevalent, but its nice.

2854,"2015-03-03",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2016 330 mL bottle poured into a goblet. The aroma is initially a bright cherrywood note with a touch of smokiness and a light resin quality. This aroma blends into a port wine note consisting of an alcohol touch with fruity flare - tart cherry, plum, strawberry, and a light banana note - with undertones of buttery pie crust and brown sugar. It?s a murky opaque dark cherry brown with a dense foam, tan head that retains a medium-thick ring and a solid, soft foam surface, and leaves only a light, but dense wisp, lacing on the glass. The taste is a medium high bittersweet port wine. The texture is thick and oily with an abundant fuzzy carbonation to smooth things out. The body is full with lots of plum and raisin notes as well as a woody feel. There?s a mellow and smooth wine warmth at the finish with toffee, sweet cherry, and plum flavors. The aftertaste is dry and clean with a toffee and spice touch.

Aged 1 yr, 3/13/2016. Strong boozy wood aromas greet the nose with bourbon port wine. This settles to eventually reveal caramel and cola. It pours a murky raisin color with soft, light, beige head that showd mild retention and sparse lace. The taste a a medium high sweet with a medium bitter. Foamy carbonation accompanies a slick texture. The medium full body has a woody spice and cola profile with a light leather quality. Tastes of smokey, light raisin emerges and turns to chocolate and cherry. The finish is similar to port wine with a clove spice and a light grape jelly.

2854,"2014-12-15",4.9,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2016 This is certainly a respectable Quadrupel Trappist.
A Belgian character, because it is a strong beer, more rustic, with a remarkable dose of hops.
A peculiar aroma taking your body a dark color, almost black which forms a beige high foam, dense and medium term, as a Quadrupel should be.
Your scent is really striking. Alcohol is a little more noticeable, and lightly sweet and roasted malt has your palate with fruity touch - plums, raisins and perhaps port wine.

Your aftertaste I was transferred a taste peel fresh plums. This taste was showing up more and more evident during the tasting, appearing quite along with the warm feeling of alcohol.

2854,"2014-12-11",4.1,"The aroma is very much like other quads, filled with sweet dark fruit notes complimented with some funky notes. Looks as bad as westy 12 in the glass, dark dank mud water with carbonation. But if you now anything about this style you know that is a good sign! Taste is like the aroma multiplied several times, complex mixture of dark fruits, rum notes and some malt tones.

Aroma is raisins, plums and belgian yeast. Im also getting some well integrated chocolate/caramel. Taste is along the same lines with mostly dried fruits. The main feature isnt sweetness, it remains relatively dry even with the intense dried fruits flavors. It is slightly tart and there is a substansive alcool warmth. Some old ale notes: Tobacco, port (slight oxydation from the age). Palate feels a little light with high carbonation which I dont appreciate is such a big beer. It is still well done considering the belgian strong ale category. A stellar example of a style Im not fond of.","Quebec, CANADA","Luk_"

2854,"2014-10-29",4.7,"11.2 oz bottle, poured into a bell glass at approximately 50 degrees F.

A: Pours like free-flowing molten caramel, and forms a massive four-finger frothy head that lasts a long while before eventually dying to a half-finger cap. Once in the glass, the beer becomes a thick, impenetrable fog of burnished bronze. The iPhone flashlight test reveals light seeping through only around the edges, which take on a ruddy-copper glow. Bubbles can be seen steadily rising from the bottom in that light. Impressive sheets of lacing cling to the glass.

S: That is a heady bouquet indeed. Sweetness and booze are the initial impression, wreathed through with an array of fruits - cherry, plum, grape, and something that reminds me of a nectarine, not unlike a particularly confused orchard, or one of those odd Frankentrees being created these days. There are some hints of caramelized malt sweetness beneath.

T: Quite in sync with the nose! I find myself struck right out of the gate with sugary sweetness wrapped around sweet boozy warmth, which fades slightly into the background as the rush of fruits thunder in. All the fruitiness of the aroma is present, along with some hints of over-ripe apple and dates. Malty sweetness can be detected, quietly filling in what few cracks and crevices the other flavors may have missed. The finish ends with a slight alcohol burn, which persists for a bit.

M: Creamy-smooth, lush, rich, and full, this is a joy on the palate and tongue.

O: I see why this beer receives the marks it does. While I am still more a fan of the St. Bernardus Abt 12, this is quite the malty, yeasty, satisfying experience.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Taste starts with very subtle autumny fruit notes, followed with quite harsh alcoholic-caramelly-plummy notes, then settling with more mellow, balanced, sweet autumny fruits, wintery spices, and almonds. Its got a medium plus body with gentle carbonation and a surprisingly soft, velvety texture... It finishes dry, even a bit woody.

I was really hoping for a 5 or close to it with this one, and while i liked it more than any other belgian beer ive had to date, it fell just short of ""blow your socks off status"".

Not my first foray with this fine Trappist ale, however never actually got around to rating it - 1200th rate seems an apt occasion!
Its a mysterious, somewhat sinister looking brew - deep, murky burgundy holding a small but thickly textured beige head.
The aroma is seductive, alluring, yet somewhat familiar & homely. Rich dark sugars, certainly an earthy candy sugar of sorts in there, which adds its own complexities of roast beetroot & rumminess, but thats merely the tip of the iceberg - chocolate pudding, black cherry & plum, and maybe even prunes, and why not some raisins! Theres some spice in there too; clove, black pepper, nutmeg - phenolically derived, one would have to assume.
Theres something about the weight of this beer, that just seems right. Yeah, sure, 11 or so percent, more than double strength, up there with wine, rah rah, but it just sits so nicely on the palate - velvety, thick, luscious, welcoming, friendly, warming, tremendously persistent in the best way possible. No other beer seems to be able to emulate the texture of this beer.
HOOK IT TO MY VEINS! Ahhhh... There are very few beverages in the world that compare to the refined complexity of this ale - perhaps the finest old Port or aged Bordeaux - theres something special going on here; chocolate, treacle, rum, raisin - starting to sound like a dessert! Vinous plums, and cherries, and black raspberries, and some other berry I dont know the name of, and then theres dried fruits too, and spices, and some leafy hop character, and some yeasty breadiness. What starts sweet soon dries out, a tickled of bitterness provides balance, and it just lingers with a cheek pinkening warmth, and begs oh so politely for another sip, and before you know it you realise you were foolish for only purchasing JUST ONE BOTTLE!
So in conclusion: what have we learnt? Many choose to make parallels between this and its fabled (and exceedingly rare) Trappist brother, the Westvleteren 12. And this is a fair comparison, and shall probably be hotly debated until the end of time. Would personally love to do a side-by-side tasting; some day. Until then, my favourite will be this beer, based on two points - yes, the Westy is amazing, and has some intrinsic qualities not seen in ANY other beers, but it lacks just a bit of body compared to the Rochefort, and, of course, obviously, theres the simple fact it is just so hard to come by (without forking out exorbitant quantities of cash). So hail to the king...baby","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

2854,"2014-06-21",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2014 Credo proprio che sia la mia birra preferita! Almeno tra quelle che ho provato finora. ASPETTO: mogano scuro, quasi nero a bicchiere pieno. Schiuma finissima e persistente (ne rimane sempre un filo sulla birra), marroncino chiaro con riflessi dorati. AROMA: complesso ed equilibrato allo stesso tempo. Emergono i sentori liquorosi. GUSTO: in bocca è una perfezione di sapori e di equilibrio. Si avvertono vari sapori, soprattutto del maltato, prugna secca, del tostato, della liquirizia e anche chiarissime note di cacao, nonché dellevidente e invitante liquoroso (Marsala e Porto). Corpo decisamente strutturato, carbonizzazione bassa (il giusto per questa birra). Lalcool si avverte nella bevuta, esaltando i sapori, ma non da minimamente alla testa, benché lABV sia dell11,3%.
CONCLUSIONE: ho assaggiato molte birre di qualità eccelsa, ognuna con delle caratteristiche particolari. Tra le tante, fino ad ora (anche se mi è difficile scegliere), credo che sia questa la mia preferita. Ne ho trovate altre con sapori ancora più forti, ma questa, come dicevo prima, è un vero capolavoro si gusto, sapori ed equilibrio.

2854,"2014-06-14",4.8,"La première gorgée de Rochefort 10 continue de me surprendre par sa texture malgré la fuite des ans et les multiples récidives. Cest une sensation étrange, veloutée, légèrement grasse, à la fois douce et âcre, nutritive et éthérée. Lorsque jétais enfant, ma grand-mère machetait des bâtons dextrait de réglisse concentré. Je les cassais et les laissais fondre dans un peu deau. Le sirop ainsi produit était dun brun noirâtre et lorsque on lagitait , une mousse épaisse et beige se formait par dessus. Ce sont toutes ces couleurs et cette saveur que la Merveille rappelle à mes sens : la douceur un peu piquante et amère de la réglisse, lacajou noirâtre de son suc. En si bonne compagnie, on nest jamais à court de sensations. Au nez, des effluves de fraise très mûre, de banane, de pâte à crêpe aux raisins de Corinthe macérés dans du vieux rhum. Et parlons-en de rhum, ou de vieux quetsche, de boukha, dArmagnac Napoléon. Car du haut de ses 11,3° dalcool, cette bière, telle un grand vin tutoie les Dieux brûleurs de gorge et ennemis du chagrin. Je conseille de la déguster devant un feu de bois, un soir dhiver, en écoutant Dave Holland. Quand elle vieillit (jen ai en cave de plus de cinq ans, ce qui me motive grandement à ne pas mourir trop vite), elle sent davantage la prune et son goût se madérise, rancit comme on fleurit : à petites touches de pain dépice, de miel de châtaignier. Qui sait quelle saveur elle aurait à vingt ans  Mais personne na jamais su lattendre aussi longtemps.","Liège, BELGIUM","BenoitLhoest"

2854,"2014-06-13",4.7,"This was quite a full beer, so its good that the bottles only contain 33 cl. While pouring the beer in the glass I could see that this would be a lively beer. With a strong carbonation the top was thick and brownish white, and the beer itself was black as a winter night. The aroma was roasty, and full of caramel, raisins and coffee, while the taste was full and strong. When drinking the beer I could taste a little bitterness, but the beer was also sweet and creamy. It surely has a full body, and with a lively carbonation and long finish I was left with a good feeling.

This is a strong beer, and with the fullness of the body I think its a good thing that the bottles are at the size they are. If I would have to compare it to another beer that I have tasted it must be the imperial stout, by Nøgne Ø (both the aroma and taste are similar).","Oslo, NORWAY","Skrue_McDuck"

2854,"2014-05-26",4.6,"Transferred from BA review on 4-11-12 - 
Poured from bottle into Chimay chalice glass 

Appearance  The beer pours a deep brown color with small hints of red within. The tan head formed upon pouring was quite abundant. It began by fading fast giving way to a head of about half a finger which lasted with some great persistence. After a long while the head faded giving way to an abundant amount of lacing.

Smell  The aroma is heavy of dark fruits; a huge cherry aroma, mixed with prune and raisin. There are also some nice yeasty aromas.

Taste  Sweet flavors for dark fruit first meet the tongue. They are of similar composition to what was detected in the nose; cherry, prune and raisin. Some yeasty flavors and malt flavors then begin to develop shortly after the initial sweet fruit flavors. These are followed by some more subtle lighter fruit tropical flavors of banana and citrus. At the very end some of the alcohol of this 11.3 % abv beer makes its presence known, and with the fruit flavors, leaves a warming sweet taste in the mouth.

Mouthfeel The beer has a higher than average creaminess with a medium level of carbonation. The creaminess give the flavors a good chance to mingle on the tongue, but yet the carbonation matches the fruiter flavors well. While it is very good it is a little on the thin side for a beer of such strength and it makes it a bit too easy to drink.

Overall  This is a very good beer. It has wonderful dark fruit flavors and a nice warming kick. One to have every once in a while as a nice treat.","","Darkmagus82"

Its soft and sweet and the alcohol is well noticable, but its very warming. The finish reminds me of cacao, is a litlle dry and bitter and stays for a while.

2854,"2014-05-24",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2014 My oh my, this is a complex one! Bottle, 330ml. Pours a very murky dark duby with around a finger of tan head, which doesnt stick around too long and leaves some degree of lacing. Aroma consists of, in rough order of arrival, caramel and toffee malts, dark fruits such as raisins, cream, vanilla (possibly forming into cornish vanilla ice cream), honey, spices, little bit of alcohol, and finally notes of nut praline. And using the same system, the taste consists of VERY sweet caramel, clotted cream fudge, toffee, vanilla (again reminiscent of cornish vanilla ice cream), nut praline or caramel, tiny bit of alcohol, some sweeter fruits such as oranges perhaps, and right at the back a bit of bitterness to balance the whole thing out.

Lovely sweet aroma of dark ripe fruits, pear, cola and liqorice. However the aromas could have been more powerfull. Sweet taste, you taste dark fruits, alcohol and liqorice. Sweet in the mouth, bitter aftertaste. Not very nice aftertaste, bit of liqorice-bitterness. The alcohol really burns in the mouth and throath, during drinking it as well as when you swallowed it.

First taste is fer sure alky like forward but perhaps more civilized in nature than most all Americana wannah beez. Some warming as it travels down the gullet toward its destination. Fairly refined for such a high alky content. Decent creamy co2 hides the overall numbing effects. Perhaps you like it that way; hiding the mind blowing effects behind a somewhat irritating belgian trappy. As the session continues it becomes more difficult to ignore the alky content behind the civilized manners.

The taste is mainly spicy sweet booze, cherries become more of an undertone to the flavoring, big boozy aftertaste, and a dry spicy finish.

2854,"2014-01-12",4.2,"The Famous Abbey St Remy Rochefort #10. Purchased at a beer and wine shop, not aged much. Begins with a solid but not too strong aroma of dark fruit, chocolate and caramel malt. appearance is a distinctive heavy hazy brown body with an eggshell-white fluffy head that reduces quickly but does not disappear. Flavor strength is also solid but not too strong, really just right. As other reviewers have noted, this beer really does feature a perfect level of carbonation, which among other effects keeps this beer from having too vinous a texture. Flavor is exceedingly complex as expected, malty with dark fruit notes and some roasty/burnt accents. Highlight for me is the subtle chocolate malt finish which I do not recall in the Rochefort #8 Ive previously sampled. Strong alcohol content is masked well. A pleasant long lasting cocoa finish. Savory indeed.
""Fine-tuned"" is the word that comes to mind when I consider this brews keenly balanced aspects and ornate complexity. That being said, I think I recall enjoying the Rochefort #8 more than this beer, although they are similar and both are top of the line on a global scale.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"

2854,"2014-01-07",4.3,"Best before August 13, 2018.
Appearance: Rochefort 10 pours a murky garnet hue, though without bright light the body appears an opaque chestnut. The head is tall and dense, forming an uneven light khaki colored head that is very persistent.
Aroma: Oh boy the aroma is huge. I get booze, butter, brown sugar, plum, grape and caramel with a very light spice to this. The aroma is huge and would match a big cheese no problem. 
Taste: The intro is very unsuspecting of the rich maltiness to follow. The intro is mild, though malty, with brown sugar hinting on the tongue. The beer picks up steam mid-way with a prominent brown sugar presence and a slight medicinal grape flavor. The finish builds further, a bit earthy with some clove, adding to the growing in boldness mid-flavors. The finish lingers for a bit of brown sugar and clove with underlying grape-soda like fruitiness.
Palate: Big and bready.
Overall: This is a phenomenal quad. I dont remember it being as fruity as this, but Ill take it. This is a standard to which other quads should be looked at. I would love this with some bold cheese.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

2854,"2013-12-25",4.1,"Originally rated on 25/12/2013 as Christmas 2013 Belgian Quads Parallel Tasting"" - Part 1 of 3

330 ml bottle bought at CitySuper in Harbor City, Tsim Sha Tsui.

Preparation: bottle maintained at ambient temperature of 10°C - 12°C overnight; Popped at 13.9°C (within recommended temperature range) onto the Chimay chalice.

Looks: Translucent deep brown colour with lots of dirt-like yeast sediments; One finger head and light beige foam which lasts for about 2 minutes; Very good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant raisin, plum, dark fruit and port wine which can be smelt as soon as it was popped and half a foot away, with whiskey, wood, light musty, faint alcohol and light sugar.

Taste: A bliss of flavours, started out with warming alcohol and sugar, followed by malt with strong plum, assorted dark fruits, strong whiskey, brandy, Bel yeast, light spices, faint bubblegum, strong liquorices, lime and light grass. Some taste!

Body: Close to medium, watery and strong alcoholic palate.

Mouth Feel: the first few sips with light alcohol and sugar come first. Subsequently the whiskey, brandy and liquor taste takes over and the booze starts to roar with the dark fruits and woody barrel sweetness come through. Full malt and yeast stayed in the background.

Booze: It has all the nice liquor character, and the 11.3% booze start to lay waste like Godzilla midway through the session, so gotta sip carefully!

Hoppiness: Very muted grassy nose, strong bitter lime, light spice and muted grass to taste. Liquorices is strong with initial sips, but was overwhelmed by the booze thereafter for brandy-like astringent finish.

After Taste: Barely dry, boozy and sweet to mouth.

Comments: Finally got the chance to taste this one. I must say the 10 is the only Rochefort that deserves the Trappist name: it is boozy as usual, much more so than 8 and 6, but it was backed up with very nice whiskey and brandy warmth with some barrel aged woodiness. While its dark fruit, spice and other tastes are a bit light, its still very nice. A nice hard liquor disguised as beer, it will please many who like something hard-edged as well as crafty. I appreciate the 10 for its complexity, yet out of the best 3 Belgian Quads (Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12, and Westvletren XII), this is the least convincing.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Carbonation is fairly soft but quite active, cuts the rich plate and keeps balance. Some warmth from the alcohol, but not boozy.

Der Nachgeschmack ist fein-herb, aber deutlich milder als beim Westvleteren 12, dafür um einiges aromatischer und bei weitem nicht so klebrig süß. Toll ausgewogen, so dass die Aromen dunkler Früchte noch lange auf der Zunge zurückbleiben.

Aroma is mildly fruity, with grapes, wine, dark malts, raisins, brown sugar, licorice, earthy yeast. Taste has a nice play between an initial intense sweetness and the final winey bitterness. Full bodied, carbonated, alcohol is there and it burns on this impressive 11.3, but it does not cover the complexity and could be said being around 8%.

Aroma is slightly akin to a fine red wine. Dark, red grapes, figs, raisins, & vinous booze, with lots of malty undertones; brown sugar, burnt caramel, toffee, & plums, all with a moderate sweetness flowing through. Taste contains mild alcohol warmth, grapes, plums, sweet malty caramel & brown sugar, a touch of back-end floral notes, and some finishing, crisp bitterness. Very nice quad with huge complexity, although I prefer the Rochefort 8 for its superior drinkability and more complex flavor profile.

Aroma is brown sugar, raisins, dried fruit, chocolate, plum- a lot more but I honestly had a hard time distinguishing what the aroma is, that being said, the aroma sets up huge expectations on the taste buds for how amazing it is. Flavor is smooth- moderate sweet and fruity, light to moderate yeast. I wanted the finish to last longer because of how amazing the taste was, which would be the only reason this beast loses any points. Third time drinking this and the first time I really appreciated just how great a beer this is.

2854,"2013-08-27",4.2,"Reviewed 9-9-10.

Sometimes its tough to review a legendary beer after you have not had it in awhile. Questions like: Tastes change over time, and what if I dont like it? are very commonplace - at least in my mind. Anyway, I picked this up over at the Arlington Whole Foods today because...it was there.

I poured this into a sniffer.

Ap: Dark brown, muddy water pour, that adds up to this beautiful fully cabonated (almost champagne-like), dark brew that has the foamiest head Ive seen in a long time - unfiltered obviously.

Ar: VERY subdued, but equally pleasant. I was expecting this big flood of dark fruit to start beating me up (like Raison dEtre), but much to my amazement - no. Sure, Im getting the fruit, but I smell chocolate.

T: Sweet licorice right off the bat, then dates. VERY sweet. I actually think age will mellow this out. Not many fancy spices at all - just good old fashioned malts and sugars. Earthy and then some!

P: Creamy as hell, with the intense sweetness being part of the brews charm. Lots of foamy lacing on the glass.

O: 11.2 fl. oz. was plenty. Because the stuff has an ABV of 11.3, Im feeling pretty good!","Washington DC, USA","Chaneybr"
2854,"2013-08-26",4.4,"(Bottle): Pours a dark murky brown, thin off-white head. Aroma of dark fruits (specifically plums, raisins and red grapes), malt, bread, yeast and a hint of alcohol. Fantastic flavour of plum, raisins, fresh baked bread, yeast, spices with hints of alcohol in the background. Although present, the alcohol is really well hidden considering its such a big abv. The beer is carbonated just right and super smooth to drink. Such an amazingly complex, well balanced and perfectly produced beer.","Merseyside, ENGLAND","Pizd"

2854,"2013-08-25",4.6,"Until I had had West XII, this was my favourite. It is still a phenomenal beer and an absolute must for any beer drinker. A model quad. 

Appearance: dark brown with a head that disappears quickly. No significant lacing. 

Aroma: one of the beer's greatest strengths; a strong, immediate smell of dark cherries, red wine, plums, raisins ...beautifully overpowering. 

Taste: boozy fruit at first, slowly giving way to a dryer sweetness with pleasant alcohol warmth. A buttery, brown-sugar tang hovers nicely at the front of the top of my mouth. So many beautiful flavours, yet it gives preference to fruits and wine over an overall balance. Beautifully complex, changes tastes as it warms, becoming brighter as it opens up and the dark forest fruits really come out on the nose. 

Mouthfeel: medium body with a distinctive alcohol warmth. The taste will hang around in your mouth for hours!

Overall: it is the booziest of the big Belgian quads (Westv., St B 12, Pannepot) but it's complexity and dark fruit notes make it's taste far superior to St Bernardus 12. A lighter body than others (Abt 12's mouthfeel is to die for) and relatively quite boozy. That puts it behind Westvleteren, which also has a beautiful blend of bright *as well as* dark fruits. 
All in all, an unforgettable beer and a world class experience. Easily worth it's AU$10 price tag. Probably the best beer readily available to most people. Be sure to keep a couple of bottles tucked away at all times!!

2854,"2013-08-21",3.9,"Very good, though not really my style. Much more mature and refined than some of the more indulgent and sloppy Belgians. The sweetness isn't overwhelming, instead it blends nicely into the complex dark fruit flavors. Mouth feel is crisp, perhaps a touch too carbonated and effervescent for my taste. Easy drinking for the abv though the alcohol heat is there. Rather than being masked, it is diffused through the entire sip. It's warming in that way. Was a bit sad when the glass was gone. Expensive, but worth it every now and then.

P: A little alcohol tinge. Good flavors. Carbonation is a little aggressive. 

Overall a pretty good beer and probably the best belgian style, but maybe not as great as people think. There are some great flavor notes, and some great fruit. Some nice malt. But just too sweet. The sweetness nails you on the first sip. 

I grabbed a couple bottles and the other one is in the cellar. Maybe Ill give it another go in a couple years and well see then.

Aged a year..... Palate is the only thing that changed really. Palate is mellow. Goes down smooth and carbonation is smooth. Upped from 3 to 5. Also more dry. Still not amazing but definitely one of the better belgians Ive had. Taste from 7 to 8. Overall from 14 to 17. Still has that sweetness but it is more subdued and more of a compliment now than a take away.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"
2854,"2013-04-30",4.7,"A - Pours a deep murky brown with a 1.5 finger of tan head that slowly sinks

S - Raisins, plums, cherries, figs, caramelized toffee, spicy bread dough, hints of chocolate and yeasty banana.

T - Toasty chocolate covered in toffee, rum soaked figs, vanilla bean, clove, pepper, hints of smoke and tobacco. The finish has a warm dry bite that wraps everything up.

M - Like drinking velvet, perfect carbonation.

You could probably drink this 20 times and pick out something new and different everytime. This beer gets a lot of hype but truly lives up to it. Extremely complex. Superb.

2854,"2013-04-29",4.5,"330ml bottle into a goblet.

Pours an opaque dark ruby, almost black, with a light tan one finger head. Really decent head retention and lacing throughout.

The aroma is full of dark fruits such as plums, raisins, dates, and figs. Is quite vinous with a very red wine-like aroma. Some notes of sherry and cranberry. Quite nice.

The flavor provides even more depth than the aroma. Plums and grapes along with sherry and a hint of vanilla. More dark fruit washes over the palate with some oak and plums. Bitterness is on the moderate side with much of the perceived bitterness provided by the alcohol. It is never harsh but is definitely noticeable providing a nice, pleasing warmth in the chest and throat.

Overall, an amazing Quad and one of the best Trappist beers out there. So many complexities in the aroma and taste it is a brew that every true beer fan should experience.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

2854,"2013-04-15",4.8,"Despite the pop when you open a bottle of Rochefort and the brown dirty looking foam, this is my number one beer! It tastes just as good as it sounds, Rochefort! I dont want to go into the nerdish details others do, and taste differs from person to person for sure. But this is a quality beer wich you have to appreciate if you like a full bodied beer with a distinguished sweet taste and a very long and lasting and surpsising aftertaste. The smell is unique and when taking the first sip it dominates your sences of taste immideately. There is a lot of bubbles in this beer, meaning a high CO2, hence the pop you often get when opening this beer. And I have opened more than a lot. When drinking it, it tingles the tongue, making this heavy quadrupple almost as light headed as yourself after drinking three or more in the sun. This Trappist is a bit different then any other Trappists, just like the Westvleteren and the Orval, but I prefer this one above any other of them. Some say the Chimay is the Trappist to be, some prefer the Westmalle (Rated nr.1 and 2 in a Trappist beer contest among Dutch and Belgium Trappist lovers on the web I found out last week.., I have no clue where Ive found that on the web, but it doesnt surprise me). For that matter La Trappe, or Achel, almost forgotten, are also two devine beers, but there is a unique difference between them all and Rochefort, Orval and Westvleteren. The Orval is unique and superb, but so is the Westvleteren 12, and I know taste differs and not a lot of people like the Rochefort because it has such a distinguished taste but that makes the little difference for me. Balance is everything and despite the Westvleteren is more balanced, this is my taste! Rochefort 10 is a divine beer. Its got character, freaking up the entire balance and putting you with both feet on Pluto. If those other beers are supposed to be from other planets, this beer is from Pluto for sure!","","Simmie77"

You can taste some age if you let them sit, a slight musty taste that adds to the fruit a dry almost wooden taste but with Belgian sugar breaking through the pact.

 June 2014 - 2011 vintage into snifter, over 3 years old.  Post-exam celebration.  Very dark brown, red tinge, sparkling, big tan head endures.  Aroma - is less interesting than a young bottle.  Malts, alcohol, some of the bubblegum and incense I got from the young beer, cherry.  Body - medium, touch of carbonation, quite foamy.  Taste - liquorice, nutty, cherry, some drying alcohol.  It has softened up with a bit of age. (3.8)
 June 2015 - 2009 vintage, 6 years old, shared at Pauls.  Aroma is leather, raisin and alcohol.  Taste is mellow malts, sweet with some spice.  This one definitely tastes better after a few years.  (3.8)
December 2016 - Bottle in Cardiff.  Tastes and smells like spiced rum and cola.  Ive found this beer variable - at best its decent and at worst very average but never has it been deserving of its reputation. (3.1)","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

O aroma é surpreendente: álcool, frutas secas, ameixas, carvalho, intenso e duradouro. Logo no primeiro gole, sentimos o poder da breja. A carbonataçao extrema da um toque picante que se junta com o doce típico do estilo. O resultado final é uma complexidade de sensasações, indo de especiarias, passando pela ameixa, banana-passa, pão, com um final alcoólico bastante duradouro. O retrogosto é persistente e igualmente intenso, com o álcool se sobressaindo. Talvez se nao tivesse tanto álcool, ficaria um pouco mais equilibrada, mas isso nao deixou em nada a desejar. Ótima!

A bit too sterile feeling in all aspects makes this world class beer ""only"" almost perfect.","Tampere, FINLAND","Turboninja"

Aroma: Very deep, chocolaty, malty heavy smell. A hint of fruitiness but not very much.

Appearance: A dark but ever so slightly opaque look... caramel and chocolate look for sure with about 55% light transfer.

Taste: One word... WOW. As i said this beer is what made me sign up on this site... i feel i need to tell the whole world! It is a heavy COMPLEX burst of tasty flavors. I cannot describe it; just try it yourself. Redefines a quad for sure.

Palate: Easy to drink with very little taste of the potent 11.3% ABV that is in there. It flows and fizzes like it was made specifically for me. 

Overall: The best beer i have had yet... i will be blown away if i come across another that is better/more enjoyable than this brew.

2854,"2012-12-25",4.2,"UPDATED: MAY 18, 2013 0.33 bottle. Much darker than the Rochefort 8 but still retains some of its purple and red tinge and the same kind of white, yeasty sediment on the bottom. Head is medium and brownish, disappears quite quickly. Malty aroma, coffee, wood, alcohol, definite chocolate, a little bit of dark fruits. Takes a few sips to grow accustomed to the plethora of savors flooding your mouth. A lot of dark fruits but its mostly their bitter side that is present, sweetness comes from malty flavors. Delicate fruity sourness looming somewhere in the background. Body is between medium and full with the indication to the latter. Fine thick texture, carbonation is just below average, much better than in 8. Overall this beer is genuinely great, not really my type but I have to admit its merit. It is undoubtedly more balanced and less astringent that 8, also much more consummate and tempered despite the strength of its flavor and a very high alcohol content, they could work on the aroma though. Will take me a lot more than this occasion to fully apprehend it.","Århus, DENMARK","KoNrRiI"

2854,"2012-12-19",4.5,"Price: $6 / 330ml

Appearance: Reddish dark main with rusted perimeter. Standard khaki head for the style which is thick and low. 
Aroma: Rich in spices, fresh baked bread (like all trappists), and of blue berry jam. Smells slightly of alcohol which is contradicted in the flavor. 
Flavor: The usual caramel and brown sugar but rich with fresh dates, figs (and for that matter prunes), malt, hints of nutty bleu cheese. Purple fruit flavor overall with butterscotch and raisin finish. Has an almost powdered cocoa mid-palette or maybe its just from the sweetness fading to tart. 
Overall: Deceptive for such a dark beer to be as smooth and light bodied as it is. Heavy alcohol flavor but with such a high ABV that is nearly impossible to avoid. The only acidity detected would be that of a stale orange peel. Medium to low carbonation.
Placement: This beer is worthy of putting on a beer list.

2854,"2012-12-14",4.2,"Pours a very dark copper brown but is very clear. Big & lingering tan head with some lacing. Very high carbonation for such a big beer.
The aroma is a toffee/plum with sweet notes and a little bit of heat.
The flavor is big and bold. Caramelized crystal malts on the front end giving off a sweet malty base and the esters of dried plums. It dries off fairly quickly and leaves a fruity sherry-like warmth to it.
Although the warmth is noticeable there is a good balance of elements and is very smooth.
Not picking up too much of that spicy Belgian character, but this is certainly a complex and enjoyable elixir.

Dunkelbraun, leicht trüb mit einigen Schwebeteilchen; der Schaum ist rar und schnell fort. Ein zuerst malzig-würziges Aroma, das nach längerer Standzeit des Glases geradezu einem Dessertwein ähnelt (Mavrodaphne?). Der Antrunk ist auch einem Dessertwein ähnlich, stark und überbordend alkoholisch. Im Geschmack wird die Süße des Würzmalzes von der Hefe gut abgepuffert. Der Abgang ist primär wärmend vom Alkohol; der Hopfen kommt klar zu kurz, schade! Insgesamt ein ordentlicher Trappist, wenn ich auch -wie so oft- was dran zu nörgeln habe: Da fehlt mir ganz klar die Komplexität und Tiefe, die beispielsweise ein Orval bietet. Zwar trotz der 11,3% Alk. gut trinkbar, aber manch ""normales"" belgisches Abteibier hat eine größere Aromenvielfalt zu bieten. Vielleicht bessert sich das ja mit der B-Probe, wenn die Flaschen Rochefort im Keller ein paar Jährchen vor sich hin reifen dürfen!?

2854,"2012-11-13",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2014 My bottle is dated 05/11/13 so nearly exactly 4 years old. Served in Rochefort goblet glass at home.

The Appearance
Rich dark caramel cola in colour. Thin light brown head the disipates to solitary galaxy shaped head driven escaping co2 at the centre of the glass.

The Aroma
Raisan, rum, sherry in spades. Hints of green apple that i often get when a beer has a little oxidation. As the beer opens up and warms up I�m getting more of the boozy alcohol character. The aroma reminds me of mum�s christmas pudding.

Flavour
Initally sweet with the caramel and rasin coming to the fore. The alcohol warming really kicks in half way through the beer. Slight biting finish from the alcohol. Small amount of oxidation,which is impression for a 4 year old bottle of beer, that has probably not given the treatment a beer like this deserves. Rich deep dark decandent full mature.

Palete
Highly carbonated that tingles and numbs the tongue although mellows as the beer opens up. The higher carbonation makes this beer evapourate on the tongue and drives those rich dried fruit aromas up thought nose. This intensified the overall experience. The finish is velvlety 

Overall
A world class beer. To me this will the beer that turned me on to Belgian beer and it will always be up there as on of my favourite beers.

Flavours of intense purple fruit are the first to show up, quickly rolled under the spice and brandy from the nose. Finishes with a not unpleasant warming sensation that will have to do since Im without a fireplace this evening.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","Atheist_Peace"

A: Pours a dark brownish purple, like a dirty grape, with lighter hues around the edges. Quick tan head that subsides into a nice film ring.

S: A little boozy with some slight dark fruits. Raisins and figs. There is a nice sweetness at the backend that rounds it out.

T: Nice dark berries on the tongue. Raisins, blueberries and figs all present. A sugary sweetness takes over from there which is really nice. There is some slight toffee or caramel as well. Finally there is a little heat that warms the throat.

We are doing Trappistes Rochefort 10 vs. St. Bernardus Abt. 12. Color is the same and the head is the same - orange brown and a bit cloudy.

Taste of St. Bernardus is (surprisingly) salty at the beginning then bitter and not so balanced actually. Rochefort palate is medium body, soft carbonation, oily texture. St. Bernardus is medium body , oily texture ,  average carbonation.  For me and my girlfriend Rochefort is the winner - its much more complex on the nose and taste.

It brings up more of the complicated flavors like molasses, even more dark sugary raisins and liqourice than before.

2854,"2012-09-10",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2012 S: Very complex but the layers are easily perceived due to the excellent balance: tart, dry apple and grape up front - a bevy of dried dark fruits, raisins and figs - strong caramel malt character that brings an old ale to mind. I could sniff all up on this forever. A: Dark, dark, dark brown and when held up to the light it reveals a chocolate color. The head is fantastic - upon pour it is a mix of small and large bubbles fizzing away at each other, when it settles it leaves a film of creamy retention. When swirled, alc legs appear. There are pretty large pieces of sediment floating around and IÃ¢â¬â¢m ok with it. T: The darkness comes through by way of the dried fruits that have taken the prominent place away from the tart apple/grape first detected by the nose. It really does have an old ale feel, which is a big check-plus in my book. Alcohol is completely hidden and I wish it were more present - I would love the warming sensation added to this. The caramel character is much more molasses like - real dark and gooey. P: Pretty full bodied brew, nothing like an imperial stout, but the fullest Belgian IÃ¢â¬â¢ve had. Long lasting finish and the carbonation doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t get in the way of the experience. O: I havenÃ¢â¬â¢t had very many Ã¢â¬â¢hyped-upÃ¢â¬â¢ brews before, but this one met and overcame all expectations. The only reason IÃ¢â¬â¢m not giving it a perfect score is because I havenÃ¢â¬â¢t tried enough beers yet and I do not know what perfect is to me yet, but this is surely the closest IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come.

2854,"2012-08-25",4.8,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip.

A: Pours a very dark ruby red color with good clarity and little yeast floaties on the bottom of the glass. The head is initially a three finger light mocha color with huge bubbles and a bubbling carbonation show, ultimately settling into a one finger head with a nice creamy texture. Little lacing is left on the glass.

S: Very vibrant. Chocolate, raisins, currants, plums, cherries, green pear, cloves, and spices all intermingle with great complexity; every smell provides a subtly different aroma.

T: The first sip brings waves of darker dried fruits, leaving a fantastic chocolaty finish and aftertaste. The initial sips give way to more of a flavor very reminiscent of cherry pie filling. At various points afterward, I can also pick out light licorice, hints of grassy hops, fig newtons, chewing tobacco, brown sugar, spices, and other subtle hard-to-identify flavors. Stunning complexity with a fantastic lingering aftertaste. This is freakin heaven, plain and simple. The alcohol is as perfectly integrated as Ive ever seen in a beer, warming the body without being palpable on the flavor.

M: Amazingly smooth until the midtaste, where the yeasty astringency builds dryness on the tongue, giving it surprising drinkability. Alcohol lightly stings the tongue in conjunction with the carbonation. The dryness becomes a bit excessive at times, but otherwise it feels fantastic on the palate

O: Plain and simple, a triumph of brewing finesse. Faint niggles here and there cant even come close to ruining this beers immense glory. Magnificent.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Nose is dark dried fruits - cherries, plums, prunes, raisens and sweet caramel.
Taste married aroma, rich, fruity and complex with candied sugar and a pinch of cocoa.
Medium bodied verging on full with a low level of carbonation that was just right.
Great tasting quad.

------- at the Rochefort 10 Mass Online Tasting, bottle at home (from the supermarket at Brussels Midi) - 13/11/12.
Room temperature having been removed from the beer cupboard an hour or so before drinking.
Pours opaque dark mahogony brown with a huge tan heaf that quickly subsides. Small bubbles and carbonation present on the surface. A small part of the original head remains as an off centre pond after 3 or 4 minutes.
Rich caramel on the nose, dark fruits, toffee, prunes, sweet plummy tones, light floral tones, dark sugars and a whiff of booze in the background.
Tastes of rich warming dark fruit tones. Dark toffee, sugars, booze is amazingly well balanced for 11.3% unlike any other beer ! A little nuttiness, sweetness is just right, not overbearing the dark fruit flavours are sweeter in the taste than on the nose, figs, dates, sweet plums. Goes up from 8 to 9.
The carbonation was a little too prickly to start and I was going to drop from a 5 to a 4, however after 10 minutes or so it had pretty much vanished. Soft and warming in the finish. Still a 5.
Overall I enjoyed this beer more on the 2nd rating. I think warming it and letting the carbonation die off helped. A great beer that costs relatively little in Belgium. The alcohol is sooooo well hidden, rich dark fruits, warming and a touch of booze - overall score goes from 17 to 18. Total 4.2 to 4.4.

2004 bottle @ De Heeren van Liedekercke. This has always been one of my all-time favorites, but to try an aged bottle was a different experience. Drinking an 04 version was full of plum, raisin, fig, and rich dark fruits. Theres light booze but it has tons of fruits and just delicious. Ive had Westvleteren 12 on more than a handful of occasions at this point and I have come to realize that Rochefort 10 is more complex than it and only lacks the rarity factor of Westy 12.

Sweet caramel and syrupy maltiness combines with rich spiciness and dark fruitiness; notes of raisin, plum, licorice and even a hint of chocolate. This certainly does not lack nuances: every time I have this, something new seems to appear. Taste is really strong and potent; alcohol is masterfully hidden. Initial sweet maltiness slides into a long, rich and slightly bitter finish. Raisins and other dark fruits have the strongest presence in the taste but there is much variety. Hoppy notes give a little balance in the aftertaste but this is definitely a malts-driven ale with yeast adding depth. The palate is full bodied with a thick, smooth mouthfeel.

Taste is big on astringent alcohol, balanced by sweet candied sugar and syrupy burnt malts. A strong,smoky, dry scotch-like flavor which is uncommon for the style is dominant. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Head contributed a smooth creaminess to beer. Finish was semi dry and astringent. 

Overall this beer was good but a bit too heavy on the booze side. Strong, malt forward flavors make this a complex beer, but I think it needs to age acouple more years before its at its prime drinking state.

2854,"2012-07-18",4.2,"I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a Trappist chalice

Appearance: Opaque dark shade of maroon/brown; forms a small, off-white, soapy head which fizzles like a soda but does retain a bit but doesnt lace the glass. 

Smell: General dark fruit fragrance plus notable alcohol sweetness. 

Taste: Usually when it comes to beer the fresher it is the better it is, but in the case of a beer like Trappistes Rochefort 10 the opposite is true. My bottle was dated 16/11/16 which I assume means it was bottled on 16 November 2011. Since Ive encountered many  Belgian beers of the style I know the beers palate will change over time and usually for the better. Thats not to say this beer is bad in the slightest bit - just that it didnt seem to be fully matured at the time I drank it. But if this is an immature brew, its still quite impressive for what its able to accomplish.

Like most others it begins with a pure energetic sensation. Intense Belgian carbonation combined with a sweet taste of dark fruits and a vodka or rum-like alcohol taste open the palate. It makes itself known from the get-go and it makes no apologies for its character. Unlike most which have a wine-like taste to them, this one keeps in the tradition of the 6 and the 8 with confectionary-like sweetness rather than fruity sourness. Toffee and caramel are quite prominent throughout the second half, with minor bitterness and dryness to round out the palate. The aftertaste is remarkably clean (maybe a little too clean), although theres just a trace amount of alcohol to be found. A delectable palate for sure, but it seems like more will happen with some age on this body.

Drinkability: If Trappistes Rochefort 10 is the most robust of the Trappist quads, its also the most spastic in the mouth. The carbonation dances on the tongue, almost causing a bit of a friction burn and it does get stuck in through making it difficult to take more than a sip at a time. While its obvious its a potent beer, it never seems to be as dense as its 11.3% ABV weight would otherwise have you believe. Alcohol is detectable, but its not flagrant or distracting. Id imagine an older vintage would be perfectly smooth, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Dried apricot, peach, and various citrus fruit in its dehydrated, dry form.  The tangy-ness is unbelievable. No hint of booze until the head fades away and gets near room temperature.  Appearance is dark-ruby with tan head.  Taste is sweet and very boozy.  Boozy in the pleasant sense and not the chemical sense.  It warms you from the inside on a cold winter day.  Palate is perfect, not too prickly, not too flat.  Just right.

Pours dark with a white head that quickly dissipated to leave a dull looking drink, but the lack of a head probably helped as the first sniff really packed a punch - a heady mix of boozy fruit, sweet spices and almost like a Christmas pudding.

Very viscous mouthfeel.  Yeast presents itself firmly on the last half of the palate with a chewy yeast and tongue covering heavy blanket.  Deep plum flavor.  Lots of barn as well - not a Brett led barn, but just full, massive, complexity of flavors only found in the countryside - perhaps resembling dried meadow.  Alcohol present throughout, but shows most on the finish.  You can wring out your tongue (by squeezing it with your teeth) minutes after a taste of this beer and still get many of the sensations.

A little acidic, but cant complain much about this beer at all - deserves its rep.  A sure four-plusser.

R10 on monimuotoisempi maultaan, mutta anis todella vahvana. Yhteenvetona: Abt 12 on ""helpompi"", pehmeämpi ja kauniimpi olut. R10 sisältää Rocheforteille tyypillisen anismaisen tuoksun.

2854,"2012-05-17",4.5,"The beer pours a wonderful thick burgundy color, hues of dark browns but also ruby red when placed near the light. The head on this beer is insane, sits about a finger high but sticks around indefinitely and leaves behind some amazing lacing as well. The aromas are amazing, lots of the famed Belgian yeast, cloves, toffee, a bit of caramel, brown sugar, and finished with a big kick of dark fruits, fig, dates, plums and even a bit of cherry. The alcohol is definitely prevalent in the nose, but it doesnt detract from the beer, even with the heavily sweet aromas. The flavors follow suit very well and are just as complex, the yeast again kicks off the flavors, mild clove, some banana, candied sugar, lots of spice, perhaps cinnamon or allspice, some nutmeg flavors are notable as well. Dark fruits again take over the finish on this beer, plum and prune are big elements, hints of dates play with the spices and yeast so well and are balanced with some rich toffee, caramel and nougat flavors with faint alcohol at the end. The body is so rich and full, coats the mouth so well, goes down so smoothly, about as perfect as it gets.

One of the best classic quads, I like the Westvleteren 12 a bit better, but for a beer I can walk to the store any day of the week and grab for a great price, this cant be beaten (alas, Westvleteren can only be consumed in 2 bars here!!!).

2854,"2012-05-11",4.7,"What a surprise. I have been on a quest to purchase a Trappist Westvleteren 12 while living just south of Belgium. To make a long story short, they dont sell it in stores, but they have a crazy list of rules that are posted on the abbey of Saint Sixtus of Westvleteren website (http://www.sintsixtus.be/eng/brouwerij.htm#Be I started to pick up all the interesting beers that I could find in various stores. And, I came across the Trappistes Rochefort 10. Score!

330ml bottle into a Tournei tulip. Drank February 23, 2012.

Appearance (5.0): After only drinking different Belgium beer for the past couple of weeks, I have learned how to make a good pour. The Rochefort has a thick head, roughly 1/3 the size of the pour. The head stays firm, slowly disappating over the course of the drink, leaving long laces of The dark brown beer is a nice contrast to the head.

Smell (4.5): A complex smell of cherry and chocolate, flowers and coke. Effervescent bubbles tickle the nose.

Taste (5.0): For a dark beer, the taste was fruity, but still a true Belgian feel. Despite the high alcohol content, it wasnt overwhelming in the mouth. Started and finshed creamy.

Mouthfeel (4.5): There is a response to most Belgiums for me, where the first two sips are full of bubbles. The carbination is overwhelming, but settles down for the rest of the glass.

Overall (5.0): This ranks at the top of all beers I have had. I need to sit down and try one later ... with some good friends. Ill try to brig a few home to the states if my friends are unable to find a few bottles at House of 1000 Beers (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/15450 just lucky to have another of a ""Top 10"" beer ... even if by accident.

2854,"2012-04-03",4.2,"Bottle.  Pours brown, with a thick head and a fair amount of yeast sediment.  Rich aroma, mostly of caramel, and a touch of yeast.  Very complex flavor - brown sugar, caramel, dark fruits, raisin, banana, alcohol, and some yeast on the finish.  Maybe its just this bottle, but a little bit overcarbonated, which detracts from the mouthfeel.  Still, a first-rate Trappist ale.","Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","TOSG55"
2854,"2012-04-02",4.3,"Pours a dark cloudy brown with two finger tan head. Good retention. Smells like dark exotic fruits, molasses, raisins and a hint of vanilla.

Really good stuff!","New York, USA","mcmisko"
2854,"2012-04-02",4.4,"Bottle. Drank fresh. A heavyweight of Belgians for sure. The scent was a complex mix of molasses, brown sugar, dough, and yeast with some grape-like acidity to finish. The pour was a dark brown similar to the color of a coconut shell with a frothy light tan head and I spotted some floaties in there. The medium bodied, crisp finishing palate also had a very fizzy mouthfeel, and the taste was boozy hot! Definitely want to age this one for a while. Dont get me wrong, I loved the taste, lots of dough and dark fruit, raisin, plum, but also a hot finish.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","PGHbeer77"

Laroma si sente appena viene stappata la bottiglia, e invia al cervello immediati messaggi: "" bevimi, bevimi"". Aroma, che risulta caramellato, liquoroso con sentori di uva passa e una venatura di cioccolato. Gusto complessissimo, pieno e che rapisce completamente la lingua in un vortice vellutato di note caramellate, di prugne, spezie e un casino di altre cose che ora mi scoccio di scrivere. Resta comunque il fatto che se la vedete compratene 2 bottiglie: una la conservate (se ci riuscite) a farla maturare e laltra la bevete, dopo una lunga giornata lavorativa o dopo un esame, lasciandovi trasportare dal suo gusto stupendo.

2854,"2012-03-30",4.5,"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 7/27/2016.  Pours very murky dark brown color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers.  Spotty lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up.  Aromas of big plum, raisin, caramel, banana, molasses, clove, pepper, biscuit, roasted malt, light chocolate, and yeast spices.  Awesome aromas with great complexity.  Taste of big molasses, caramel, plum, raisin, prune, pepper, clove, banana, candi sugar, and yeast spices.  Lingering notes of dark fruit, banana, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a while.  Fantastic balance of sweetness and spiciness; with no cloying at all.  Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel.  Incredibly lush and smooth mouthfeel as well.  This drinks way too smoothly for 11.3%, but is still definitely a sipper.  Alcohol is practically invisible, with pretty much no warming noticed.  Overall this is a beautiful Quadrupel.  Big complexity, smoothness, and flavor balance.  Amazing.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Bind tasting with Westvleteren / St Bernardus Abt12 / Rochefort 10.
Ranking: #1 West, #2 Rochefort, #3 Abt12.
West is more creamy, fine, spicy, complex and rich than Rochefort.
But Rochefort is not so far from West: maybe a bit more intense, powerful, alcoholic than West, with a dominance of vinous flavours, candied fruits...
Abt12 is too yeasty, not subtle enough to compete against the two other quads.
Rochefort is always available, at EUR 4/bottle. West is sold at EUR 11 and is available when the third Moon of Armaggeddon is eclipsed by the ass of a dark troll. Shit Mate, if youre not a Monk from the place you can only register yourself on a waiting list .... and wait.

Tastes a bit sweeter than Id expected - plum, candied sugars, balanced malts.  This is the taste I imagine when I think Trappist quad.  Its not overwhelming at all to the palate.

Taste is equally joyous - raisin, a tart fruitiness, dark fruits/raisins, burnt sugar and caramel, but with a bit of a bitter aftertaste that, with the tart flavour, balances the sweet favours and stops it becoming cloying. SO RICH. Long, sticky-ish aftertaste, medium-full bodied. Slight overcarbonation is the only downside I can spot with this one, and even that goes away with time.

2854,"2012-02-23",4.5,"Currently drinking while typing. Upon pouring you will notice great aromas appearing from the glass, primarily scents of plum, raisin, Belgian yeast, sweet Danish bread, brown sugars, sweet malts and caramels. It doesnt create much of a head at all, of what it does it is an initial soapy bubbly texture which is of a tan brown colour. It soon dissipated into a subtle skimming of fine bubbles that sits on top of a deep chocolate brown murky vessel. Wonderful flavours of soft sweet brown sugars, plum, raisin, breads, Belgian yeasts, well masked booze, cereals, toasts, subtle hops, winter berries and a lasting fresh caramel and cereal malt flavour in the finish. Great full feel in the mouth with incredible smoothness and a subtle carbonation which is absolutely perfect for this beer. In summary this is absolutely brilliant despite the fact this beer never really produces a great head, the flavours and aromas are very complex combined with a smooth and good feel. Although it isnt the same as a Westvleteren 12 you cannot argue with the more reasonable price tag and availability. Highly recommended!","Suffolk, ENGLAND","Storm_Warning"

Very soft and sticky on the palate, low carbonation.  Taste mirrors the aroma very closely.  Bold and complex yet not a kick in the mouth.  More dark fruits, raisin, yeast/spice,  and great warming effect from the alcohol, yet not overly boozey tasting.  High ABV hidden quite well.  A creamy, slightly sweet finish ends the journey.

2854,"2012-02-22",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/24/2009.  Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip.

Quite a strong, dignified pour. A strong brown sugar brown with just a hint of translucence around the edges of the glass. The head does not form right away, but after a patient and proper pour, a healthy foam arrives. Gentle lace clings to the glass.

Strong malt and yeast character in the nose, somewhat caramelly but more vanilla and spice flavors. The alcohol can be subtly noted.

Taste: An extremely complex malt flavor greets the palate. Each sip, particularly with changes in temperature, reveal something new. Figs, vanilla, and caramel are the most obvious flavors, but I have gotten hints of nutmeg and raisins. The alcohol is well-hidden, but I get a little in the middle of the sip. I am left with a slightly tart and dry finish. 

A smooth, balanced feel. Creamy and carbonated at once, and it has a little bit of an oily texture.

Considering the alcohol content, definitely a little bit too drinkable. I did not even think about it being 11.3% until I had breezed my way through my first.  Overall a great beer. Tough to go wrong with a Trappist.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Mostly because this beer has more flavour than any other available on the market. The aroma is decadent chocolate with caramelized Christmas fruits. The taste is pure fornication immersed in brown sugar and plum. I was always taught that if you dont have anything nice to say, dont say anything at all. From now on Ill only ever talk about rochefort 10. Its a safe bet, because no-one could have anything bad to say about this beer.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","DeliriumT"

I would love to compare a fresher bottle, but the 2008 is drinking so maravalous, I couldnt imagine it being better.  Big complex yet utterly smooth dark fruit, raisin, sugar plum (gives off a holiday type feel), some distant funky yeast notes, some cocoa.

This titan of a beer has an unmistakable personality that I havent been able to find in any other beer.  When I get the chance to drink it, I pour it into its wide-mouthed Rochefort chalice with the gold rim.  The brew has a deep, deep ruby color bordering on black.  The head is very off-white and a little splotchy.  It starts out massive and energetic then retreats to a rocky foam that stays through until the end.  The nose is intense and fragrant with fruity yeast, malty dark fruit, some musky, oaky funk and a little dry cocoa.  On the palate, the beer has a lively carbonation with a silky mouthfeel.  It delivers flavors of dark fruit, dates, treacle, fig, plum, sugary malt and christmas pudding.  Those warming, dark fruity flavors really give it a festive attitude and make it prefect for warming up with in front of the fire.

2854,"2011-10-12",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2016 33cl Bottle.  Almost black with a small tan head. It has this fruity apple, anise, dried plum smell and reminds me of an old whysky. Alcohol runs through my nose. NICE and I still didnt take a sip. The body is thick and smooth. After a sip it came more obvious : there has to be some black grape in it. I feel grapes, sweetness of malt, still some apple and a shocking anise background with master pieced hinch of hops and the bitterness that puts this combination in a great harmony. Of course the alcohol is there and there is no secret ; I mean 11,3% has to be somewhere and still its the first time I dont mind it. Clever ! Magic ! Belgian monks did it again. Its a reference. This beer would be a disaster with more carbonation but its just perfect. Creamy, fruity and malty. I know that many brewers would love to make a beer like this.

It was either this or MGD, so I decided to just go for this (J/K).  Appearance a very dark and cloudy plum/brown with a rich off-white head that laces to the glass, very creamy.  Aroma is soft but complex, mixture of dark fruit (plums, apricot a bit), some type of natural syrup, definitely a bit of raisin.  Taste is fantastic, theres no way this can be an 11%er, just way too smooth for that.  The raisins and plum make it smooth and suppress the alcohol flavor, theres a sweetness but I cant really tell what it is, maybe equal parts caramel and chocolate but its a Belgian so Id assume the candi sugar was used, and thats what probably contributes to it but I cant really taste it.

2854,"2011-08-30",3.9,"I cant remember he first time I had this beer but I definitely am glad I chose to rate it tonight. The beer pours with little to no darkened cream head. There is no lacing in the glass and the beer seems to have no head retention. The aroma is really nice. The smell of plum and raisin are met by carmel malts, strong belgian yeast and a serious hint of alcohol. The beer looks like a brown/burgundy mixture with a very cloudy appearance. 

The taste is full flavored with caramel, malt, and dark fruit playing the most significant role. I taste plums, raisins and some of the most balanced malt and yeast I have found in a beer this high in alcohol. The beer has a sweet flavor but the subtle heat of a serious high alcohol stout. Overall, this beer was impressive but its wide availability made me wonder how it retains such a high rating. Perhaps beer newbies find it to be epic. I find it to be great but certainly not in my top 20 beers.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","kylefleeger"

2854,"2011-08-17",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2011 I think I have had this one since the end of 09. Figured today was as good a time as any to open it. Bottle poured into my Delirium tremens tulip.

A - Pours deep dark brown with a huge fizzy two finger off white head, dissipating down to a thick film, leaving thin sheets of lacing down the glass.

S - Smells of rich dark fruits like raisins and dates, candied sugar, banana, dulled chocolate, light spice, and some light alcohol heat. Very nice overall balance. I have had this fresh but I think I now prefer it aged for a few years.

T - Flavors are similar to the nose with the addition of a bit more booze. The balance of dark fruits, candied sweetness, and light heat is a nearly flawless. The finish is a bit dry with a mix of sweetness and dulled heat, lingering for a short while. Overall this is one of the best trappist quads you can find. I have had this fresh, and while it is still good, I think it just gets better with age.

M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Full bodied with some dryness. Finish is a mix of dark fruit sweetness and some dulled alcohol burn.

O - Pretty good. I have had a few of these now and I think I prefer it aged. When it is fresh the booze is a bit overpowering but after a few years it really seems to die down. I am glad I stashed this one in my cellar. One of the best for sure.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Also, holy crap the alcohol! Medium bodied with a very fizzy texture. The carbonation almost makes the beer explode in your mouth. Has quite the long finish on this one. Overall, its pretty good.

2854,"2011-08-13",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2015 Strongly fruity aroma with strong notes of plums and currants, smoothed over with toffee and molasses. Theres also a vinous touch and suggestions of coconut, licorice, and cocoa nibs that grow more evident with temperature. The interplay between the malt sugars and the dark, fruity esters is superb. There is also a noticeable booze component, like dark rum. The palate is medium to thick, with lively effervescence. Its so fizzy that, frankly, its distracting. The taste is grandly complex with lots of sweet notes, a fruity tart touch, and a boozy bitter. It certainly takes longer to figure this one out than the big Westvleteren. The alcohol doesnt bite, but its definitely perceivable, and it warms your digestive tract. The aftertaste is fruity but also quite earthy. Its kind of hard for me to get through the whole bottle. I much prefer the Westvleteren, which is less boozy and more balanced, but this is the more complex and puzzling brew and, overall, an outstanding beer to my taste equally good as its lesser sibling, the 8.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

I cant put my finger on it, but theres this certain candy sweet herbalness going on. Very smooth and well balanced. T - Same as the aroma. Sweet malts, dark fruits, spices and a dash of molasses.

Theres a nice sweetness here and booze is only reflected slightly on the tale end.  Im just amazed at the lively carbonation Rochefort pulls off with this style.

Smell - The smell of the beer is quite sweet and full bodied. I smelled raisins, dates, slight coffee smell and plums. Slightly malty aroma. 

Taste - The beer initially hits the palate with a faint, mellow sweetness that transitions into almost a coffee/caramel taste near the end of the sip. Cannot really taste the alcohol content in the beer, which to me is a good thing.

Mouthfeel - Pretty heavily bodied. The beer was very smooth though and pleasing.

Overall - This beer was quite good. It was not as good as a Rochefort 8 that I had, but it was still exquisite. I prefer the sweetness of the Rochefort 8 over this beers slight coffee taste (as it transitions to the back of the mouth).

The flavour enhances the aroma,  so complex and interesting, everything is blended so well with just the right amount of alcohol. Each sip brings something new - I feel as though I am drinking something antique - reminds one of the whiff of resin off old furniture (its not in the beer - it gives a memory of it !).

Initially kinda tastes like sweet tea, full of caramel and a bitter edge, until a peppery, smoke-laced wave rushes in and evens things out.

Aroma is complex with candied sugars that lead into dark fruits, raisins and plums.  Along with a slight black licorice note and a hint of cocoa.  The taste follows the nose with the dark fruits and sugary malts along with some light rum notes.  The licorice and cocoa peek through in the middle.

Pours a deep brown with a thick off white head. Very complex nose, lots of dark fruits, nuts, fresh and roasted, figs, raisins, plums, dark overripe fruits, a bit spicy, candi sugar. Flavor is just as complex with the dark fruits and candi sugar really bursting along with the delicate spices and brown sugar. More plums. prune, figs raisins all melding nicely to create a balance with the sweet doughy malts and  sweet bread. Finishes a bit spicy but well balanced and smooth.

Mouthfeel is very smooth - liquid and carbonation seemingly combine into a higher synthesis. Taste is sweet with dried fruits, perfectly balanced by a discreet acidity, bitterness and a hint of salt.

Taste is a full-bodied combination of dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins, black currants, as well as chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, and caramel.

Has notes of dried fruit, raisin, prune, yeast, bit of chocolate, but there is an added dimension that R8 doesnt have. Its sherbert, citrous, apples. Its making my tongue tingle.

Not easy to drink this stuff though, really potent. 4.3 Re-rate 14/08/2015 Tasted in comparison to a 2 year aged Westy 12, and I have to say this blows it away. Very dark murky brown cloudy looking beer with a thin off white head. Nose is stunning. Sherberty, candy sugar, dried fruit, plum, prune, raisin, spice, coriander, nutmeg, rye bread and bread dough. This is on another level. Taste is dried fruit, prune, plum, raisin, then coriander, spice, heavy black rye bread, candy sugar, grass. An Arabian wave of spices, sweetness, breadiness and tangy hop.

Appearance: Deep brown-red thats so close to black...the beer looks absolutely gorgeous with a light, creamy head that takes its time sitting there, eventually leaving some complex lacing on the glass.

Taste: Sweet, spicy syrupyness, candied sugar, spices, black liquorice, pepper, dried apricots and other fruits. The finish is slightly bittersweet, but like no other beer Ive tried. Booze integrates well.

Palate: Prickly carbonation, not as full a mouthfeel as you would think making this very easy to enjoy, Balance superb.

Overall: Phenomenal beer. Full (and a huge variety) of flavour, easy to drink, strong, complex, ages very well...could go on forever. Complexities of 8 and this are similar though this is more alcohol driven and stronger in flavour.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","RD400F"

2854,"2011-03-31",4.0,"Im not sure why I had never tried this beer, but I finally did. I think my expectations were too high or I just drank one that was too new.

Poured from a bottle into a goblet, served with yeast (oops). Beer is brown and hazy and some particulates floating in it (my fault its the yeast). Forms a nice thick off white / yellow head that falls away leaving lacing on the glass. Carbonation high. So far so good.

Aroma is a mixture of sweetness and carmel with alcohol and a ton of malt. I think I can smell a slight roast in there as well. Not sure though. Smells pretty good.

Beer is big bodied, no aftertaste at all. There are no hops to detect and bitterness overall is really mild. There is a tinge of alcohol and solvency in the front of the beer and that really disappoints me. Beer gets better and solvency is lessened as the beer warms slightly. Mouthfeel is OK and drinkabiliy is good. I can see how people like this beer but it has not been my favorite Quad.

11.2 oz bottle. 260814 printed on it.

It pours a dark, deep brown with a slight hue of red. There is a lot of sediment. The head is foamy and off-white/tan with tons of dirty looking sediment. It looks rustic and I like it.

The smell is so great. It just smells like an amazing dessert with mainly dark fruits, kirsch, sherry, loads of caramel, sweet dark bread, some cocoa, perfumey floral notes, rum toffee, spices, and port. It is just a intoxicating perfume.

The flavor is nearly as good. It has a huge kirsch/sherry/port flavor to it with that alcoholic kick, but it is like you are drinking a 18% liqueur clocking in at just over 11%. There is some nuttiness that comes through more-so in the taste that blends with the alcohol , bready malt,and dark fruit notes for a luscious decadent dessert flavor. The caramel also comes though with some sweetness on the back end.

It has an intriguing liqueur presence about it that takes it to a high level. The mouthfeel is smooth but with a prickle of carbonation.

A divine brew.

Dark brown, murky. Light brown head. Smells of raisins, plum, apple, caramel, yeast and alcohol. Overwhelming taste! Flavor is sweet with caramel. This must be the definition of a full bodied beer.

Re-rating, 2011-08-25, 8-4-8-4-16=4.0
Finally Im re-rating the biggest of the Rochefort brothers! I suspect that I will like it even better this time.
In a trappist glass this murky, dark brown liquid with its light brown head looks rather nice, so Appearance is up from 3 to 4. I get the same aromas as last time, and more. The dried dark fruits dominate, lots of alcohol, caramel, toasted notes, red port wine, brown sugar, sweet liquorice and some woody oaky notes. Wow. The taste is medium sweet, but isnt there also a tiny hint of bitterness, or is it the alcohol? The flavours are again dried dark fruits, burnt sugar, alcohol, and lots and lots of alcohol in the finish. And then, when I thought the flavours were going to fade away, a wave of sweet caramel hits me. Followed by hints of vanilla, or could it be the oak that I identified in the aroma? Full body medium+ carbonation, oily texture. A fantastic brew with layer upon layer of aroma and flavours, and with a very vinous feel, although I still think that the alcohol is a bit dominating. The beer lacks that more-ish feeling, one bottle is more than enough. By the time the bottle is empty the aromas start to become too sugary sweet and alcoholic, and the flavours get a certain cloying feel. I downgrade Taste from 9 to 8, and decrease Overall from 17 to 16. Strange, it ends up with the same rating as Rochefort 8.

Date on bottle is the date of exipiration, exactly five years from the date of bottling. The date string reads 230113 (d/m/y), i.e. January 23rd, 2013. We deduce this was bottled in January 2008 and as such is now three years old.
Pours a deep dark brown almost black color with tiny light-brown head. The aroma is as strong and potent as ever, with a delicious bouquet of dark fruit engulfing the nose. Plums, raisins, and sweet dates. Such a beautiful, complex, assertive aroma... Surprisingly, after three years, carbonation is still very strong and prickles the tongue. The flavour seems to have lost a bit of its complexity. It has certainly softened over the years but still is an extension of the basic notes of the aroma... plums, raisins, dates. What is new is a less hidden taste of alcohol that has a distinct strong liqueur taste to it. Whether fresh or aged - Rochefort 10 is one of the best beers in the world.","GERMANY","Case"
2854,"2011-01-14",4.3,"Pours a very murky dark brown with a fairly large fizzy head. Head retention is impressive but leaves minimal lacing.

Aroma is a veritable buffet of dark fruits including raisins, plums, figs and grapes. There are notes of caramel accompanied by yeast, molasses and some brown sugar. It is an incredibly complex aroma that took me several minutes and a dozen sniffs to dissect and I still think there are more notes to uncover.

The flavor is a rich combination of the same notes in the aroma. I taste some chocolate that didnt stick out in the nose along with the raisin, plum, fig, grape, caramel, yeast, molasses, and brown sugar. You can barely taste the 11.3% ABV hidden amongst the flavors but you are reminded it is there with the pleasant warming feeling the brew brings as you swallow. I would describe the beers dominant flavor profile to be sweet rather than bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with medium carbonation.

I find the beer goes done smoother and smoother as it warms to room temperature. A stunning combination of flavors are found in this beer.

I would again highly recommend this beer to any beer nerds out there. I am creating quite a streak of amazing beers this past week. Probably because I just decided to do this blog and have been buying all the superstars.

One caveat to note  this is a big beer. I wouldnt be serving this to any beer newbies. You need a developed appreciation for beer before you should tackle this giant.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

2854,"2010-12-10",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2014 From a 330ml bottle on 8/12/2010. Pours dark brown and cloudy, with some yeast sediment floating around. The aroma is raisins, plums, port and a touch of chocolate. Surprisingly, its relatively straight forward flavour wise. Dark fruit dominates, and its extremely sweet - a real dessert beer. Its also quite smooth and drinkable for a beer thats 11.3%, thought he alcohol comes to the fore when it warms up. The carbonation is low and it finishes with a modest bitterness. Very nice, though perhaps a tad over-rated. Rating 3.9.

Re-rate on 24/3/2014. Thought it was time to give this another try but on doing so, I remain thoroughly perplexed at the ridiculously high rating for this. Dont get me wrong - its nice enough but its falls a very long way short of being great. It lacks a bit of complexity and this bottle was over carbed.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Maris"

Right away I know Rochefort 10 is an impressive beer. A plethora of delicious flavors immediately charm you. Dark fruits as mentioned in the smell, also including molasses, toffee, and oak.

Perfectly balanced with carbo, yeast and other ingredients.
And dangerous, too delicious and taste no alcohol.","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"
2854,"2010-10-03",4.7,"A- Poured into my Snifter dark brown, woody in colour. Somewhat Cloudy. Nice creamy head with Decent Lacing. Thick look to it as it poured but it did not pour thick which was unexpected.

S- Earthy, very natural smell to it. Can really pick up the malts they smell very roasted. Very Dark caramel, almost sweet hints with some Vanilla. Can pick up the hops in the back as well they smell very floral. Very Enjoyable

T- Wow, so much flavour in one drink. Very sweet taste to it. The Malt flavour is so wonderful, very roasted but not overpowering at all. The Dark Caramel flavour comes out here very much, but the flavour is perfectly balanced with the hops. They are full of flavour here, floral and earthy with very little bitterness. As I drink flavours of dried fruits (Raisins, Apricots) comes through. Very nice to detect very little Yeast flavour. As the drink warms I can also taste alcohol is isnt surprising cause its 11.3%. Also as it warms a nice bitterness becomes prevalent which compliments the sweetness it started with very well.

M- Very very smooth and creamy. Wonderful to swirl around and let it sit in my mouth. The warming from the alcohol is also very invited and makes the whole experience very different, but I like it.

D- I love this beer. Way different than what I was expecting so that was nice. Everything about this beer seems to compliment it. The sweet and bitter, the colour, smell. Everything is in balance with the beer. As it warms the feeling changes to going from the sweet to the bitter and warming more and more. One of the best beer experiences Ive had as of yet.","Ontario, CANADA","case4816"

I wish the taste would have that light vanilla-like freshness that the aroma has. But instead it is very intensive: lots of sugar, prunes, sweet malt. I think its a bit too heavy for me to fully enjoy. I can see the appeal here though. 2015 re-rate: 2013-12 bottle, almost two years old. Chestnut brown body; the first pour is almost semi-clear now. Later pours are well murky. Aroma is still incredible with lots of toffee, vanilla and dried berries. Along with other Rocheforts, this is one of the best smelling beers that Ive had! Taste is not too much different from the fresh bottles - cellared samples (this one and some older bottles that Ive had) seem to have a less alcoholic and more rounded taste. The influence of oxidation is small and the carbonation level seems unchanged. This is definitely a good beer to cellar.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","thirstyrabbit"

2854,"2010-09-25",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2013 330 ml bottle. Rated @ 27.4.2009.
Deep brown colour with a long lasting brown head. Very fruity on the nose with raisins, Belgian yeast and banana. Same thing on the flavour too; banana, alcohol and caramel all in a good balance. Sweet, dry and warming finish. Excellent.
Rating after numerous 6 month, 1 year, 2 year and 3 year old vintages.
So, finally I manage to write a compilation of all the (vintage) ratings Ive rated of this beer. If it ages, it gets better. But only for the first two years. After that the sweetness takes over, the fruitiness disappears and the yeast gets rather boring really. If you want to taste this at its best, have a 2 year old vintage. Its settles down nicely and brings you the best R10 experience. A 1 year old vintage is a bit raw, and the yeast is slightly overwhelming. Nevertheless, the blackcurrant notes on 1 year old vintage are just awesome, as on the 2 year old vintage. Honestly, this is much better than W12, in aroma, flavour, price and overall-wise.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"

2854,"2010-09-19",3.9,"Pours a very dark reddish brown. The aroma is packed with bold notes of plums, raisins, and yeast. The flavor is likewise a bold combination of dark fruits that is easily the most potent of any of the quads or Belgian strong dark ales that I have tried. The flavor starts getting quite sweet as the beer warms, though, and the texture is largely unremarkable and does not provide any relief from the sweet fruitiness of the flavor.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"
2854,"2010-09-16",4.6,"(11.2oz bottle).  This bottle is 2 years old.  Pours muddy brown with a tan head.  I poured the entire contents into the glass rather than leaving the yeasty leftovers because I had a gushing issue.  Aroma has lots of caramel and milk chocolate to go with some butterscotch.  Maybe even some caramel corn.  Taste is malty sweet (but not as malty as when its fresh).  Most of the hops have subsided as well.  Full bodied and creamy/sticky texture.  Finish is smooth and the alcohol is warming.  This is a superb beer-truly world class.

The initial taste I get is of sweet dark fruit...raisins....even some grapes. This is followed by a very thick brown sugar/molasses taste that goes through the body and into the finish. The high ABV is certainly noticeable on the finish, but could certainly be worse considering what the ABV is. It does cause a bit of astringency on the swallow, though. Some sweetness hangs around after the swallow, but all in all seems pretty dry.","USA","NODAK1979"

The flavour is of toffee and dried fruits.
The complex middle brings caramell, light roasted malt,, citrus, raisins and spice along.
Finish is spicy, warming up alcoholy and dry which remain in a spicy aftertaste.
In spite of the high ABV, its relatively easy drinakble and the alcohols not pushing in front.

Subtle sweetness with spicy and creamy notes, as well as notes of alcohol in the background. As it warms, citrus notes blends with the creamy notes giving notions of lemon jello with whipped cream. Didnt find the aroma really fantastic in itself (the different notes), although still good, but its well-balanced and has no flaws, which makes for extra points. Full-bodied flavour which is dominated by the alcohol, although it still manages to hide the realatively high content. Sweetish and with notes of hops behind the alcohol. Some brandy-like similarities as it warms. Finish is sweetish with notes of alcohol and lingering dry hop and citrus notes.

The smell I got hints of raisins, some chocolate (the again my nose isnt very expert in this), the taste gave was kind of sweet with the presence of the raisins, a little bit nutty, alcohol was very present in the taste (thats the only thing that threw me off a little bit) the again its a 11.4% ABV, I got also some carbonation feel.

I would have again (but in fall or winter, it was a little bit hot yesterday, lol)

Excellent carbonation and I barely noticed the high alcohol content. It tastes a bit like some imperial stouts that Ive have. I was extremely impressed with the taste. It was kind of burnt and smoky, and it had a pleasant, bitter aftertaste.  It really doesnt get much better than this, which explains why this beer is so expensive.","Virginia, USA","QuezXLV"

A very complex and amazing Quad from Rochefort.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"

Pours a deep brownish-purpleish-red, and smells like plum, vanilla, childrens cough medicine, and a little potpourri.  Very enticing. Then the taste comes and its perhaps one of the best Belgians I ever put my lips on.  Theres tones of vanilla, plum, raisin,  molasses, candy sugar, with a full rich velvety body, sweet with a mildly bitter aftertaste.  Loads of vanilla and dark fruit, on a huge body.

I went ahead and dumped most of the yeast into the beer since its a Belgium Quad. A nice light brown head leaves good lacing. It smells of sour fruits and earthiness with a lot of yeast esters and alcohol.

I get a lot alot of alcohol warm immediately with dark fruit flavors that have a bit of sweetness. But this is my no means a sweet beer, there is enough bitterness in the back end to keep it balanced. This is my first Quad so I dont have much to compare it to. Carbonation is on the high side, giving it bit of a champagne-like quality. Definitely a dry beer that doesnt leave much after its hit the tongue.","Vista, California, USA","rcubed"
2854,"2010-06-13",4.1,"This is a remarkable beer that deserves all the recognition given to it.  Without doubt a top ten.  Its an autumnal brown and wears a lovely fluffy head that lows to a lacing that goes on and on.  A swirl reinvigorates the head and leaves a pattern on the glass that remains throughout.  The nose is roasted brown sugar, caramel, a bit of spice and some alcohol.  This beer is heaven in your mouth.  It covers everything in a thick honey texture and leaves a heat at the back of the throat, reminding us of its 11.3% ABV.  But a beer like this needs a little heat.  Taste is of brown sugar, malt, sunny figs and oozy dates.  There are raisins, some banana like notes and a bit of a earthy or grassy hops in there for good measure.  Mainly its the Belgian candy sugar that wins out, going on for a superbly long finish.  A true classic that guarantees I will not be the first, nor the last, to consider a monastic life if it means getting closer to this heavenly creation.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

Pours an opaque dark brown colour, with lively carbonation and a nice lasting white head. The sediment doesnt fall to the bottom of the glass, but stays in there floating. Funny. 

The scent is, like most quads, very complex. A bit like sour cherry, alcohol, spicy yeast, and above all, fruits. 

The taste is very similar to the smell, but went above and beyond. Incredibly complex. Wow wow wow. What a beer. Roasted and caramel malts, chocolate, fruits (plums, raisins and maybe some citrus??), mildly spicy yeast and some tones of alcohol (surprisingly low for a beer with more than 11% alcohol content). 

The mouthfeel is fantastic too. Rich and creamy, impressively balanced. Medium-high carbonation.

Raisins, plums, figs and dates are all in there. Also some licorice, spices and just a hint of yeast. Taste is not as sweet as I expected, finishes rather dry. No appaerant bitterness. Warming alcohol, but still smooth mouthfeel, though not creamy. All those dark fruits lingers in the aftertaste for a while. Body is medium, thinner than I thought. A solid beer!

The flavor is the best of the three, alcohol hidden very well and is smooth as can be, this is the best Belgium beer ive had in a long time, would have to compare with Chimay blue and St. Bernardus Abt. 12 side by side, but right now this is perfect.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
2854,"2010-04-21",3.7,"Poured into my Chimay chalice. Had this a few weeks ago and decided to post my notes today.

A- Dark cloudy brown body with bright red hues where the light strikes it. A beautiful tan creamy head fades rather quickly and does leave behind a nice collar. Some bubbles can be seen rising to the top and little to no lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Nose is strong of dark fruit-particularly grapes and cherries with hints of chocolate and sugar.

T- A well balanced dose of cherry, chocolate, grapes, and sugar is upfront with a big malt backbone. Very sweet and reminiscent of cherry cola or root beer with chocolate. The finish is as complex as the initial taste with a big phenolic taste added to the mix. What lingers is a big alcohol afterburn and some sugary sweetness.

P- Amazing and one of the best mouthfeels I have ever experienced. Medium carbonation with the creamiest body that has ever come across my palate.

O- This is overall a decent beer. Great complexity and mouthfeel but it isnt amazing like I thought it would be. I do like it but it is not one of my favorite brews and I was slightly disappointed by this. The big alcohol presence makes the drinkability average. This is borderline barleywine. I would have this one again but I am not in love with it.

2854,"2010-04-19",4.5,"This poured a very cloudy and sediment rich brown, with almost three fingers worth of foam on top. The lacing is very sticky and rich. Aroma brings up notes of dried dark fruit such as prunes or even figs though the only complaint is that they are not particularly strong. Taste gives a warm mixture of dates, raisins and even a bit of the belgian signature candy sugar. Of course, the sweetness is kept to a check and not overdone as is more common with the lighter belgian ales. On the aftertaste, there is a distinct taste of caramelized malt in addition to just a touch of  alcohol. The alcohol becomes a bit more noticeable as the beer warms up.

Really unbelievable silky, soft, smooth mouth feel, and the 11% is only noticed as a warming sensation after the sip. Full bodied with a fair a little less carbonation than expected but still noticeable.  Taste reveals at first a spiced bite of candied fruits, which progress to a very long finish that begins with a molasses feel, then goes to fruits, but possesses at some points a sort of dryness but ultimately leaves the breathe of plum and raisin.

2854,"2010-04-16",4.3,"330 mL bottle from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, served in a Trappist glass. A young bottle, expiry 01-10-13. Pours cloudy mahogany with a small tan head.

Flavour is sweet throughout, with a lingering peppery alcohol finish. On the palate, medium-full in body with a syrupy texture and lively carbonation. Quite astringent. As the carbonation settles, it becomes fairly smooth. Overall, another excellent beer from the monks at Abbaye Saint-Rémy. It is an incredibly complex, ethereal beer with beautiful malts and an aroma that beckons from across the room. Definitely one to savour. More aromatic and complex than Rochefort 8; fruitier, at the expense of floral notes. Stands up to Westvleteren 12.

Aroma of caramel malts, dark fruits (plums, raisins, figs, cherries), cream, yeast, candi sugar, alcohol, and a little bit of a metallic note.  Nicest aroma of the three- best balanced, by far.  Flavor of sweet caramel malts, candi sugar, dark fruits (same as above), yeast, cola, alcohol, and the same metallic note I picked up on in the aroma and flavor of the 8 and 10.  Maybe thats the kind of thing that would settle out over time, and this was a 2009 vintage.

2854,"2010-02-25",4.8,"This is one of the behemoths of the beer world. A monolith in the art of brewing. One of the absolutely best beers from Belgium, if not the world. Trappist ale Rochefort 10 was one of the first truly awesome beers I ever tasted, and one of those seminal drinking experiences truly opening my eyes to the world of Belgian monastic brewing and its intricate mysteries. It pours a deep caramel brown which turns almost black in the glass, with a thin off-white head. Rochefort 10 smells like a whole treasury of flavor, all blended exquisitely: raisins, plums, figs, bread, grapes, booze and bakery yeast. The aroma and taste follows: delicious dark malts and a rich tapestry of various fruit and hops, delicately wrapped in a significant layer of alcohol - Rochefort 10 is one of those beers intentionally using alcohol as an integral part of the overall flavor. And it works for me; this monastery ale weighs in at 11,3 % ABV, warming my body up with each jagged little sip of pleasure. Mmmmm. This is what a full-bodied beer is all about. The only reason I dont give it the full score is due to its matchup with ""big brother"" Westvleteren 12, which manages to take me all the way to beer heaven.

2854,"2010-02-19",4.5,"11.2oz bottle that Ive been sitting on for about 2 years. Pours a cloudy, brown colored body with an amber tint to it. Just a few trace pieces of sediment. Finger-width, creamy and frothy, tan head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is much richer than either the 6 or 8. Tons of deep caramels, chocolate, and toffee. There are also heaps of dark fruits to accompany the vast array of malts. Not as floral as the 6 or 8, but loaded with prunes, raisins, dates, plums, and definitely some black currants and other black berries. A bit of a syrupy sweetness, banana bread, thick yeasts, and some peppery alcohol. Very big, thick, dense, and complex aroma. Flavor is more the same. Heaps of caramel and chocolate, dark fruits, and some molasses-bread. Raisins, dates, prunes, plums, and a nice berry-like, black currant taste with just a pinch of sharpness. Syrupy sweetness with some more banana bread, peppery spices, nuts, earth, and a somewhat salty alcohol. Finishes rich, warm, and layered with a solid bitterness that slowly dries with a lengthy aftertaste. Full body, very smooth, and a soft, creamy carbonation. Overall, I tasted the 6, 8, and 10 side-by-side and I wanted to like the 6 or 8 more than the 10. I was HOPING this beer was overrated, but this beer is awesome. Big, soft, rich, and complex, I have nothing to complain about here. This beer is spectacular and anything but overrated. Wow.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

The taste is again full of everything from figs, black currant, plum, raisin, candy, and alcohol.  The finish is long with a full body, a sticky texture, a fizzy carbonation, that is not too much.

The beer looks even great at the glasses that are specially made for it. Normally ive always Rochefort 10 at my home, but still, I only drink it at special occassions like a birthday, or if I had a REALLY good day. I wont ruin the taste by drinking it like on a regular base. This beer is one you mostly just love or hate... some of my friends dont like it at all... 

Edit: Tasted at 2 oct. 2010 a bottle from 7 years old. Dark redish, small head that leaves a lace. Very nice fruity-sweet, caramel smell. Caramel comes up even more then at a fresh bottle. Like the smell for sure. A bit darker red coloured substance it seems. Very nice sweetness, the fruits still comes up so nice, but its a bit earthy-dusty cause the age. Red fruits and caramel comes up some more. This beer ages beautifully for sure.","BERMUDA","Abio"

Some earth/ forest floor smells too. Taste starts sweet and then explodes.

A little tartness and some residual yeasty bubbles combine to leave no thick sweetness at the end, just lingering flavours and aromas. A lot of things and yet just itself. Beautiful. [4.5] This one is even better - lovely thick head that lasts in a Trappist glass and laces beautifully. So big, but so easygoing. Complex and harmonious.

It poured dark, blurish brown with a fine forming and lasting beige head. Some uniform carbonation at the bottom. 

The aroma flew into me right at the opening (as did Rochefort 6s aroma) with pomegranate, plum, some raisins, oat, wheat, bread and a few dried dark fruits. 

As I turned it into my mouth, the strong licorous taste, such as a ruby wine, got all over my mouth with no shame of the alcohol it beared. Berries, wood, some clove, little banana, fading coriander and a hole lot of raisin and dark dried fruits sweetness. The bitterness came up slowly and fading with the aftertaste.

Altough it is unbalanced to the sweet, it only bothers in higher temperatures. This beer must be drank at the right temperature - if its lower, the alcohol comes ou too much, if its higher, theres too much sugar. But, at the right temperature, the right aromas and tastes flourish grealty.

App.:  Very, very deep brown with a large tan head.

Palate:  Medium+ body with moderate effervescence and a few sharp bubbles.
  
Flav.:  A little nutty, quite sweet and fruity, plenty of minty herbals, molasses, a bit of vanilla, wood and rum-like flavours, the fruits lend themselves a bit more towards berries than dark dried fruits, some light yeast notes, definitely some alcohol; fairly sweet with enough bitterness to balance, quite a bit of warming, almost stinging alcohol and a pleasant licorice/molasses/wood/sherry finish.

2854,"2009-11-02",4.4,"The brew is a very elegant looking one with an opaque, brown coloring. You can still see the yeast in the bottle seeing as it is bottle-brewed. The head does also last quite a while in a nice off-white tint. This is a very complicated brew though. The smell was a mix of pretty much everything and I couldnt pinpoint one single thing. It had hops and yeast in the nose as well as being a little sweet, though. The first taste is the taste of air in the carbonation followed by a brown sugar taste. There is also a very prevalent taste of the hops in the brew and an alcoholic ending that was evident, but not overpowering. The texture was all you could hope for in a brew like this.

Apperance is a thick dark brown, and poured a two finger head which held up on a vigorous pour.

Aroma was very complex, in the end the earthy and oaky smells were dominant accompanied by some limited fruit tones. There was also a distinct traditional Ale yeast smell to the beer.

Taste was very well balanced. The earthy/oaky aroma was noticeable in the taste, along with some sweet fruity flavors. You never lose track that this is an ale, with the yeast in balance and control of the flavor. There is very limited if any hops flavor, and balanced bitterness at the end.

Mouthfeel was unexpectedly think and somewhat dry. Very pleasant.

In order of decreasing prominence: Dark fruit, alchohol, leather, cigar smoke, licorice/aniseed. Ripe fruit is more prominent in flavour. Vanilla becomes present. Very thick and warming.

2854,"2009-09-23",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2010 The 330 ml bottle pours quickly with its long thin neck, leaving a sizable tan head.  The large head dissipated quickly, leaving a short layer of small durable bubbles and a fair amount of lacing.  The body of the beer is quite dark, but reveals a rich copper hue when held to light.  The nose is complex.  Earthy and musty aromas mix with caramel and molasses notes.  There is also a strong alcohol component.  Palate entry is dry and lively, but there is a strong malt backbone giving the beer a medium to full body.  Mid-palate and finish reveal expected dried fruit flavors:  fig, raisin, prune and date; but, there also is a hint of clove.

If you like the yeast the clarity is sacrificed (ive had it both ways and both is tasty) medium to strong carbonation at first but I let it sit for about 10-15 before pouring.  Aroma really is bubble gum and caramel with slight alcohol scent.  Flavor remains slight bubble gum at first and then turns to caramel, then raisin, then finishes chocolate.  Very complex.

Flavours are quite sweet: candi sugar, caramel, golden syrup, figs. Silky alcohol merges with a light bitterness to create an impressive finish that builds up in the first few seconds after swallowing.

2854,"2009-09-01",4.2,"A: Poured with a large, off-white head... that surprisingly diminished to about 1/4 finger size over a minute or two. Body is cloudy and murky, with a dark brown color. Some lacing, but not as much as Id expect.

S: Aroma is of some light, bready yeast, clove, and light alcohol as well. Some other things in there I cant put my finger on, but very pleasant overall.

T: Wow... lightly sweet at the beginning, with spices present (cloves?). Continues to change as it finishes slightly warm due to the high alcohol content. Taste stays for a long time and continues to kick.

M: Full-bodied and creamy, with average carbonation. Excellent.

2854,"2009-08-25",4.0,"First impression is a very positive one as a very nice thick white head forms.  It is controlled, and not the head bomb I have seen in several belgians.  Liquid is a very dark and murky, muddy brown.  A little backstory, out of the big three quads, this is the only that I have never tried.  I much prefer Bernardus to Westy, in this style anyway.  Lets see where this one stacks up.  In the aroma department, we are looking complex.  Dark fruit, floral characters, grapes, banana, and light breadiness over booze.  A good scent that reminds me of something in between the Westy 8 and 12.  Extremely complex, but very welcoming.  Taste is surprisingly good, already ahead of the overly clovey Westy in my book.  Not overpowering but immense and complex in its own right, Rochefort 10 starts clean with a lot of the characteristics of the aroma dancing around the palate, most notably dark fruit.  This isnt as heavy as the Westy, but no less complex.  Palate is medium to thick in body, medium to high in carbonation.  Extremely impressed with this one.  Ill have to do a side by side with Bernardus 12 to see which I prefer in the end, though initial thoughts is that Rochefort is the more fulfilling beer.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"

Now, I really do enjoy a Belgian style beer, but this one had something different going on with it.  It certainly had a strange murky looking body - a dark raisin brown with a lot of sediment hanging around in the glass.  It had a small light brown head as well.  Aroma was really fantastic.  Certainly a lot of dark fruits, rum-raisin, plums, dates, sweet brown sugar... Taste was quite a bit like wine...but not really?  I dont know, it was almost like a cola, very carbonated and it had a bit of a syrupy mouthfeel.  Overall, it was definitely a good beer.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","MereLikesBeer"

On the palate dark coca, roasted malt, tawny port (not to be confused with ruby!) and reduced calorie maple syrup. Body is a little on the thin side but it enhances the drinkability.

The carbonation is rather lively on the palate.  Again, the taste is very plumy and the other dark fruits are very noticeable.

I was surprised by the nose. The aromas were more of dark fruits like cassis, plum, dark cherries, and raisins. I was expecting more maltiness, brown sugar, and molasses. Pleasantly surprised. The mouth feel was my favorite part of the beer. Rich and creamy with impeccable balance. For 11.3% the alcohol flavors are almost non existent. I think this bottle was young though, because the complexities were not quite there yet. Still a wonderful brew. Great experience. Drank next to a Avery Reverend (quad as well).

2854,"2009-07-10",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2011 7/10/2009: Pours cloudy dark brown with lively carbonation and a lasting off-white head.  Considerable yeast at bottom.  Aroma is sour cherry, alcohol, yeast, apple, soggy toast.  Very carbonated feel.  Burnt, especially in the finish. Considerable alcohol, with those dark fermented fruit tastes infused slightly.  Finish is fairly short, little bitterness.  Bit of banana.  I think of the concept of darkness when I drink this beer.  Perhaps Ill turn the light off.  Now I think of silence, so I turn the music off.  This is a beer of muted senses, belittlement beneath a vast black sky of stars.  A deeper swig reveals a more complex flavor with fruits coming through in the middle. Once the alcohol begins to hit you, the flavors and the aroma dissolve together into a very favorable final impression.   I like it, but I would still says it does not live up to my expectation- perhaps I do not enjoy a good quad as much as a stout.  Still excellent beer.  Update 10/21/2010:  This has since become one of my all-time favorite beers, and Ive been on a quest to brew it.  It is the breadiness (found more clearly in the 8) that makes this beer so wonderful and appetizing.

Pours like a good root beer - 2-finger frothy, velvety head with nice lacing. Good carbonation. Not so thick its opaque, rather a little translucent.

Spice profile is surprisingly subtle - needs to warm/open up. Mellow molasses aroma mixes with yeast & malt. Some ginger emerges.

Everything on the nose comes out in a well-balanced, mellow package - a little ginger, hearty yeast and malt without any bitter taste or comforting stuff. Extremely well-balanced - like a warm blanket on a camping trip.

Feels like soothing ginger beer with very mild carbonation. Delightful, relaxing mouthfeel.

2854,"2009-06-04",4.9,"Easily the best beer Ive tried. Light and refreshing. Pleasantly carbonated despite the dark color. Doesnt sit too heavy, so definitely lends to drinking multiples. I wish they sold it near me. Id probably be a poor man though.","Alabama, USA","bacummings"
2854,"2009-06-03",4.4,"Pours a dark dark brown with a bit of head and seems to be nicely carbonated.  Big full bodied quad here.  I am getting banana, candied fruit, some malt and spices on the nose.  It seems though as it is warming up there are more nuances coming through.  On the palate I am getting all the fruit(berries, plum, raisins) that nuance of banana in there as well, along with some nice spice flavors.  Also some orange peel on the finish there.  Excellent Quad, highly recommended.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","beerandIT"
2854,"2009-06-03",4.4,"Pours a dark brown with a lasting off-white head and appears to be highly carbonated. The smell is overwhelming: brown sugar, dark malts, cinnamon, coffee, this beer has everything. And even though it sits at 11.3% alcohol it can not be picked out by the nose. The taste is pure heaven and very smooth to boost; it is dark, hops-filled, with brown sugar notes... it is extremely complex. Overall the beer works wonderfully and I would recommend to anyone.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
2854,"2009-06-02",4.8,"WOW!!!!!!! What a great beer. This beer was amazing, the only problem I had with it is I didnt get enough three of us had to split one bottle. The beer poured very dark very little light penetration when held up to the light, with a creamy head that disappeared quickly. The strong scent of bananas and other sweet fruit starts the mouth watering in anticipation of the first sip. I found the feel in my mouth to be so very soft and full like whole cream blankating my mouth, but it still was very smooth. The first tast was way sweet and malty. There was a strong flavor of banana that covered up a minty taste in the background. The after taste was bitter but very short-lived. I love this beer, I just cant buy it here dammit.""","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"

Over all a great beer but not something that I want to drink all of the time. I enjoyed the 8 much better.","","Bierkrug"

2854,"2009-05-29",4.9,"Best beer Ive ever had - no question - even better than Old Style Pilsner. Even better now that I can appreicate beer more. Simply amazing. Almost a port. Hard to judge the head considering this most recent tasting was a three way split, but nice brown none the less. Get ready to be punched in the face with the aroma of fruits - plums, apricots, bananas(??)and the most interesting hops ever. Aromas softened during carefully sipping trying to avoid polising it in one shot, but it defenetly got way more complex along the way with the fragrence of bananas holding out strong. Had a zippy bitterness to it with great carbonation. Found a decent collection of sediment at the bottom of the glass. Felt like a thousand hot supple blonde chicks on my tongue. I need a towel. This is the real thing. One of the greatest beers on the planet.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Pours murky dark brown with a nice beige colored head. Nose has great balance, raisin esters supported by choc/caramel malt with some spicy phenolics as well. Palate is full and creamy. Raisin, choc & caramel malt all have great synergy. Nothing sticks out of place to dominate. Finishes with significant belgian yeast spice. Brilliant balance and mouthfeel despite big abv! Hops and alcohol an afterthought. This sample was quite fresh and in top nick. Easy to see why this is a classic, but to be honest i think i prefer the 8. Regardless, awesome beer!

Pours a dark brown/mahogany color with a huge tan bubbly head that lingers through the duration of the beer. I have never seen a beer pour like this before... it was quite impressive. It also had a good amount of carbonation that continuously bubbled from the bottom of my glass. The aroma was very complex and consisted of plum, raisins, grapes, malt, and some booze. The taste was a wonderful mix of dark dried fruit, plum, raisins, malt, with a slight alcohol warming in the background. It had a medium bodied mouth feel and left a nice lingering taste of plum and dark fruit. Overall, an exceptional beer!

Wow, flavor is strong alcohol, I may be drinking this at too warm a temperature. Spice and raisins are still there, but the alcohol overwhelmed that first sip.  A follow up gives a hint of anice and spice, but the alcholol still pervades.  Very warm boozy finish, not as well disguised as I would have hoped for.

I was stoked for this beer, I thought I might have over hyped it a bit in my mind. But no, this stuff is the bees knees of quadrupels. The aroma is deep and complex, lots of anise and licorice, with big fruit notes, lots of dried cherry, grape, and plum. The flavour is equally as complex, a light touch of licorice at first which seems to be the throne of that all the other flavours of this beer sit on, plum, raisin, a bit of black currant tartness, brown sugar,  ends on a big licorice note.

Sour apple, brown sugar, licorine and perhaps even some well hidden citrus near the finish. Palate did not make any attempt to hide alcohol, but has a nice spice filled finish.

Pours a murky, rich dark purplish-brown, with a magnificent, pillowy two-finger khaki head on top. The head reduces to a thick, creamy khaki cap that leaves substantial lacing. Very nice.

Nose is hard to get a grip on - nutty, bit of cocoa, primarily brown sugar, spicy dark fruit, and doughy yeast. Whats there is fantastic.

Taste is full, rich, complex, and yet perfectly in sync with itself, if that makes sense. Notes of cocoa and spiced brown sugar, raisins and dates, doughy, spicy yeast, with a mild earthy bitterness coming out to join the fray right before the finish. Finish is sweet, spicy, yeast with some sweet raisin notes. Fairly short finish, warming, just a bit of alcohol underneath. Subtle but big in flavor, all while being very approachable.

Mouthfeel is creamy and fluffy, perfectly executed, full mouthfeel without being syrupy.

But the one I tasted was definitely not the best beer I have ever had as so many have claimed. It is quite possible that the bottle I got my hands on was damaged goods and not representative of the quality that is usually found. To test this theory I will gladly try another (or two) to be sure. There was definitely more sediment in this bottle than I have seen in any other beer; not sure if that indicates a problem or is normal for this particular beer.

Bready, chocolate malt and yeast nose. Dried fruit: raisin and prune, caramel dates. Fresh fruits include plum and boysenberry. Spices of clove and pepper, compliment subtle aromas of whiskey and oak. 
Flavours are full of alcohol which successfully transmit raisin, prune and overripe strawberries throughout the palate. Vinous tones seem to cling to the tongue. 
Mild spices of clove and aniseed with a golden syrup sweetness. 
Before and during the finish I found a bitterness of black coffee, which introduces a mellow, bready yeast.

2854,"2009-01-29",3.9,"(bottle) Well, I finally got around to rating this one.  Pours dark brown with an off-white head and adequate lacing.  Aroma of walnut and light chocolate, with a significant amount of alcohol.  Warming reveals stronger scents of chocolate and light yeast, but nothing else.  Not really impressed with the aroma.  The taste is a different story however, and is a complete 180 from the aroma.  The flavor begins with plenty of dark fruits like plum and raisin, which then switches to chocolate, light wine, and finishing out with toasted walnut and bready yeast that really lingers well after drinking.  All in all, a good beer, but the aroma wasnt impressive, and the beer itself was overcarbonated.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Beautiful, complex Belgian with strong dark fruit notes- plum/prune stands out the most to me.  Somewhat inconsistent (availability and quality) in the States but ill blame that on the shipping/distribution rather than the monks.

2854,"2009-01-24",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2009 Aroma is dark candied fruits, somewhat figgy, with some apple pie. Color is an opaque dark brown. Flavor is so powerful when cold that it actually tingles against the tongue. Nutmeg, clove, yeast, raisins, red wine, orange peel, cinnamon, overripe banana, and malt hit my tongue as well as alcohol. The candied dark fruits and banana were the strongest; the beer is both hard-hitting and sweet. A little too powerful and sugary when cold. My guess is that it is nicer with age, but as it warmed it became very palatable and appealing--the flavors somehow blend magically together with a bit less chill. When it was too cold I was feeling a bit irritated about all the hype over this beer, but at the right temperature it makes sense. A true trappist, and Id say one of the best.

Aroma is of caramel, dark sugar, cherries, dried plums, raspberry, straw, white tea, lots of raisin, juicy fruit gum, grass, a little citrus, straw, funky grain, melon, earth... You could go on forever finding new aroma notes in this beer. Flavor is just as complex and fantastically good. Toasted grain, dark caramel, earthy dried leaves, plum, apple, tons of floral hops, citrus potpourri, molasses, walnuts, old burlap, straw, very light cinamon, rye bread, candi sugar, wet late season hay fields, earthy and herbal hops toward the finish, again I could go on but am reaching the end of the bottle.

Dark brown pour with a head that seems to generate more and more foam.  Tangy and sweet aroma, with some coffee and herbs too.  Great mouthfeel that is velvet with some fizz and tingle in the finish.  Tastes sweet and fruity up front, with prune, pear, and cherry fading to a hoppy molasses tingle.  A lot of different flavors, but they all seem to blend together into one.  This is definitely a treat, but it is a tad too sugary to be in my top 10. Thanks again, Ratebeer.","USA","Slipstream"

The amount of flavor with raisins, sugar, malt, and still grape (though it could be black currant), plus how tingly it is on the tongue (gotta love that effervescence).

2854,"2008-10-04",4.0,"Purchased 3 yrs ago - 1st rainy day seemed like a good day for this.
Pours a gorgeous deep deep mahogany with garnet highlights and a fluffy long lasting tan head leaving nice lace on the glass.
First thing I noticed is the big hiss on opening .. the yeast have been working
Nose: Plum, figs, some licorice, bready notes along with white pepper and way way deep in the background is a whiff of alcohol along with a touch of old ale like vinous qualities.
Taste: Lots of rich malt notes including caramel dark fruits and tons of spicy notes leaning towards white pepper. For the malt complexity this beer finishes dry. The palate is a little overwhelmed by the carbonic bite and the hugely warming alcohol
Mouthfeel: The higher than expected carbonation makes the beer more dry than expected and does not have a luxuriating finish which the nose hinted
Overall: Stuff of legends in the nose (with a such a big alcohol % hidden so well) maybe my bottle got over carbonated. The taste complexity was there but the high carbonation was a quite distracting. Once I drove out the CO2 the magic  - maybe my bottle was slightly over carbonated. While the huge alcohol makes this a sipper the rich flavors and super dry finish make the sips closer (Caveat: The floor can get uneven very quickly)","USA","luvcasks"

There is a lot of dark caramelly malt sweetness and alcohol--no roastedness or hop bitterness--with soft fruitiness and spicy fermentation characteristics.  The body is quite light and is dominated by alcohol.

I fell in love with Rochefort after being served it in a pub in the Grand Place in Brussels (it happened to be the first of the trip).  I asked the waiter which beer he liked and he said the 10 was too strong for him (poof).  In the space of about 30/40 minutes Id worked my way through the whole range and got a funky afternoon buzz on.  

Everything about it screams quality; from the name and label, to the glass its served in, to the aroma and taste.

Visually it reminded me of the murky, filthy, mud puddles we loved jumping around in as kids, and this beer produced the exact same feeling of euphoria.

A deeply inviting aroma; caramelised sugar, cocoa, malt and hints orange zest.  The zest transfers to the palate and is pleasantly fizzy for this style of beer.  The alcohol is conspicuous in the aroma but much less so in the taste; if werent for the delightful buzz im getting id swear blind it wasnt 11.3%.  Melted galaxy chocolate, freshly baked mixed fruitcake with a persistent aftertaste. For the first time i can feel comfortable saying there is a party in my mouth.

Flavor is again strong on dark fruits, lots of raisin and red grape, some cocoa and red apple, some mild berry notes, clove, and other spice notes.

2854,"2008-07-26",4.4,"Pours dark hazy brown with some residual yeast at the bottom. Head is frothy and copious, forming a lasting one finger head. Aromas are quite evident upon pouring. I was all but knocked back by the sweetness of the scent- tons are dark fruit coming in from every angle. Plum, raisin, currant, and cherry mix with a heavenly sweetness to invoke a humbling sensation. Banana and clove poke through as well as some molasses and ginger. Flavor is bursting with dark sugars and a plethora of fruity notes. Molasses, ripened berry, banana, plum and raisin. Flavors grow more multifaceted and intricate as the ale warms and sits. Malt character is of the utmost complexity, as different flavors are pelted in from all angles. With every sip comes a new flavor- currant, caramel, biscuit and allspice. Palate is modest, but incredibly smooth. Thick and rich, yet wholly drinkable. Tiny bubbles of carbonation caress the tongue and mouth, but dont act to intrude or lacerate. Sweetness coats the mouth in a resinous fashion, slowly dissipating into a dry but pleasant finish. Highly sweet but never cloying. Alcohol is present and noticeable, but never intrusive or overly aggressive. A warming characteristic acts as a reminder of its presence, but just as fleeting and moderate.

The taste is much like the aroma but has a much bigger Belgian yeast flavor that then gives way to huge dark fruit flavors along with a bit of brown sugar and caramel.

Pours a deep brown, or even purple-ish color, quickly dissipating off-white head. Looking at the beer for the first time, I wondered whether my Trappist glass had been severely soiled since I washed it only minutes earlier; no! it was simply the yeast and sediment chunks gracefully settling on the bottom. First sip was like liquid ecstasy. Brown sugar, dark fruits as have been previously mentioned. Perfectly carbonated and each sip yields a different experience. For being 11.3%, this is the smoothest, most drinkable beer I’ve ever tasted. As close to perfection as I’ve come.

Belgium notes of malts, yeast and a backdrop of fruit tones. Pretty complex and carbonated as well...fun watching the bubbles.  Really fine beer and world class in my book.

Thick foamy notches of lacing after almost each sip.  The aroma shows smoke, plums, figs, alcohol, its not overly strong but does have subtle complexities.  Flavors are rich and smooth.  Lots of black licorice along with brown sugar, complex dark fruit character, notes of caramel and a spicy semi-alcoholic finish.  Very warming.  Excellent beer.  Gets a little bump with this rate.  Original rate:  I have been looking for this beer for quite some time and finally found it at Brawleys Beverage while passing through Charlotte, NC. Pours a murky deep brown color topped with a moderate head for the style. A thin, foamy head sticks around the whole time. Aroma is plums, alcohol, spicy malts and some brown sugar. Toasty malty flavor followed by dark fruits, nuts, some alcohol heats it up in the middle and finishes spicy with strong black licorice.

The ""commercial"" description of ""Strong plum, raisin, and black currant"" pretty much nails it.  There is a sweetness to it but it is nice and mellow, not sweet like you would think.  There is also a very subtle bitterness to it that is not even close to over powering.  Very nicely balanced.  This truly is an extremely unique beer that is a treat to drink.

2854,"2008-06-13",4.0,"THOUGHTS: It wasnt as good as I was expecting at first, from all Ive heard about this one. But it was still a really nice beer. And it got better as it warmed.. Hid alcohol  incredibly well.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark brown with tiny to large body particles of a thin density and had an average to large, off-white head the mostly lasted. The flavor was nice but a little weaker than I was expecting. There was moderate to heavy malt, light yeast, Dark Fruit Candy sugar, a little spice and some cola. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was moderately sweet and lightly bitter with a short duration. The flavors were dark fruit, candy sugar, a little spice and some cola or vanilla. The medium to full body had fizzy carbonation and a light astringent and light alcoholic finish if it had a finish at all. It sort of just goes down.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

I took a nice healthy swig and held it in my mouth for a bit to feel a creamy softness.  The alcohol is evident from the first sip with a malty raisin taste that you almost want to chew.  As strong as this beer is, you arent overwhelmed by the light undertone of alcohol making this a very drinkable glass of beer.  I understand the raving reviews.

Plums, curarnts, and more fill up the nose.  Has a light effervescence on the tongue with a wash of tingling alcohol highlighted by overripe plums and cherry wood.  As it warms the fruits replace the alcohol notes.  An extremely complex beer that would give you something new every time.

2854,"2008-05-26",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2009 23/5/2008 (9/3/8/2/14) Thanks Lee for bringing this bottle back from Belgium for me! Deep reddish brown with a slight coffee-coloured head.  Slight to moderate carbonation.  Smells deep, rich, vinous.  Texture is silky smooth despite the carbonation.  Tastes initially of plums, port and chocolate; no bitterness at all (even my wife liked this, and she doesnt like beer at all!).  However, the ridiculously over-the-top alcohol soon burns away all other flavours, and for the last two thirds of the bottle this was pretty much all I could taste.  Left a sweet, syrupy mouth coating - sticky to the point of unpleasantness.  The wonderful initial flavours did return some time later, but I have to say that I feel this beer could be improved if the alcohol content could be reduced several notches.  As it is, its still pretty good, but is rather over-rated - are people giving it such high marks purely because of the high alcohol content and the fact that its made by monks I wonder...?  

Re-rate 21/6/2009.  Seems to have improved slightly with age - less sticky and less of an alcohol burn, but with an added and pronounced liquorice flavour.  Maybe Im warming to this beer after all... (9/3/8/3/15)","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

The taste, on the other hand, is big.  Huge mouthfeel and very full and dry body.  Initial sweet flavors of syrupy hops, molasses, and dark fruit give way to a dry finish of brown alcohol, spices, and wood.  Unlike the Bernardus 12, this one doesnt overwhelm the palate with alcohol -- instead its a much more flavorful and dry, almost whisky like on the finish.

Aroma is sweet grapes, black cherries, port wine, raisins, figs and other dark fruits, melded perfectly with Belgian yeast and malts.

Flavor is lots of dark fruits, some alcohol burn, the perfect amount of spices, and vinous notes. The alcohol seems to enhance the flavors rather than detract from them.

Update 12/26/08.  Aroma of dark fruits (apple, pear) and raisins.  Flavor of sweet fruits especially apple.  Quite boozy in the finish.  I do enjoy this beer but I think I rated it especially high because it was the first good beer I really loved.  Always a pleasure though.

I dont get the love.

Opaque tan-brown body (more red than the 8) with large white head. Smells of fruit berries and roasty malts like the 8. The roasts seem deeper. Taste of strong malt with some fruit sweetness, seemingly more balance and a stronger roast aftertaste than the 8.

At first I couldnt really detect much of a scent. After it warmed up a bit I could pull out a roasted scent, somewhat of figs. Even my wife who sat a couple of feet away noted that she could smell rum (alcoholic smell) and raisin. Interesting. These scents only got more intense over time. I tried to avoid pouring the sediment into this one, instead pouring those remains into a shot glass for later. The colour remained very dark and opaque, although in the light small bubbles rising to the surface could be detected. The small head disappeared quickly. The taste is somewhat alcoholic (11+%!), roasted and raisiny. Hard to pinpoint. Clean, but slightly bitter finish. Not thick tasting but could not be described as watery either.

Quite a few floaties. Only about 1/4"" of biege head that recedes to a very thin layer. Quite a bit of solids at bottom of bottle. Aroma reveals some red wine and brown sugar but actually not super deep or rich. Mouthfeel is buttery soft. Sticky finish. Some fine sheets of lacing inside Trappist glass melt away quickly.

As it warmed that dissipated to a complex smell of fruits with a light sourness and smooth chocolate and raisins. Smells incredible. Very deep. Pours a dark brown with a nice sized head that dissipates quickly. For as strong as this beer is the alcohol is well hidden, it comes on a bit in the finish but not overly so.

Definitely a thicker and different taste overall than 8, with a slight bitterness and even, a more oaky initial taste on the tongue. Somewhat musty on the first pour, but generally pleasant and not as shocking as some Belgians, and is in the middle-of-the road flavor-wise for the Trappist beers (I only have the Konigshoven left to try). It does have a kick, but not sharp, but you can tell theres something sneaky going on. basing it on other Quads, this is definitely more pleasant and ""rounder"" in flavor than others, not shifting too much to the extremes of any one taste (I guess ""balanced"" would be another word).

2854,"2008-03-02",3.7,"The Belgian classic.  Years of anticipation led up to this.  A beige rocky head of mountainous proportions sits atop a foreboding, resinous dark body.  There are too many aromas drifting from the glass to even begin to explain, but Ill start from the top with the raisiny, grape jelly scent (no joke) that seems to be the most apparent and noticeable.  This is quickly followed by other dried fruits: plums, dates, figs, and accented with licorice, oak, and a very shy smokiness.  Its all followed with the sweet molasses stickiness of a good dark rum.  At first sip, Im very surprised by how well the11.3% alcohol is hidden in the depths of the beers flavors.  Unlike other big dark beers, this isnt as viscuous as some, and actually has a smooth, well carbonated mouthfeel.  Spices overtakethe palate, a cinammon, clove, and pepper note tingle the back of the tongue, and the red grapes are again noticeable, as well as the roasted smoky character that rises to the roof of the mouth, then slowly floats down the throat, leaving a burnt, spicy, dry,and slightly bitter aftertaste. In a word: breathtaking.  Although pleased with the beer, I was expecting a bit more fruit and chocolate in the flavor.  It think the dry, oaky, smoked mouthfeel created a completely different taste experience than expected, but delightful nonetheless.

2854,"2008-02-27",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2008 Had a mini quad tasting in April 07. Had this one after the Westy12.

Picked this bottle up at Top Shelf Liquor in Allen Park.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy brown color with a 1 finger tan head. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the others.

Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits, nice malts and a slight alcohol burn. There are some winey notes in this too which are very nice. This is followed by dark fruits, figs, roasted malts, and slight cherry. There is some nice yeasty and hop notes in the finish. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms. Cant wait to taste it.

Taste: The tastes are similar to the aroma, but not as noticable. Cherry and dark fruits from the start followed by warming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors. Very nice 

Palate: The dark fruit and malt flavors hang for a bit. This is pretty creamy and goes down too smooth for 11.3%. It should be a crime for something this strong to be this smooth. After a few of these, you will definitely feel buzzed.

Overall. This finished ahead of the rest, slightly above the Westy12, Abt 12 and Chimay Blue. The aroma and flavors were a little stronger in this one. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others). Ive had this with just the Abt 12 before and the Abt was better, but in this case this bottle was better. Youll have to see for you self, you wont be disappointed.","Allen Park, Michigan, USA","northernbrews"

Taste is raisons, plum and even more dark fruits. Very easy to drink (smooth) it has a nice little bitterness in the end. Malty with peaty moss notes. Lots of carbonation and just the right body. Very hard to tell there is even any alcohol in the beer, but still warming. Overall a good beer","Newark, Delaware, USA","GMCC2181"

Dry, clean finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","zeke626"
2854,"2008-02-22",4.5,"Into a tulip this goes with a half inch of tan foam. It is a dark, ruby color. The smell is of dark fruits, and gummy worms, if that makes any sense. There is a maltiness beneath thesweetness. 

The taste is of figs, dark cherries, a leathery dryness percieved at the back of ones tongue, and brown sugar. This needs some time in my cellar, methinks. The mouthfeel is thick, but it is not cloying. Drinkability is high. The taste is so complex, I want to sip, and sip again to discover everythig this brew can offer.

The flavor is very complex as well with dark fruits, malts, candy sugar, plums, cream, and cola all blending together. With each smell and sip new flavors make themselves known. This is deeply complex with just amazing flavors. The alcohol is masked really well. A couple of these and youd be feeling pretty good.

Maybe not as exciting as Orval and not anywhere near the great Gueuzes and Sours, but so Belgian. Like sticking your nose into the mouth of a pit where nothing but naughty but enjoyable things can be had, dark and sweet. Taste stays close to the nose.

2854,"2008-02-13",4.4,"Bottle. Ah, Ive had this a few times in the past but havent gotten around to rating it. I guess I become a little lazy when I know I can get a certain beer quite easily. Anyway, the pour is a dark raw sienna with a lasting light tan head that consists of medium-sized bubbles. The aroma is very pleasing. Dark citrus (such as raisins, dates, and plums) and caramel seem to be pretty dominant. As this brew hits the tongue, your palate is overwhelmed with a burst of flavour. The dark citrus noticed in the aroma is now accompanied by hints of cocoa, a light roastiness, the perfect amount of spices, and some very subtle black tea notes. As the brew passes the tongue, the citrus subdues as the roasty and cocoa notes become more dominant leaving a mildly dry finish. The alcohol flavour adds a little bit of a kick throughout the entire experience and creates a light warming sensation in the chest. The flavours in this beer are so delicate yet defining. Its a beautiful, complex, delicious beer.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

As soon as it was poured the color was dark brown with a redish tinit and a thick foamy head which was off white. The aroma is very strong mainly dates, and other dark fruits with a sour funk.

Nose radiates malt and yeasty fruits with hints of spice. Big bright apple character is grounded with darker fruits and a more subtle breadiness and deeper malt notes. A light pumpkin-like spicy scent is carried on strong whiffs of alcohol. Overall lightly sweet enticing aroma. Even the smell is intoxicating.

Taste is full, but not with intensive depth. Complete, without being too heavy. Bright, slightly bubblegummy sweetness offsets darker fruits of raisin and plum, with nice malt character and a cleanliness about it. Hints of tobacco and richer malt emerge as it warms, adding to a nice depth of flavor. Alcohol definitely makes its presence known with some heat off the back end.

Mouthfeel is lighter/medium in body with a creaminess to it, enhanced by the tight full carbonation. Some alcohol astringency to the feel.

Aroma of cherry, plums, leaves, tea, red wine, maple, maybe even some parmesan cheese?  A bit more subtle than I remember but maybe my nose was more stuffed.  Dry roasty taste, very vinous especially at first, but more flavors appear like tea, the darkest of dark fruits, a slight bit of cherry, and wood.  Finishes woody with a bit of sherry, coffee, chocolate truffle dust, and a mild vanilla flavor.  Warm nutty and spicy with just a bit of warming heat, and a spicy yeast presence throughout the beer.

2854,"2008-01-26",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2009 33 cl bottle. Great beer with a nice flavor of fudge, toffee, chocolate, vanilla... rather sweet. Oily. Well, I liked this one, but is this really better than Chimay Blue for example? I need to try this again, Chimay seemed to get better each time Ive tried it and maybe it will be the same with Rochefort... I think this is better than its ""brother"" Rochefort 8 though.

Update: (Bottle at home on 080327, decided to describe it a bit better, had some notes on the swedish beer site Öltorget). This is an amazing beer, deserves definitely the high score. Aroma is wonderful of sweet candy, raspberry (hallonbåtar?). Its more mellow than I found it the first time. Flavour is very vinous, slightly fiery from the alcohol with liqourice, berries, vanilla, chocolate, fudge and coffee. As the smell, it also got some raspberry candy-like taste too it. Really good, with some warming alcohol in the finish.

Update 2: I had a blind tasting with this and Rochefort 8 with a friend. This one was the tastiest, with nice, fudgey, raspberry-candy aroma and a quite complex, hard to define taste. Its a very good beer but I think Ive overrated both Rochefort beers. Cant really say this is top 10 in the world but its definitely good.

Beautiful, beautiful beer, and definitely one of my all-time favourites.  Absolutely superb.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"

Appearance: Opaque dark brown. Persistent thin lace of head. Not much fizz.

Taste: Like caramel, like brandy, a pleasant wine taste as it is warming.
Mouthfeel: Bubbly in the mouth become creamy.

I am not the biggest fan of any of the Belgians that Ive had so far.  The only two that Ive really liked are the Chimay Blue and the De Dolle Stille Nicht.  This has just surpassed those on my list...

Dark murky pour with a huge tight bubbly head..

Smells very dark and fruity.  Definitely note the plums and raisins.  Very sweet smelling.

Tastes very much like it smells.  Very sweet, lots of fruit with a nice spiciness as well and can also denote the alcohol in there too.

Chocolate cake and redcurrent and raspberry sharp sweetness. Beautifully soft smooth palate - pleasant crisp carbonation, and sweet maltiness. Taste is a wonderful subtle multi-faceted combination - dark roasted grains, dark fruits, sweet dark cake, hints of ginger. Heavenly. (6-5-9-5-17=4.2)
Rerate: Blind tasting against Westvleteren 12, St. Bernardus Abt 12, Rochefort 8 and Chimay Blue.
Deep reddy brown, darker than the others, and with a thick tight beige head. Aroma was strange, had an almost cheesy quality - blue without the salt. Quite savoury, but some perfume too, and an interesting spicy peak. Soft carbonation, silky smooth palate, zing of spice, and a touch of alcohol. The zing from the palate does not dominate, there is quite a rich roast with some burnt edges and some liquorice. Lovely hops in the finish. More exciting flavour than the other 4 - plenty to chew on. Simply delightful.

Pours an opaque nearly black brown with a bubbly beige medium lasting head. Leaves a little bit of spotty lacing. Smells yeasty with raisin, prune, and light berry notes as well as a mild alcohol presence, considering the amount. The flavour is like soft, freshly baked bread, smeared with a perfectly balanced nutty, raisin, prune spread. All this accented by a vinous alcohol note. Soft and lightly carbonated feel with a medium-full body. Nice aftertaste and feel that makes you reach for another sip.

Taste like a heavenly crisp elegant beer. Complex taste of all the aromas mentioned. Smooth and balanced, could hardly notice the alcohol but know it is there. The only downfall to this beer is the size, this beer left me wanting more. Mmmm delicious! Now I can say I have had the best beer I can get my hands on.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","hombrepalo"

First smell I caught when pouring was banana.  Other fruit such as raisin was apparent in the aroma.  Flavor was raisin and plum with alcohol noticeable, but not detrimental.

Anyway, super thick head that tastes of strong, dark fruits.  This one, compared to the 8, had a strong hit on the palate and a drawn out release on the aftertaste that smoothed out gradually.

Beer poured a dark, almost muddy brown color with a slightly creamy head that slowly dissipated and leaves a solid lacing around glass.

2854,"2007-12-23",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2009 Bottle that Jan Primus actually donated to my personal ""Save a starving-student Fund"" for good beer (cant thank you enough!). Pours a deep dark, murky brown. To be honest its not much to look at, in fact I thought it might be infected at first due to the sediment floating around, getting pushed around by the carbonation, that looks like protein chunks, but upon further inspection, is just yeast (which is actually quite tasty IMHO). But oh no, this was not spoiled. Aroma: Not as complex as I was expecting, the typical dark fruits, nice malts, but over-all not a lot going on. But, asit warms, it becomes more sweet and enticing. Taste: Challenging, complex. Prunes, dates, sweet malts, alcohol, almost like red wine. Hints of molasses become more apparent as it warms. The commercial description is bang on in this case, strong plums, raisin, maybe a touch black currant, and its the aftertaste that really makes you realize how deep and multi-layered this beer really is. The alcohol is present, but at 11.3% it actually has a surprising level of drinkability to it. Nice slick mouth-feel. It gets better as it warms; Ive found that higher ABV brews tend to become more cloying and alcoholic tasting as they warm, but this one maintains its peculiar drinkability and sweet flavours. This is definitely a great beer-experience, and I cant wait to try this again in a few years after my other bottle has had some time to mature! I was a bit skeptical at first, as I always am with such high-octane, incredibly high-rated beers, but this one wins you over by the end of it.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

Aroma of dark fruit, prunes and plums, brown sugar notes and light yeastiness. Palate is fantastic with a full creamy mouthfeel and noticable very lively carbonation with only slight alcohol warming. Flavor of brown bread, sugar, some over ripe banana. As this beer changes temperature so does the flavors. I see why people love it for its complexity but at no time does it really break out for me.

Most of the taste is malt and a residual sweetness as you might expect. There are also some spicy phenolic notes and the slight bite of alcohol.

Flavor is also a bit lighter than expected. Very similar to the aroma, but everything seems a bit muted and slightly more alcoholic than the aroma suggests. Palate is medium, lightly bitter, and a little hot. This reminds of Orval, but only becuase it seems quite overrated.

Color is a dark solid brown with light carbonation and nice head.  Taste is rich and sweet.  Starting out with a full body it goes down smooth with a rich feel.  Finish comes on with a sweet malt flavor that has back tones of caramel and a light toasted taste.  On the end it comes off clean feel.

I should however restrain from calling this a Quadruple, as the monastic owners of this brewery would likely frown upon that label. This ale is bold strong and has nothing to hide behind candy sugars. Upon opening the bottle you can smell the aromas bursting from this beer. Pours a deep brown. Deliciously dry, with strong roasted malty flavor, a little yeast, and dry fruit flavors such as raisin and prune. A slight oaky/winey flavor. I get a fantastic alcohol taste from this, reminds me of a tripel in that aspect. A suggestion, drink this ale slowly and let the flavor diminish off your tongue, you will get a fantastic hop taste as the flavor starts to fade.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2854,"2007-11-08",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2010 33cl bottle from Systembolaget.   Rating #100!   Thought that since this is the highest rated beer available here in Lund, it was a good call to cellebrate number 100.   Ok, here we go then.   Very dark brown with a small tan head that leaves lacing til the end.   the aroma itself is intoxicating: sweetness, vanilla, hazelnut, caramel, some butterscotch, and a little alcohol.   The flavor is very sweet and alcoholic; a bit straight-forward in this respect, a lot of caramelized sugar flavor and ripe fruitiness.   The body is very thick and full, but the alcohol keeps it from being too sticky in your tongue, and the coarbonation is ample but very soft at the same time.   This is quite a beer, but I still like Rochefort 8 more, simply because its levels of alcohol and thickness make it a more pleasant experience.   10 is simply a massive beer, youve got to be ready for it for sure or itll kick your ass.

2854,"2007-10-28",4.5,"The Trappist-Rochefort beers are top-fermented brown ales. They are brewed and racked within the walls of the Abbey of St-Remy in Rochefort. The modest size of the brewery means that the Trappist monks and their fellow workers can perfectly control the production process. The craft beer aspect is particularly appreciated by beer lovers. The Trappist-Rochefort 10 starts with a density of 24.50° Plato which produces a 11.3% vol. alcohol. A marvellous beer! But to be drunk in moderation!

Rich layered fruity aroma - cherry, raisin, custard(?), etc. Almost spritzy body. Initial and final impression of alcoholic bitterness. Earth and root tones.

There is heat, plumminess, and most definitely black currant. After the first moments, it seems a bit dusty. The finnish is rather dry, and leaves a dusty, fruity impression.

Mostly plum, raisin on the nose, some great dry/sweet fruit.  Like a great wine, this one changes in the mouth.  Seems to go from dark to lighter fruit as it is aerated.  Loads of complexity I will hopefully re-rate and find.  A finish that lingers forever, I dont seem to notice the alcohol as much as others do.

2854,"2007-10-13",4.7,"Dark, sweet, plum and raisin flavors.  Its one of those lovely Belgian high alochol content ales that manages to taste great despite the alcohol.  It reminds me a lot of Delirium Noel, less so but similar to Nocturnum, only better, but at much higher cost ($6 a bottle in Ohio). Overall, Belgian Ales in general have been my favorite thus far.  This is probably the best dark ale Ive tried thus far.  Its extremely rich and complex.  Duvel is the best amber so far (more smooth versus complex) and thankfully much more affordable than Delirium, but still more than Grimbergen, although definiitely worth it.  At $6  a pop, Trappistes 10 sadly wont be a weekly beer given the amounts of beer I tend to consume these days, but definitely for special occasions.","USA","MagnusVMagnum"
2854,"2007-10-11",4.7,"To me, this is the most beautiful beer in the world (served in the most beautiful glass). The head is unsurpassed, its lacing *tight* yet pearly, containing the brown-red syrup beneath it, like white chain mail armour. The head lacing is really something unique, you can stare at it for hours and it doesnt disappear.Nose is complex, cold caramel in a deep pit of bananas, but no real nose-taste diff aside from the higher alcohol aroma.
The texture of this Trappist is very thick and creamy and makes the dominating flavours (rotten bananas, dough) last long enough to whithstand the high alcohol rate. This is something Bernardus and Westvleteren cant manage well - and it seems like each bottle of Westy rounds off differently.
However, some may feel that the taste is a bit artificial, too fruitish, too freakish, and prefer Westy or other Abts for their more earthily tastes. Im just glad we have all of them.I like to start it off quite cold (10C), and each glass lasts very, very long. I tis absurd to drink more of these a day, but sometimes we are absurd.

More like the aroma of a good, sweet barley wine than that of a typical strong Belgian ale. The aroma remains great even as I sip, refusing to be overpowered by the flavors. The aroma is not quite as strong as I expected, but it is a constant, soothing presence. Still, it is so good that I would love to be overwhelmed by it. A stronger version of the same aroma would have earned a perfect 10 rating.

<P>Pours a very cloudy, opaque, almost gel-like mahogany brown that borders on a shade of purple. There is a burnt orange hue to the liquid. Large amount of relatively large suspended particulate, for I intentionally poured the yeast settlement into the glass. Much of the yeast does settle to the bottom of the glass eventually. Small amount of pinkish/yellowish beige/cream-colored head. Produces some lacing.

<P>Wonderful taste! Like its sibling Rochefort Trappistes 8, Rochefort Trappistes 10 is so complex and unique in taste as to be hard to describe. Sharp spices, especially black pepper, dominate in the initial sips. Raisin flavor, like a port, but also a wheaten bourbon taste. Reminiscent of myriad desserts, including milk chocolate, cream, condensed milk, dark cherries, fruit cake, crystallized sugar candy, malt chocolate, and chocolate chip cookies. Alcohol evident but not overpowering.

<P>Nice, strong, aftertaste of pitted fruit and chocolate baked goods. Medium to full body. Silky smooth in the palate yet very lively on the tongue. There is even a little alcohol burn in the throat, which I enjoy.

<P>11.2 oz. bottle, purchased about a year ago and cellared since. Poured into a Unibroue Maudite tulip glass. Consumed as part of the National Toast to Michael Jackson. Rochefort 10 is an excellent beer, but I do prefer the equally brilliant but less overwhelming Rochefort 8. The beer does improve as it warms, not surprisingly, and I recommend drinking it at close to room temperature. It makes a near-perfect dessert beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Pours an orange-hued, particulate filled, murky walnut colour with a pillowy off-white head that fades to nothing, exposing the effervescent carbonation that never ceases. The aroma is vinous with sweet chocolate covered cherries, molases, raisins, orange slice, yeast, vanilla cask and a bit of smoke. The flavour is reminiscent of cherry cola, with black currants, liquorice, plums, candied sugar and yeasty bread, with a bitter, dry, alcoholic finish. The aftertaste reveals some subtle coffee notes. The mouthfeel is tingly and creamy. Strong bitterness lingers for quite some time and is almost astringent when you lick your lips.

The aroma was the beginning of my disappointment and puzzlement of this beer. My nose received overly sweet notes of bubblegum, flowers, and cotton candy. The alcohol was very overpowering in the taste with a strong astringent bite in the finish along with more bubblegum and wood flavors. The carbonation was surprising due to the lack of head received upon the pour. This was ultra-fizzy and off-balanced along the full body. Again, I was puzzled due to the high acclaim this beer gets. My bottle couldve been old, but Im sure this is supposed to be aged. It could also have been too warm as I did not let it sit in my fridge very long, but I know the colder a beer is, the less flavor your tongue receives.

Some of these opinions are warranted, but there are few that can justify folks calling it, ""the best beer in the world."" Now, I dont believe that any beer can be fall under that title, because beer depends on mood, company, and food, just to name some obvious factors.
That being saidthis is pretty close. Rochefort 10 provides a rich clean taste for such a full bodied Trappist ale; gorgeous dark brown, amber with a subtle, sneaky tasting malty flavor...it seems to just open up in your throat. Unbelievable head on this, very slowly diminishing to a perfect foam layer; plenty of raisin/plum aroma, very striking; one of the smoothest beers I ever tasted.
In a nutshell, this is so far removed from beer as traditionally understood that it needs a different classification altogether. If I ever won the lottery, this would be the beer I toast with.","http://westchesterbeer.com, USA","DeadGuyFrank"

Theres a lot of flavor in here; a dark malt base underscores currant and plum flavors, with yeasty, spicy notes and a finish of bittering hop and warming alcohol.

It has a lively brown head that you could hear popping as it struggled for a life of its own before it settled down into an eighth of an inch of head.

So as much as this beer gets raved over I have to say it was good but not phenominal imho.  So on to the review.

Pours from a bottle a murky dark brown and leaves a few yeast particles floating around with a thick tan head that clings to the glass.  The aroma is dark pitted fruit, rum raisin, candied fruit, brown sugar, spicy, bready aroma.  The taste starts spicy, herbal in nature, a bit sour, dry, fruity, with a warming alcohal finish.

2854,"2007-07-12",4.8,"I tried this beer on July 12, 2007 at The Beer Bistro in Toronto.  Unfortunately I cant rate it as high as the St. Bernardus Abt 12 I had last night.  Maybe had I tried them in the reverse order things may have been different.  Anyway, this poured a dark reddish-brown with a small head (the first contrast with SS).  The head disappeared rather quickly.  The aroma was very similar with robust bread and malt tones as well as plums.  It felt great on the tongue with a full-bodied feel.  As for the taste, Im not sure where it failed when compared to the SB, but it just failed to measure up.  Possibly the higher alcohol content which I noticed more in this brew.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"
2854,"2007-07-11",4.8,"Ridiculously delicious. I honestly find it difficult to identify the flavours because it all seems to work so well together.

Aromas of smooth toffee/cakey malts with dark dried fruits such as cherry, currant, plum, and dark red wine grapes.  Very rich and concentrated dark fruit flavors throughout a heavily earthy malt and yeast foundation, with some prickly vinous and black pepper notes punctuating the finish.  The yeast in the body provides not just a great mouthfeel, but also a satisfying ""stomachfeel,"" as if one were receiving special nourishment.

Wow, Definately the best beer Ive had. Strong walnut, raisin, almost cinnamon flavor. Not too heavily carbinated, goes down really smoothly.

2854,"2007-06-15",3.9,"This is an awesome beer. It is high in carbonation. It almost seems like a soft drink. The flavor is exquisite. This is locally available every day. The Cuvee van de Kaiser and the Westvleteren Abt 12 are not so easy to obtain. They can be a memory for the better part of a year. It is good to know that a quality brew that comes close is out there. A wide range of flavor with a distinct fore, during, and after taste. The odor is not strong.  The palate effect is not diminished by the lack of smell. I was only disappointed in the lack of a lingering aftertaste. It fades far too quickly. Keep spooling and swishing it in your mouth because once you swallow the flavor just wont last long enough. Of course, that is a tribute to the great tastes to be found in this beer. There are so many great Belgian beers. This ones flavor is similar to a number of the very best and just a little bit better than nearly every one of the others.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","rjglory"

2854,"2007-06-09",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2008 Appearance: Pours out dark brown, almost purple-ish. Generous head gave way to a thin layer of bubbles 

Smell: Generous bouquet of sweet caramel malts and candy sugar under a blanket of dark fruit (particularly raisins). Some sweet, juicy nectarines. A dash of spicy yeastiness. A touch of leather. All of it smelling quite ""Belgian"". Note: the high alcohol is surprisingly subdued in the aroma.

Taste: A well blended, outstanding example of a quadruppel. This beer features brown sugar, black cherries, anise, raisins, and toasted toffee malts. Theres a great depth of varying flavors, so pay attention, but dont forget to savor. All of this gives way to a long-lived spicy, white pepper finish.

Mouthfeel: Strikingly smooth, very rich, and with a low, gentle amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: A+++ Power Beer. Would buy from again! As good as folks say, perhaps better. Especially for me, someone whos not overly partial to the style.

Raisin, brown sugar and dark aged rum were also noted. The head is fizzy, off-white with good lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is a murky brown with tiny bits a floatin. Flavor is moderately sweet and lightly acidic to start and ends lightly sweet, moderately bitter and a touch salty in the long finish. The palate would be perfect except for slightly over carbonation and the heavy alcohol feel. Other than that, its medium bodied and somewhere between oily and creamy. This would be a great accompaniment for a stewed game dish.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
2854,"2007-05-21",3.8,"Great beer... #2 in the world, not sure if I agree.  The Roch 10 had a smooth and sweeter flavor than most abbey ales--perhaps to hide the fact that its 11.3% alcohol!

The flavor matches the aroma to a ""T"" (Ive never tried to spell that before), with all those dark fruit flavors that were so apparent in the nose.  Long lasting flavor that is sweet but balanced, light bodied but with a flavor to keep it from being dull.  Alc is warming like a fine beer should.

As for the beer,  I really enjoy the sweetness of it.  Looking at the alcohol content, I expected it to be a little bitter, but it didnt fail to surprise me.  In the glass it has a moderate head (not too thick) and a dark nearly opaque color.  It wasnt too thick and had an exceptional taste, feel, and complexity.

Pours brown with fairly thick Café au lait kind of head that slowly left beautiful laces and circles revealing a beer still alive. Very vinous aroma and among many lovely scents - figs, dates, tobacco, cake, overripe plums, caramel and chocolate were most dominant. But what stroke me most was that lovely spice Ive never been able to fully pinpoint. I could smell this for hours! The flavor is rich and though 11,3% its never near boozy. Extremely well balanced with a high complexity. Sweet but no overly so. The esters gives it plenty of dark overripe fruit like plums, dates and figs and the roasted malt together with the brown sugar left me with thoughts of nuts, caramel and chocolate cake. Im happy to report: Though its been more than 10.000 beers since I last did this one properly. Its still one of the all time greats. Its a masterpiece. It warmed up my cheeks and put a big smile on my face. What a great beer. Boy I have missed it without being aware of it!!!

Poors darker than the other 2, i would say a dark chocalate color with a hint of raisin purple. Tastes enjoyablly intense. Not over intense, but more intense than the other Trappistes. After the initial shock of taste/flavor/aroma, it goes down easy after a few tastes and sipes. Has the almost feel of a wine, with hints of it tasting that way also. Tastes like they put a lot into this one, very rich.  Obviously a site favorite for the combination of ABV strength, but ability to hide the alcohol.

It poured a ruby red-brownish color, with some pronounced carbonation (at first) and a thick, off-white/tannish head. The lacing went straight down the glass, slowly, but a little more clear than expected -- most likely due to the alcohol. The aroma, as per my notes, was fruity with specific emphasis on rum, dates, raisins, prunes and some molasses.

I cannot help but zero in on the sweet notes that range anywhere from apricot to sugared ricotta (it is possible that my imagination is getting away, but Id swear by it).  In the same breath though one cannot escape the more grounded flavors: faint cheese, meadow, and perhaps hundreds of others.

2854,"2007-04-05",3.7,"11.2oz bottle (2005 I believe). I think this is the first time Ive had this beer, and honestly I find it to be a bit overhyped. Its certainly well above average and a strong entry as a traditional Belgian quad. Very rich but with alcohol fairly hidden, huge nose of plums and oak with some caramel notes. But its a bit less balanced than Id hoped for, somewhat fizzy and with a mouthfeel thats far too thin for my taste. Comes on strong but finishes too weak. Obviously still quite fine, but Im not sure (based on this initial sample, at least) that it deserves the stellar ratings.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2854,"2007-04-05",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2008 Right up there with other great quadrupels, like St Bernardus Abt 12. Dark mohogany color and strong aroma of raisins and figs, with a dark vanilla head and sticky lacing that lasts forever. I love the taste on this one, dark fruits, yeast, raspberry, banana, lots of raisin and faint sweet oak flavors. This beer is quite similar to the Bernardus 12, but in a side by side tasting, it is much sweeter, with bigger berry notes to it. Nice palate as well, awesome body and the finish leaves a tingly film on the tongue. Great beer, but I believe it still falls short of Westvleteren 12.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

Hot fudge sauce-colored beer with a small-to-medium, creamy tan head that lasts better than any. Aroma is luscious spicy fruit with chocolate caramel, and all that is good on planet earth. Taste is the same fruity chocolate goodness, plus nice hop tingle and counterbalance. These Rocheforts are an experience unto themselves, and I dont think they go well with food (except maybe dessert), but who needs anything else when you have one of these!

2854,"2007-04-02",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2008 Pour was a super dark brown with hints of ruby and copper struggling to stream through.  Head was nearly two fingers tall and off-white.  More active carbonation than I expected.  Next time I drink one of these Im going to let it really open up for a while before diving in.  The aroma I got initially was a chocolate covered cranberry.  As it opened up the chocolate maintained but the tart berry settled into a softer raisin like aroma.  The flavor was chocolate, cedar and mild floral.  The palate was heavy on carbonation and not as velvety as I had hoped.  As it opened up the finish became ridiculously succinct.  Almost chianti-like in its dryness.  I think I got a really young bottle of this stuff.

The nose was incredible, very fruity and nutty their was also a real waft from the alcohol in this powerful and strong beer. The taste was really something amazingly complex but I sat there and at one point it was though I had dipped my hand into a really expensive box of dark chocolate liquor chocolates and had just let it melt on my tongue, and waited as the dark cocoa taste of the chocolate receded as the alcohol and liquor were released, fantastic. Dark fruits and a wonderful creaminess also present themselves, this is a beer Ive had many times before but never rated, sit down, take your time and have it melt on your tongue superb!","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

Taste of sweet malt with notes of dark fruit, especially prune. Little carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for such a high ABV. Nice beer, but I still think it lags behind the St. Bernadus 12.

2854,"2007-03-30",4.1,"The aroma of this beer is ridiculous! I am very pleased with the smell. Smells frutier than the 8 version. Very pleased to say that I am already impressed. The color is a very deep brown, with little head, but seems very good. The alcohol sits very nice on the tongue, and the beer finishes  smoothly. The beer is sweet, and fruity, as to what specifically the fruits are I am confused, but it doesnt matter. This beer is very complete. I am going to say that the fruit is a dark fruit: raisins, pruins, something that would make a thick juice. A nice beer, and probably one of my favorites. I hate to rate this higher than my Imperial Stouts, but until I try one better I will not say differently.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Anyways, on to the beer!  Dark brown, opaque, loads of ""floaties"" massive foamy light brown/tan head. Active carbonation, the bubbles form a honeycomb structure under the foamy head, interesting looking! Sweet malts, toffee, prunes, honey a hint of allspice in the nose. Smooth & creamy, sweet toffee & raisins, like a new flavor of ice cream topped with spiced rum, cotton candy, traces of hazelnut....theres so many flavors at once plus the alcohol sneaks in after the swallow to make its presence known. Thick & chewy, a delicious dessert beer and another fine example of why Belgian Quads are one of (if not my absolute) favorite style.

2854,"2007-03-22",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2010 I cant believe I havent rated this one yet.  The first time I had this it was utterly glorious.  Layers of fruit and spices exploded, one by one, and it just seemed to emit a magical quality.  The aroma is the best Ive ever known in a beer.  Aside from the usual adjectives, I find it especially full of blueberries.  Im only giving it a 16 overall because it is hit or miss; some bottles seem more like coca-cola than a trappist quad.  I originally got a bunch of bottles from 2004, and Im letting the rest age as long as I can hold out.  I feel that this beer definitely takes on a different character with age.

9/16/2008 - 2004 bottle.  This beer has changed significantly during the past two or so years.  Small, creamy wisps float atop the brew.  Any hint of bitterness has vanished.  Mouthfeel is creamy and luxurious, amazing.  There is some magical quality in the aroma I could never put my finger on, I feel like its reminiscent of blueberries.  The beer is much more well-rounded today with 3+ years of age.  Theres a really creamy richness, like chestnuts and honey.  Tends toward tropical rum at times.  The finish is much shorter, the beer is more round.  A very rich sweetness shines in the middle.  Difficult to describe but a joy to drink this bottle.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

2854,"2007-03-19",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2016 33cl bottle at home (20 IX 2014). An aroma which makes me think of caramel, and above all of coffee, nuts and toast. The hops arent pronounced; the yeast tastes like leather. Besides that this classic brew has hints of vanilla and liquorice. The appearance is rather brown than red, with a hazy smoothness and yellow brown foam. The taste is obviously heavy sweet, with a touch of mild bitterness. The palate: a heavy body, thin-smooth texture which feels oily, sticky and yet creamy too. An average carbonation, a sharp ending. This is a lovely beer, at blind tastings hinting clearly at trappist/quadrupel.Previous rating (19 III 2007): Excellent trappist beer. This beer can compete with the best beers of the world.

The nose is of roasted malt, aniseed, herbs, pineapple and toffee accompanied by a huge amount of licorice and almonds. An extremely pleasant, complex and unique aroma. A lot more alcohol showing up in the Rochefort 10 than in the Rochefort 8. Wonderful taste with figs, roasted malt, aniseed (not noticeable in the rochefort 8), nougat (which adds a lot to this beer), herbs (I cant make out which ones, but definitely an excellent blend), pineapple and homemade caramel showing up. A beauty. Deeply pleasant silky mouthfeel. Full bodied. Beautiful lacework. Definetely a lot of alcohol in this beer - which is a little too present for my liking. Especially just before the finish.

Appearance is of dark carmel with a full head that lingers a lacey goodness throughout the glass.  Dont know if the look gets any better. Smells of slightly sweet malty with an almost herbal overtones.  
Has a nice mouthfeel of balance between creamy and carbonation.  Taste is very easy and comforting with an alcohol hit thats almost medicinal, but more comforting than disturbing.  Malt and carmel bring a second flavor and then leaves the alcohol to linger yet not overpower.

2854,"2007-02-07",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2008  Ive had this beer over two dozen times probably since first trying it.  This is a regular beer for me and my go-to beer when Im in the mood for a dark Belgian.  Ive had several blind tastings with this versus St Bernardus 12 and this is the clear winner I think.  My first rating for this was a little simplistic so I wanted to do this beer justice by rating it again.

Pours very dark brown with a large and excellently retained off-white head.  Lacing and carbonation are intense.  Aroma is piney, sweet, plums, vanilla, lavender with some chocolate and raisins in there for good measure.  Strawberry jam, figs.  Just a great and unique aroma, super complex.  Taste is similar to the aroma, matching its complexities and containing the same adjectives for the flavor.  This is amazing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

2854,"2007-02-06",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2007 Rating 100, bottle from the Evil Eye in York.  Pours an immense, rocky, and classically Rochefort tan-tinged head with huge bubbles.  The edges fade before the middle, leaving a plateau of foam on top of a dark brown beer with ruby highlights.  Slight sediment despite leaving the last few ounces in the bottle.  Aroma is mild at first but picks up as this warms:  clove, cinnamon, a slight earthy must, dark stone fruits and candy.  More than slightly tinged with alcohol, making my nose tickle.  I needed to fend off the head to get to the nectar below.  Once I finally did, I was hit with loads of spice - clove, nutmeg, black pepper - all of which have a lasting stay on the tongue.  Plums and raisins predominate but this is not overly sweet as the spice balances it well.  Slight pine, finish is caramel and slightly burnt notes with a mild bitterness.  Slightly warming with an unfortunately boozy, moderate alcohol presence that was detectable and approached taking away from the enjoyment.  Quite similar to 8 with the slight alcohol presence that is unfelt in the younger brother.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"
2854,"2007-02-05",4.3,"Milk chocolate brown in color with thick diminishing head. Head is an awesome marbled tan with dark brown veins. A lot of floaties and little lacing.

Some alcohol notes, especially that pinch in the back of the throat and some tongue numbing. Oily, thick mouthfeel. All around really great.

Somehow Ive never got around to rating this, but we just popped one, so here goes: The beauty pours a dark to almost black brown with a very retentive and perfect tanned head sitting up top.  The aroma on this is simply incredible.  Cherries, plums, banana, and hints of rainsins are all present, while also bringing a huge sweet malt characteristic back by a tiny hint of milk and dark chocolates.  This is one of those beers that echoes almost completely its nose.  Flavors starting in a sweet chocolately malt department move into a very complex fruity taste with plums, figs, cherries, and apples being very present.  Absolutely incredible mouthfeel, very smooth and velvety, medium carbonation.

Appearance is a deep dark almost black shad of red with a huge off-white head.  Flavor is great, but I had one about a year ago, and it was layers upon layers of complex flavor.  Ever second, a new taste would push itself to the forefront and overwhelm your taste buds for a second, then another delectable taste would push its way through.  This bottle is different.  Its more straight forward and not that complex menagerie of flavors, but it still is a wonderful tasting beer.  I was looking for the beer that I tasted so long ago, so I guess it disappointed me a little.  Great Quad.

This brew is just perfectly balanced, with its hefty 11.3% ABV remarkably well-hidden. Murky, dark-brown pour with generous head and moderate lacing.  Complex aroma and flavor of dark fruit, spiced rum, vague chocolate and too many other elements to identify.  Creamy mouthfeel and peppery finish.

2854,"2007-01-14",4.5,"August 05. I had looked very much forward to tasting this highly praised beer. I wanted to share with someone that would cherish it. So it was Viktor, our friend, who helped us with our - no MY - beer cellar http://www.metzger.nu/discus/messages/34891/34891. Its a 8 month old and very lively bottle, but the precious drops are captured in our glasses. The aroma spreads in the room, and we look silently at our glasses in awe. We sip the first moutfull - and we are both completely quiet. The first thought that comes to mind are some words from an old song by Kay Norman Andersen / Børge Müller, that goes like this: ""I never felt heaven as close as now..."". Words like sterling suddenly seems small. Both aroma and flavour are like a basket full of ripe, dark fruits. The flavour has myriads of notes and shades, and its difficult to keep track of them. But I do get a lot of notes of dark fruits, port wine, caramel and a hint of licorice. Its the most fantastic beer I have tasted until this day, and Im glad that I have more of this fantastic beer in my cellar - where I also keep some Westvleteren, yet to be tasted. Its a beer that is very full-bodied, we enjoyed this one for an entire hour...
After this, the very first time, I have tasted it several times. I still like it a lot, but if I were to critize anything, then its somewhat sweet. So depending on my mood (sometimes a sweeter beer is nice), I most of the time like the Westvletern 12 better.","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"

It truely is a complete beer in all senses with the best palate of any beer I have ever tasted. Ive been lucky to try several bottles (one in particular that was five years old and would have warranted a perfect 5). The difference between that landmark beer moment and this particular bottle is that in my experience fresh Rochefort 10 has a more aggressive phenol quality to it that softens with age. The juicy figs and raisin notes also thicken with time, lending a heavier, more aggrandized character to this exeptional beer.

A surprisingly lively, yeasty character, with a lingering marmite bitterness in the finish. Really sticks around. Marmite liqueur punching below its proclaimed 11.3%. Intensely yeasty as you drain the tulip. Impressively bitter and twigletly for such a big-hitter, and more than capable of standing up to the festive cheeseboard.

Ive had this beer a number of times over the past couple of years, but Ive never felt competent to rate it before. Now, my palate seems to be at the place that I can really appreciate what this beer has to offer. It pours a dark, dark brown with a full and long-lived tan head; the aroma is dark brown-sugar caramel with vinous notes and some dried frut. The flavor is a marvel. Toffee and dried fruit on the beginning, but never too sweet; tobacco and light yeasty tones, a midrange through finish that becomes amply bitter but never overblown. The palate is superb, perfected carbonated and not the least bit sticky, just full. There is a bit of alcohol flavor and a little bit of heat here, but surprisingly little considering the 11.3% that it is carrying. 8/5/9/5/17=4.4

This is unquestionably a benchmark beer. Few others are going to match up.

2013 rating Bottle from Whole Foods Roosevelt, immediately following a bottle of Rochefort 8. Pours into my Koningshoeven goblet in a rich brown with a slightly smaller head than the 8. This is a boozy big brother to the Rocheford 8. Tasting this, I better appreciate the dry finish and hidden alcohol of the Rochefort 8. Massive dried plummy aroma with brown sugar and plenty of booze. The contrast with the 8 is really striking. Here the flavor is not subtle in the least. Sugar and spiced cake, all that dark fruit, This is not as balanced or well integrated as Westy 12 or St. Bernardus. Its good, but not as good as I thought it was the first time around. Today Id go about 8/4/8/4/17=4.1. In other words, darn good and a 99-100 percentile beer, but not the best quad available regularly let alone the best quad on the planet.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Silk and oak impressions in the mouth imitate the softest scotch.  Clearly theres no reason to try to ciphon every last flavor out of this brew or to labor to write them down.

The mouthfeel is beautiful, very heavy and silky. Superbly complex, so smooth and rich, and you cant taste the alcohol at all, which, at 11.3% should be considered a feat of magic. Maybe it is.

A distinct sweetness was evident - notes of chocolate, raisins and candied fruit - cherries?  Vinousness notes in the aroma come through during the first sips. The upfront sweetness and notes of candied fruit quickly move to a moderate bitter/alcohol finish.  Id like the finish to be more smooth and it may soften with age.  This beer is complex and drinkable.  Pull a chair up to the fire and enjoy.","Maryland, USA","swami"

2854,"2006-09-30",4.4,"Bottled at Volo (Yay Ralph!!) It seemed a litle cold to me so I snuck  quick taste and then let it warm up some... It poured a gorgeous warm amber colour with a thick rich tan head. Lovely carbonation bubblihg throughout. Balanced fruity and malty undertones in the scent. The first taste was a little disappointing ut once I let it warm up a little the fruit and malt flavours mingled to tempt my palate. The fresh carbonation tickled my mouth creating a nice contrast between the generally smooth texture of the beer. A lovely mouth feel. Considering it is 11.3% ABV there is remarkably almost no alcohol bight. There is a faint hint but it is dificult to figure out if that is from the alcohol or just a little over stimulation of the taste buds. In my opinion this should be far higher up the top 50 beer list than it is.... I havent had any Westy yet but they are going to have to do one hell of a job to one up Rochefort.

Roasted caramel and other malt characteristics can also be noted in the tasting impression. Flavor is full sweet with some light bitterness. Finish is long and complex again. Sweet/roasted and fruity. I just dont understand that this beer is not up amongs the top 5 beers in the world top 50 list.

2854,"2006-09-15",4.3,"This beer pours a light cola brown that was very murky with a few clumps of yeast swimming around the bottom. It also had a tan and copper head that is creamy smooth with only a few large bubbles sticking together in clumps. As the beer sat, the head got creamier and smoother. The head stuck around until the end with a film of mini bubbles that looked like a sheet of tiny ball bearings. When I finished the last of the beer, there was still a spot of head in the bottom of the glass. Nice. 

The beer smelled of maple syrup, molasses and black liquorish. There was also a yeasty smell of pepper and spearmint. I found it amazing was that there was zero alcohol smell, even at 11.3%. 

The flavor was magnificent. It tasted of smooth and creamy brown sugar and marshmallows with a dry coffee and liquorish finish that stuck to the roof of my mouth. There was also a pleasant warming in the finish. The flavor possessed a certain quality that I can only liken to jazz. It wasnt how many notes that were played, but the quality of the notes. Fantastic! Also, there wasnt a hint of booze in the flavor beside the warming, but my stomach warmed up none the less. Very nice.

Body is dark brown on the walnut side--yellows, not reds--and completely opaque due to the cloudiness of the liquid.  Aroma is dark fruits: prune and plumb with a measure of roastiness.  It has a molasses aroma that reminds me of Samuel Smiths oatmeal stout.  Fruity esters rise up with a hint of sweet alcohol.  Belgian yeast permeates the nose with a warm bready smell in with all of the fruitiness and dark malts.  Rich and delicious aroma.  The body is full with a nice dose of crisp, dry carbonation on the silky side with a dry finish.  The taste is delectable with dark fruity malts up front, including prune, plum, grape and something lighter like pear or apple.  There is a certain breadiness that might be found in a pastry or home-baked fruit-containing creation combined with a crisp earthiness that tastes old--like a cellar--yet fresh and clean.  A sweet and sour, alcoholic and fruity finish leave behind an apple peel, sugar, pear and warmth.

Thick mouthfeel with sharper than expcected carbonation.  Taste has lots of dark malt, dark sugar and generous earthiness.  As it warms further dark fruits getting even more dominant as well as a spice aspect and some anise.  Finish has sharp carbonation then spiciness from the hops mixing with the thick malt.

Average sized off-white creamy head which lasted about half way down the glass.  In spite of the huge bulk of sediment, this beer was only slightly cloudy.  Lots of suspended tiny particles.  Aroma is moderately yeasty, predominantly sweet of candied pears, brown sugar, ripe brie (with some ammonia), earth, light alcohol, and a nice touch of aged scotch whiskey.  Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acetic, with notes of maple candy and caramel.  Medium bodied, smooth, but somewhat watery, lively carbonation, vinegary finish.

Flavors are pretty huge- moderate carbonation, plenty of dark fruits like cherries, plums,  raisins initially; then a nice woodiness comes through.

The flavors were completely overwhelming:  sweet malt, dark roasted grains, dried fruits (cherries, plums, raisins, blueberries) as well as fresh apple and pear notes.  The alcohol is definitely present in the flavors, especially in the finish, but the beer as a whole is so sweet and complex that this doesnt take away from the experience.

Ive had this one many times over the years.  It doesnt hold the sway it once did with me.  That aroma s still amazing, but it can be a little boozy at times.

2854,"2006-07-30",4.9,"What else can I say about this beer that hasnt been said already? I have had the pleasure of trying this beer on two different occasions and it was excellent. The aroma is yeasty, doughy, a little eartiness to it. The flavors are dark fruits, sugars, and just the smallest bit of alcohol. I could hardly even taste the alcohol in it (ecspecially at 10%). My only downfall with this beer, while I dont even think it is a downfall...is that it is almost too balanced (if there is such a thing). I like a little more aggressive taste to my beers. Its almost hard to pick out the different levelsd of this beer because it is so complex and wonderfully balanced in every aspect.","Zemst, BELGIUM","Theaxe"

Good carbonation and a creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.

Alluring wafting scent of sweet malt, alcohol, yeast, candis, chocolate, wood, dried fruit, and a little bit of musk.  Yeah, pretty amazing nose.  Taste takes most of those elements, but the alcohol is too sharp here, too warming, too crisp, too aggressive.  Bit of a burn, and the creamy thickness of feel is damaged, and the finish covers over the hops.  Aftertaste is more of a dry raisin.  A big beer, and a marvelously complex one, but Im going to go with the 8 next time. [2006.06.28: 4.1]Re-rate, bottle best before end 26.03.2019, so quite fresh.  Nose robust and sweet, deeply malty with fig, date, a little rum-raisin; touch candyish, ripe fruit, tiny bit of chocolate but thats minor.  Just loads and loads of yeast character.  Pours deep, dark garnet that almost blots out the sun, supports a large foamy beige head that reduces apace.  Medium body very attenuated and finishes much much drier than it starts, silky-smooth alcohol gently warms and seems classy and elegant and quiet; bitterness there but faint, body a touch airy, touch of orange peel, esters strong but the banana quickly yields to the bigger fig.  Getting up into spirits territory here, and though this guy can handle it, and everything was controlled, the extra gin-like alcohol isnt really doing much for me [the beer on the whole reminds me very much of some recent oude genever, just less barrel character].

If I had to choose one word for this beer it would be ouch. The brew starts out relatively smooth with a nice bitter taste, but then starts to take on the characteristics of rubbing alcohol. I have to be honest I read some of the reviews before actually making my review, and I noticed how some where saying that the alcohol wasnt noticeable. Let me make this clear, the alcohol was very noticeable. It tasted and felt like I had dropped a shot into the beer before drinking. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed it, but damn caught me way off guard. In my personal opinion Im not sure if this beer really deserves as high of ratings, but what do I know? Maybe it was just a little too strong for me.. but then again Im the one who picked it out.

2854,"2006-06-02",4.9,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2007 Outstanding. Poured a nice dark brown color with hues of red in the light. Head was about a finger thick and pillowy and lasted throughout the drink with sound lacing. Sediment was fun to watch settle at the bottom. Aroma was sweet and spicy with some dark fruit and yeast scents. Mouthfeel was smooth, slightly creamy, with solid carbonation. The flavor was outstanding: started out spicy and finished sweet with plum or some other dark fruit (plums). Alcohol didnt hide as well on my second tasting of this beer, although the first time it didnt seem overpowering and the 3/07 tasting of a fresh bottle was smooth as anything. This beer is rated highly for a reason, a little fruitier and sweeter than Westy 12. (Sampled a June 04 batch both of the first two times, and a Nov 06 bottle the third time.). Re-rate, 2/07, 2yr old cellared version (June 04), and this thing was ever so smooth, the alcohol settled down so well, the dark fruits were very nicely supported, waiting underneat the entire beer experience, those plums really catching mem, yet not sweet. The main knock on Roche 10 when fresh can be the alcohol, but this aged version was fantastic. Somewhere in between fresh and 2yrs is probably the optimum, though (slight oxidation, cardboard underneath???). 7/07 re-rate of a few month old bottle (24.01.11) in a horizontal between St. Bs 12 and Westv. 12, this one the clear and firm winner, my favorite quadruple, surpassing the others in a few verticals to-date, only one bad experience with alcohol heat, never repeated. The pour was beautiful, the aroma was floral, plums, dark fruits, overall fruits, spices. The flavor followed suit, so rich and full, finishing with a little spice zing, bready yeast finish, touch of metallic notes (but in a good way and probably only described as such for lack of a better descriptor). Really, a wonderful quad, sweetens with warmer temperatures, yet the alcohol was sublte still, the sweetness not over the top, rich, balanced with some spicey zing, and light yeast bitterness. Wonderful stuff.","","User37895"

2854,"2006-05-27",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2006 Appears a hazy dark caramel brown with a small light tan head that fades into a mild, dissipating cap and collar.  Little bits of yeast are in the bottom of the glass with tiny bubbles slowly rising to the top of the beer.
Smell is of dusty caramel, brown sugar, raisins, molasses, cocoa,bananas, with dark fruits, and berries.
Taste is of the same aromas in a fine, fine mix that is like an outstanding milk shake with well blended sweetness and rum.
Mouthfeel is rum filled with a banana & cocoa shake mixed with a dash of caramel, raisins, and brown sugar that is evenly balanced with a touch of alcohol....reminds me of a drink I got on my honeymoon that was a banana mashed in a blender with rum and cocoa syrup.  These beautiful flavors coat the tongue and palate with a pleasing dessert like enjoyablilty that makes you forget that there is over 11% abv.

2854,"2006-05-26",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2009 12-oz. Pours deep muddy brown with a moderately geysery tan head. Plenty of fruit (plum, sweet red wine grape) and yeast and sugar in the nose, in that order. The mouthfeel is definitely a triumph; velvet and tiny bubbles at the same time. The flavor brings plenty more of the same fruit, some nut and date, and a sour twist at the finish. This beer finishes on the front of the tongue rather than the back, which makes me think I may be losing my faculties just at the moment. This is a great beer, and no doubt cellaring would bring out a lot more from it.

2854,"2006-05-25",4.0,"Pours muddy brown with a thick, white/tan head that last.  Aroma is dark fruits, plums, raisons, some malt, and alcohol--was fairly strong and pleasing at first, but dissapated quickly.  Strong and malty sweetness upfront.  Significant spicey notes that balance the malt.  Dark fruit.  Alcohol is big provides a lasting warmth.  Overall, its a fantastic beer, with a great amount of complexity, but I think there was more going on in the aroma than the flavor...a bit disappointed.","OFallon, Missouri, USA","jimvy"
2854,"2006-05-22",4.8,"A nicely laced head which dissipates with with a delightful effervescence in the tawny pour.  The aroma is quite Belgian (go figure) - yeastiness, aged ripened fruit, spiciness, sweet malt, honeysuckle, and hints of the alcohol.  Very inviting.    A velvet caress of the tongue in a smooth beer for the strength, the flavors include a mild but surprising blast of yeasty, fruity goodness up the nasal cavity whilst providing a nearly perfect melding of sweet ripened plummy malts, pears, smokiness, toasted nuts, and aged noble hoppiness on the tongue.  This stuff is very, very good.  Surprisingly, no alcohol hotness in this 11.3%ABV beer.  Reminiscent of a perfectly cooked aged beefy filet mignon for some reason.  I would love to have a case of this in the cellar for special occasions.  Remember to pour the whole bottle, the yeast at the bottom adds a great deal of additional interest and complexity to this one, which is best at around 60-65 degrees F.","Centennial, Colorado, USA","segfault"

2854,"2006-05-19",3.9,"This seems to be all the rage around here. It is good, so I understand why I guess. It is weird when a Belgian just takes an area by storm, as it has the San Diego area in the past six months at the least. Trendy is a bad word to throw around, but in this case, in the diehard San Diego beer drinking community, it applies most appropriately. If you find your way to the RB guide to the best beer in CA, this one ranks in at #2. Pretty high for a beer that is not even brewed in this country, let alone in CA. But the high rating is not undeserved, as far as these whole arbitrary lists go. This is an excellent beer, best poured into that flat-bottomed trappist-style glass which exposes a wide surface to the air. Mellow, maybe a little fruity with the raisins flavor, but all the same agreeable for the most hesitant palate. If anything, the malty sweetness comes through a little stronger than would be hoped, but there is a spicy bitterness (vague hops and sour cherries) in the end that saves it. Complex, intriguing, and unexpected. Not necessarily worth the hype, as far as this SoCal drinker is concerned. But it still deserves a good score.","San Diego, California, USA","bindpmc"

A flavor that is just as complex, it is a sweet and a tad yeasty. It just had a bit of foamy body that kept me from rating it higher.

warm coffee-brown colour,if holding it tho light,red glimpses(before pouring some sediment in it)After,it grows darker,but there remains a warm gloom.

just by opening bottle,much of a sort of banana smell,but moresweet(more like this brown,chewy dried bananas i once bought in a organic-food shop) by pouring it into the glass it smells more like sweet pears,and like dates and figues.8and smells a little bit wine-like)

rather carbonated in mouth.an interesting bitter-sweet taste is there,but always some fruits(pears,figues)some caramel-notes
a little bit remembering  a good,old  port,but more refreshing.alcohol is there but fits with the tasts.

Aftertaste bitter-sweet,but fruity too,with warm alcohol(here too,alcohol fits with the tasts),at the end,some caramel or even something chestnutlike.

thats one of the best examples how a strong beer beer should bee,with a great complexity of aromes and tasts to discover,not only strong because of alcoholic-content!!

Big light brown head that collapses to nothing rather quickly. The aromas are a little crazy: sweet and rich caramelized banana, butter toffee, nutmeg, raisins, and maybe a hint of bubblegum. Heavy mouthfeel, creamy, sweet toffee, banana, brown sugar, earthy yeast and more sweet spices. Very bold warm alcohol that is present but well integrated, adding depth rather than harshness.

Dark fruits, anise, clove and a malty nuttiness.  Flavors are bountiful but not as rich as the aroma lends itself to.  Caramel and molasses join in with fruit and nut flavors.

Finally the head settles to smell the nose which is excellent; notes of plum, prune, raisin, brown sugar, pound cake, spicy wisps of alcohol, some leafy/perfumey hops, and cherry.  Flavor is powerful with chocolate and raisin; other complexities include cherries, plum, a coffee tinge to add bitterness, and even anise and black currant (as the description suggests); a little port-like.  Palate is soft to lively and round with a full body, and chewy.  Finish is long and sweet with a slight warming and notes of cake, chocolate, currant, and coffee.

As it warms up, its pungent with dark stewed fruit (plum, currant, raisin, apricot), spices (clove, cadamom...), dank basement, and something perfumy I cant put my finger on.  So far, the best smelling beer Ive ever had.  Sharp carbonation and heavy roundness on the palate.  Dark malts are the first taste, mocha, stewed raisin pear & plum, and a bit of rootbeer.

Flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, grapes, currants, candied pecans and more.  Very sweet, but also tart and sour.  Nicely vinious.  Way more carbonation than I expect from a beer like this, but it is an extremely soft and forgiving carbonation.

The tan-colored head is like a rootbeer float, and lasts about as long!  I kept waiting for it to go down so I could actually taste the brew!  The aroma is sweet, syrupy, with mostly yeast and ripe bananas.  The taste is similar though a bit darker, raisiny, maybe a bit like a strong cough syrup alcohol-wise.  The brew is fizzy throughout, and it finishes sweet, a bit like port wine with only a hint of bitterness and a warming alcohol bite.  The mouthfeel is medium, nice and only slightly sticky.  Its good, one of my favorites, and I will definitely look for it again next time Im buying beer!

This is a fantastic beer and if one can wrap their brain (and tongue) around the complexities of this beer then you are surely that much further on your way to a better place. The aroma was multitudes of dark fruit and chocolate and toffee and brown sugar. The appearance was beautiful to look at as it was incredibly dark (stout like?) with little light passing thru but what did was a deep purlple, almost eggplant like purple to it. The taste is almost liquer like, with a sweetness to match the dark fruity-spicyness that is velvety soft on the tongue.

Dark stone fruits, vanilla, caramel, whisky, cloves, oak and hot cross buns all on the nose.  A faint whiff of green apple peel lends an acidic edge.

Sweet aroma contains hints of toffee, pears, bananas, raisins, caramel and chocolate.  It poured with a thick, heavy foamy head that was chocolately brown.  The flavors are so dense and complex that even at the end of the bottle I was picking up on new things.  There were first a taste of dark bakers chocolate and a slight bitterness.  This was followed by caramel and pears/cherries.  After that, a slight carbonation.  Then toffee and more caramel.  It just sits on the tongue and unfolds more pleasures.  The finish was a little strong, which is why it doesnt get a full 5.0.  The alcohol warms the throat but does not overwhelm the senses.

Its quite sweet but rich with an array of spiced dry fruits and various vinous notes. The aroma is very assertive and complex. The flavor is no let down. It is less sweet in the mouth, savory with a dry plum finish, and highlighted with nutmeg, earth,  slight banana, a bit of wood. . .just a plethora of robust spices. The alcohol blends perfectly in the mix and makes it less apparent. The nose is fairly different than the flavor and the two combine quite well with each sip.  The head lasts throughout the entire drink and intense lacing marks the chalice. I feel sad and alone when I reach the end.

Bottle split with Tronraner and Muenster in a  blind tasting among Allagash Four, Rochefort 10, and St. Bernardus 12. It was a pleasure to pit this against some worthy beers in a blind to better evaluate the hype. I thought this one was the winner after the taste. It had unmatched richness and excellent, pronounced qualities all around. The pour was beautiful: near black with noticeable carbonation and a well defined head that survived the entire tasting session. The aroma is very bold with spicier, pointed notes of cloves, chocolate covered bananas, earth, bread, figs. This is has most powerful and longest lasting flavor of any example Ive encountered in the style, yet it maintains delicate balance and intricate complexity.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Nice thick and creamy tan head that sticks around. Initial aroma is malty...caramel, light English toffee...canned strawberries...saccharine...grapes...apple and orange blossoms...fruit cake. Amaretto? Apparently. First taste really hits the left and right sides of the tongue at the back of the throat with...hmm...sour apples. Super malty. Like a box of naked whoppers. The alcohol is really prevalent here. Berries...raspberries, strawberries. More like unripe strawberries. Carnation...there is something else floral in here that I cant quite place, but its not rose. Guess I need to eat more flowers. Finishes with smoky oak, sugared raisins, old coffee, dates, and lots of alcohol. Oh, and a touch of caramel. Well, it happens to be warming my chest now, and I feel full even though I havent eaten in 4 hours. Texture is really nice, like milk, and the head adds a little bit of creaminess. So Im a bit torn. It is very complex, with aromas, flavors, and aftertastes that are so different from one another (and diverse in their own right) that my my mouth got all confused. Most certainly a well crafted beer. That being said, I just plain didnt enjoy it as much as other Trappist ales Ive had the pleasure of sampling. The kicker for me is the alcohol, which in my opinion is far too prevalent. Im still going to give this one a big overall score, because the craft and history behind this beer are unmistakable. I have a bottle of the 8 in the fridge right now; Im curious to say the least.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","FistFullOfCats"

Ar=4, Ap=4, F=9, P=5, O.A.=16
I think my first attempt at this beer was marred by a beer that suffered from improper storage conditions combined with a sinfully long shelf-life.  My second attempt at this masterpiece is as follows:

Very dark, cloudy pine bark-esque color.   Has the consistency and appearance of a melted swiss chocolate.  A beautiful fluffy tan head gently rests on top.  Amazing aromas of raisin, plum, full leaf roasted tobacco, and vanilla greet the nose and then are complemented by a brown sugar sweetness with some cinnimony spice.  One of the most amazing aspects of this beer is that the aromas tickle the nostrils while the beer is flowing out of the bottle and into the glass.  Oh wow, the flavors are overwhelming.  Chocolate, prune, and allspice stick to the tongue, followed by a Sumatran coffee astringent bite.  A gentle smack of banana and blueberry is noticed after a very long, drawn out malty finish.  Heavenly.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Poured light brown. Thin white head, that lasted around the edges to give it nice lacing on the side of the galss. Aroma was sweet, and fruity.  Flavor was tasted of plums and hints of another dark fruit that I couldnt get, also picked up caramel hints. As it warmed it had a nice not overpowering alcohol warming, also the plum hints were more pronounced. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Carbonation was good, all the bubbles gave it a cloudy appearance, when I finished I noticed sediment in the bottom of the glass.","Pennsylvania, USA","SB"

Nose is complicated:  Candied citrus peel, chocolate, an almost musty morel mushroom note, and something that smells almost meaty to me. The flavor is the most complex of any beer I have ever had.  Malt predominates at the beginning, along with candy sugar and dark fruit.  The fruit takes over soon, dried plums, raisin, and later grape, like an old merlot.  This is all mixed in with an underlying immistakable yeastiness to the beer.  Hops character comes in later, as does the rather strong alcoholic presence, that manages to make itself known without being overbearing.  Very heavy on the palate.  Finish lasts forever.

2854,"2005-12-09",4.2,"I enjoyed this, my 100th tasting on ratebeer, with my friend and neighbor elnadeau.

Pour was cloudy root-beer, somewhat muddy (elnads word, not mine but I agree).  Very light and foamy head with a nose full of vanilla and cider spices -- cinnamon, allspice, bit of nutmeg.  Underlying the spice are wet woods, cedar and fruit.  Mouth was also like a cider with wood dominant flavors and tobacco.  The body of this beer is terriffic, very smooth and silky with exteremely soft carbonation.  A nice complete and well-rounded beer.","Laguna Niguel, California, USA","chilehead"
2854,"2005-12-08",4.7,"Just exelent beer. Strong, sweet and just wonderfull. The only beer whom has bettered this for me, is the majestic Westvleteren Abt12. But this comes very close, and is much easier to get a hold on. Allthough it holds 11.2% alcohol it does not taste alcoholic. A beer that goes fine by its own, as an alternativ to a good glas of wine. Tastes best at 12-14 degrees, even warmer.","DENMARK","slotman"
2854,"2005-12-05",4.4,"11.2 oz bottle.  Poured a dark brown color.  Tan head was smaller than other reviewers reported but small amount of ""fuzz"" did remain for the entire experience.  Aromas of fig, raisin, port, and dried flowers.  Great black licorice and malt flavors with a pleasant warm alcohol feel.  Great cold weather beer.  I had high expectations from this one and can now say its one of the best Ive tasted to date.  I look forward to the 6 and 8.","Maumee, Ohio, USA","EBates"

Complex flavor profile of dark fruits, port wine, licorice and a surprisingly subtle alcohol presence. Light, fine carbonation balances a medium/full body. The finish dries out, leaving a lasting wonderfull bitterness.

Re-rated 5/27/07. My first rating of this beer still is pretty much unchanged. However, I did not fully appreciate the richness of the mouthfeel. The fruity flavors and aromas are just immense in this beer. I let the bottle warm for nearly an hour before opening, as it had been in my beer fridge for a few days. The finish is only lightly bitter, with a pleasing, but not overpowering dryness.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

Its not that it doesnt have as much depth or complexity; I just prefer the flavors in stouts.  This one did, however, have one of the best aromas Ive ever come across; very complex fruity, malty, alcoholic scents.  Feel in mouth was thick, with fairly sharp carbination.

This beer is packed with star anise, wintergreen, caramel, raisins, flums, black mission figs and a strong spicey currant base.

Slight fruit in there too but nothing I can really put too much of a handle on. Alcohol is clearly there but never too much. A sweet chunky gem!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
2854,"2005-09-18",4.6,"Pours deep brownnearly blackwith a large, rocky, tan head that stays there. A leather and plum/prune aroma hit me first, then raisins, chocolate, candy sugar, and some brandy-like alcohol. Huge flavor. The alcohol lets you know its there, but also lets the other flavors through unimpeded. Dark fruits and sweet chocolate are the most noticeable, but there is also some vanilla, oak, and lighter fruit. Very dry, raisiny finish. The alcohol is less noticeable as it warms, allowing everything else to come forward and mix perfectly. Dances on the tongue like alliteration in smooth and satisfying steps.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"

Good in mouth with toffee and chocolate, but the burning alcohol I find too much. Like the difference between the Westy 8 and 12, by having less it gives you so much more.

2854,"2005-09-10",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2006 I wouldnt recommend this for beginners/newbies.  I know that I, as beginner, would not have appreciated the subtlety and (dare I say it?) complexity of this world-class contribution to the beer world.  It actually transcends its categorization as ""beer.""  This is so far removed from beer as traditionally understood that it needs a different classification altogether.  Im probably not the first to say it, either.  I served this up in a very bulbous glass meant presumably for St. Bernardus tastings.  Unbelievable head on this, very slowly diminishing to a perfect foam layer.  (I play Mozart violin concertos as I appreciate the sublimity of this offering.)  From the top, its very dark cherry color, maybe plum; from the side, its dark maroon, even brownish if I may say so.  The aroma is what kills me.  Its choc full of fruit of some kind or other.  Im guessing raisin and plum, but it could be apricot or peach in there as well.  The aroma is striking in any event.  Candied fruit.  Flavor isnt a letdown at all, after this tantalizing introduction.  Alcohol miraculously well-hidden.  Smoother than silk on the palate.  Eminently deserving of its status as top ""accessible"" beer.  Unless you really like being walloped over the noggin with hops, as I do, the grace and mild-mannered deliciousness of this Trappist remains unsurpassed.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"
2854,"2005-09-09",4.7,"The other great beer Paul and I tasted at the Hopleaf in Chicago. Had it alongside the Westvleteren 12. I thought this beer was very similar the the W12, read my review of the W12 and youll get the general idea. Tasted a bit more acidic/sharper than the W12, also an apple ciderish aroma, palate was a bit thinner than W12, and again, no hops I could discern, all yeast and malt. What I failed to mention with the W12, I could not tell this beer was so alcoholic, both this beer and W12 were both very smooth.  $12/11.2oz bottle, but about $6 at the liquor store on Addison and Leavitt.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","beernightscout"

Flavor is a wide mix of plum, yeast, raisin, bread, and some port wine.  Its a good beer, but there are comparable Belgians out there  that Ive had, although I do admit this one is a bit smoother on the palate and more forceful and noticeable as it trickles down the throat than most Ive had.

Looks like yeast but one can never be too sure! Smell is very malty, with deep fruit undertones and a bit of alcohol. Some chocolatiness is present as well. Flavor hits you like a bulldozer with intense malt, rich spiciness. Definite sweetness about midway through but dissipates into an almost non-existant finish.

Taste, this is worth noting, it started very stealthy, dark fruits, and some malts, but going down it is smooth, almost unbelivably so. The world slowed to a crawl around me and for what seemed like an eternity there was nothing be me and the beer. I heard a buzzing in my ears and noticed my friend what talking to me, I told him to give me a minute.

More well balanced as it warms w/ raisiny, alcohol, and toasted malt flavors.  Lingering bitter aftertaste w/ some yeasty and bready malt notes..  Alcohol is very present.  Smooth at first, but becomes dry and borderline astringent between the hops & alcohol.  Higher level of carbonation and mediumb body.

The head was very generous, and showed no signs of receding (in fact there were still traces remaining when I polished it off about 30 minutes later - bloody phone!!). A glorious roasted malt taste, with molasses and spicy fruits. The flavour is slightly bitter, but only so much as too say ""drink more"". Quite a creamy feel in the mouth, although all this conceals a deadly alcoholic kick. The end of this glass was seemingly more pleasant than the beginning, but Im not sure whether its due to the content tending to the ambient temperature (a warm winters night) or the alcohol coursing through my veins. A brilliant, but expensive drink.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"

Very strong palate, more choclate, dark malts, with a slightly aggressive alcohol kick at the back. Just a bit to hot for my liking at the finish, buring a little. No matter, a very good beer with layered flavours. I think I may agree with the taster before me...the 8 may be a better drop. A side note....my wife has an extremely seasoned palate when it comes to wine (shes a wine retailer by trade) but drinks buggar all beer.

Quite an alcoholic flavour of raisin pie (yes, it exists) with spicy pumpernickel.  Subtle banana esters and floral accents.

The nose is very complex. Many aromas subtely lace together and with each sniff youll discover something new. Licorice, raisin, apple, plum, caramel... A sweet and distinctive fruity nose. As you take your first sip the perfect carbonation gently tickles the tip of your tongue and the mouthfeel gradually becomes fluffy and light. As it moves to the back of your tongue you begin to notice the body of this beer: rich and slightly bitter. The malty flavors start to appear, caramel, honey and coffee blend with the dark fruits. The balance in this brew is perfect. As you swallow, a silky smooth and creamy aftertaste settles on your tongue while a toasty feeling subsides in your stomach. Truly exquisite. The high alcohol content (11.3%) is extremely well hidden.

The flavor had interesting notes of bourbon, brandy, molasses, Belgian candy, alcohol, and pine sap (not all that pleasing really, perhaps because of the alcohol but more likely because of the body).  Strange, as I turely like all those flavors.  Just not in this combination or beer.  The body was more carbonated than I expected, and was lightly syrupy but watery after that.  Just not the wonderful beer I expected for #200.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Poured with very little head, but I was over-cautious after pouring an over-exuberant Achel Bruin/8 - slightly off-white foam, quick dissipating to a lovely skirl on the top.  Very dark, slightly cloudy strong black tea colour, some bubbling and a little fine sediment at the end of the pour - I poured it all out (Im not wasting this!!) and nothing visible in the bottom of my goblet.  Aroma is ... complex.  Malt (slightly sweet), chocolate, a bit of raisin, clove and spice, more I cant put my finger on.  No alcohol in the bouquet to my nose (astonishing for an %11.3).  A touch of  yeast initially, quickly gone.  Flavour is .. superb.  A bit of yeast, but mostly cloves and mixed spices, aged malt, enough bitterness to balance, hint of decent white wine.  Finishes perfectly - gradual easing off of all of the above.  A beautiful Belgian - the only thing Ive tasted better (once!!!!) was the Westvleteren ABT 12, and this is pretty close.  I want another case!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

2854,"2005-06-19",5.0,"A winter favourite of mine, I seemed to have amassed around twenty bottles over the last 3 years and found I only drink one every few months. But alas it is truly an experience I savour deeply with each time. (Bottle 12/10/08) Poured it into a short tulip straight from the cellar (?14 degrees) on a cold winters night. Deep brown body, almost black, and opaque with a quickly settling loose pad of yeast. Head forms straight from the pour, sandy-beige and a good ¾"". Sticks around for the entire length and produces a good web of lace. Strong, almost pungent, vinous-chocolate aroma with a hefty waft of alcohol and yeast spices, dried fruit esters and a little earthy malt. The aroma continues expansion as I downed it and leans more towards a mixture of chocolate, nuts and warming alcohol. Big in the mouth, flavours eat right into every crevice and blend beautifully with assistance from the medium spritzy carbonation and silky smooth mouth feel. A little nutty and earthy, the pleasantly warming alcohol seems to compliment the chocolate, raisins, sultanas, low bitter hop and malt notes and toasted grains of this wonderful beer. Finishes off with a long, warming, dessert style chocolate and fruit swallow that surely shakes off the winter blues. This is easily one of my favourites and I just cannot fault it (second 5.0).

I find Rochefort  superior to Westvletern. It is wetter and thus more drinkable (to me) and its flavors meld more smoothly together. The candy sugar and raisin asspects are not quite as intense in the Rochefort which makes it a very pleasant beer to drink The 10 is definitely the star, but all Rocheforts offering share similar qualities in flavor and palate.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

This beer coated the mouth well, and the beer was rather heavily-bodied.  Same fruits in the flavor as in the nose, but there was also a spiciness that was not previously noted.  This was a mean beer because the fantastic flavor and mouthfeel made me anxiously await the subsequent sip, and this beer packs a punch.  Nice warming effect going down.

2854,"2005-04-30",4.2,"Bottle, best before sometime in 2009 (hinting that I shouldnt be drinking it just yet). I shouldnt be rating this, as I am recovering from a cold, however I decided to go ahead anyway because I think the beer has aided in my recovery. Only disappointment in the appearence was the small head. What was there laced pretty well. Deep effervescent chocolate amber colour made up for the disappointing head. Aroma, um, well, big! Spices, toffee, raisins, flowers, alcohol... Taste - um, well, huge! And it needs to be to get in before the alcohol which is considerable and smacks you in the face at the finish. Despite the big, warm, dry, (kinda like Australia) alcoholic finish, the balance remains very good, which is a big achievement. I think this is assisted by the fine carbonation which leads to a lush yet subtle feel. Would love to taste the same batch in 2009 to see what has changed.

2854,"2005-04-10",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2006 Im worried about this bottle. The others that were with it were questionable, spending potential months in a blazing florescent cooler. My fears are being assuaged by the growing pearly off-white head that is mounting up the glass. What a ridiculous color for a beer. A yeast-spotted wine color, with fringes of golden wheat color and deep pits of dark, syrupy port. The aroma is average, with a sweet malt dominating, backed up by very light warm rum. On the tongue, it starts off slow then crescendos into this symphony of warm flavors. The mellow malt and sugar start the run off, with a light orange and raisins. It grows and glows into a pitching yeasty fervor, with good fresh bread tones and a general fruit ensemble. The alcohol is not hidden, but does not detract from the beer in anyway; instead it adds another level of complexity and warmth. It awakens the nose and makes the palate pay attention. The flavors finish up with some cardamom and clove over that well spoken of black currant. Im highly impressed with this beers general suave sophistication and the level to which the alcohol improves the flavor, adding a velvety smoothness to the whole profile. A little of that licorice Jagermesiter floats in on the palate, leaving a sweet, sugary film on the back of the tongue that beckons for more and more. Yet, this sweetness is strangely balanced out by light oaky dryness, so you dont feel overwhelmed with sugar. The carbonation which maintains in this beer does a fantastic job of distributing the flavor throughout the mouth. As it warms, new tones and flavors arrive and depart from this train station of complexity. New dancing fruits, ripe plum, mellow apricot, and sweet pears. All backed with a light reserved savory complexion. Could a beer get any better than this? At least this bottle survived.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Color is dark brown and the head is medium at best but fades quickly and leaves no lacing. The tastes is strong and has some wonderful and not so wonderful characteristics. You are first greeted by a bitter grassyness not unlike sake (not so wonderful) which is then followed by sweet malt and floral hop (wonderful). There is a strong alcohol taste that dominates ever aspect of this beer and the finish has a return of the unpleasant grassy bitterness. This is the only beer I have ever had that was sweet and dry at the same time. The aftertaste is short and has just a hint of maltiness. Highbrow but not high-class.

Aroma initially seemed lighter than might be expected from the 11.3% abv, but complex. Very sweet, with juicy dark berries (blackcurrants), molasses and some peppery alcohol, like a young shiraz. In fact, the aroma is very wine-like. The more I sniffed, the more I appreciated. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy. Initial flavour impression is of dark fruit - figs, raisins - followed by a hint of spice. Then theres that almighty rush of alcohol that hits you in the throat, then down in the gut.

It is surprisingly smooth and drinkable for how complex the flavour is.    I was expecting it to be heavy based on the colour and flavour, but found it to be surprisingly light.

Poured dark chocolate brown with a light khaki head that started at about 1"". Lots of suspended particles, some of which are rather large. The foam clings to the side of the glass when it recedes. Beautiful, long legs.  Wonderful aroma of malt, raisin, very ripe dark fruits, cookie dough, and spices. The initial impression in the mouth is of a substantial mouthful and fullness. The taste is, at first, cookie dough, a mild malt sweetness, then as the beer moves across the tongue there are a plethora of other flavors. This isnt just a sweet, malty beer; it has some assertiveness to it.  The secondary flavors are, at first, almost like a BIG red wine, then spicy, those dark fruits such as plums and raisins emerge along with an almost peppery flavor, along with a glimpse of alcohol.  The finish is spicy, mildly alcoholic, with a lingering dryish flavor and some hops character.  This is one of the better balanced big Belgian beers I have had; most tend to be very malty.

2854,"2004-12-22",4.8,"Ill start off first by saying that I am partial to rich, complex, full-bodied beers.  I crave layers.  I 

want dimension.  I want to be able to look into every corner of the beer and find something worthy of 

mentioning.  To me, the difference between a craft beer and a world-class beer is that a while a craft beer 

may be an excellent example of a particular style, and therefore enjoyable cum that particular style, a 

world-class beer is an oeuvre on the palate that can provide the culinary depth of an entire meal in one 

quaff.

All this to say, Rochefort 10 is such a beer.  

From the deep mahagony color (dare I say it reminded me of buffed koa wood from Hawaii?), one expects that 

the malt should shine through, and from the nose one waits to taste spices of all different kinds.  One is 

not disappointed.  The first thing that I noticed in this beer is how well the brewer has stood up to the 

formidable 11% alcohol content; unfortunately most high-alcohol beers will have the experience of ethanol in 

center state, as the lead singer, with the rest of the flavors singing backup, however Rochefort 10 is in 

control of the alcohol content and uses it to strong advantage.  There are of course raisin tones, and plums, 

but factor in the chocolate and you have gourmet Raisinettes.  The tastes have a matte finish, rather than 

glossy; everything is balanced and textured rather than bright and zinging.  More tastes follow - muted strawberries, ripe banana, and of course a highly pleasureable layered maltiness.  At first drink I was tempted to say that the finish was dry, but it wasnt.  It was clean, as if it were purposeful.  One gets the sense that everything is in its place, nothing is an accident.  This is a wonderful beer, practiced and perfected.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","poivre"

There is also a couple of notes spiciness to the scent and a couple of other smells that were not identified. Leading the way in the taste is a fruity sweetness that is also accompanied by a doughy malt flavor and slight bit of spice. It has a bit of a dry finish and a buttery taste going on as well. Very refreshing to sip on this warm day and no trace of alcohol anywhere. Mouthfeel is rich and about medium to full in body. It goes down very easy and is a very balanced beer.

The body is massively thick, yet soft. Buttery smooth, again with the brown bread, merlot and other red wines, alcohol is quite prominent (as you would expect) and burns slightly for several minutes of each sip. The flavor changes drastically as it warms, and is certainly much more complex over time.  The finish lingers, malty as all hell, dry finish with some oolong tea flavors (seriously).

2854,"2004-09-17",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2004 Theres no doubt that this is an excellent beer...although I do agree that it might be overrated.  Specifically I mean, that this is definitely a top 50 beer, but I feel it should not be in the top 20.  It does have a unique taste (to me the preeminent flavor is grape / raisin).  For how high the alcohol content is, the flavor remains divnely sweet and has no harshness.  It is difficult to explain my feelings for this beer ... I really enjoyed the experience, but definitely have many favorites that have a more unique identity.  Memorable and recommendable, but not the powerhouse I was eagerly expecting.  Nonetheless I had to come back and update my rating ... this beer deserves more than I gave initially.","USA","Loddeer"

The palate was medium, with a smooth, fairly crisp finish.  Also finishes with more fruit and well hidden alcohol.

2854,"2004-09-06",4.8,"Second Review:
Pours a dark opaque brown with a thick, creamy, tan head. The head dwindles and leaves lacing that is thick and clingy; CO2 only visible along the edge of the head. Aroma is malty, roasted, spicy and some hints bubblegum. The flavors are sweet, roasted, fruit, spicy. Sweet start with a tart middle and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and effervescent. A definite warming presence of alcohol. A great beer with a lot of character; complex but not overpowering.
Well-balanced and intense without being over the top.

First Review:
Presentation: 33cl brown bottle with freshness date of 26/08/08

Deep brown color a light brown head with signs of light carbonation. The head diminished to a fine layer quickly leaving a nice band of lace around the glass. Aroma is initially astringent and wine like, but more complex smells and flavors emerge as the beer warms: fruity bubblegum notes, dried fruits and caramel and an earthy background. Flavor is complex and full: sweet fruity and caramel start with a quick tart middle and a lingering tangy hop finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy with an alcohol finish and a surprising amount of effervescence.","New Mexico, USA","igel"

2854,"2004-09-04",4.7,"Fizzy in the glass, no appreciable head.  Sweet aroma of raisins and jam.  Deep brown - red-brown. Hot alcohol on the front end, with a flash of oak, then a parade of flavors that range from sauteed mushrooms to sweet red wine and some magnificent dessert with chocolate and fruit.  All sorts of foresty flavors that I cant place.  Alcohol character is fleeting, but felt all the way into your soul.  For my 100th beer Ill give this a ""20"".

Dark muddy brown with a decent lace coming off an off white head.

Big prickle in the mouth, with a lingering and well lasting, and um, long, long, finish. Vanilla, chocolate, plum, invade your mouth soflty but leave massive flavors behind, as caramel, coffee, raisen, and other pleasant flavors dance their way out on the finiish.

This crap was way too expensive for a mini botttle of beer.  It wasnt bad, however it didnt deserve the high ratings (in my opinion) and it wasnt worth the price.

Poured a deep, hazy brown, in my trappist glass, with a small head, which quickly dissipated, leaving a thin, creamy layer, along with moderate carbonation. I left the last 1/2 inch in the bottle, as it contained the majority of the sediment. Smell was warm, doughy bread, with raisins, prunes, alcohol, and a hint of coriander.  Marvelous. Medium palate, with a lively carbonation.  Flavor was dark fruits, similar to the smell, with a warm, moderately strong, alcohol bite and a mild acidic finish.  Great stuff!!

2854,"2004-08-02",5.0,"I really dont know what to say.  Never have I tasted anything like this.  In the glass it was a delicious dark brown with a generous creamy white head and lots of suspended yeasty solids.  The aroma and flavor were indescribable, but Ill do my best.  The nose was a rich complex aroma of cinnamon, raisin, apple, and dark fruit, blended with a overriding sweet floral perfume.  The ensuing flavor mirrored much of the aroma, with complex frutiness and a lightly-roasted maltiness openning into a fragrant rose-garden nectar sensation, then finally finishing in a twinge of sharp alcohol.  The liquid was thick and full in my mouth, truly like nectar.  I am totally amazed.  Being a relatively new and inexperienced beer afficianado, I didnt realize that beer like this exists.  It is quite an epiphany, shaking the foundation of my knowledge of beer.  I feel now that this pushes all my other ratings out of proportion; they should all be lower to make room for this beer and some of its trappist cousins that I have yet to try.  Monks, I salute you.

2854,"2004-07-30",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2005 Bottle, Ciros, Toronto.  Dark brown / purple colour.  Fantastic aroma, lots of spice, plum, and slight alcohol.  Very little head on the pour in a nice trappist style glass.  Mouthfeel was a little disappointing in that it was thinner than the appearance suggested, but still it was complex without being syrupy.  Lots more spice and warm alcohol in the taste - I couldnt really describe it, but I knew it seemed well balanced and quite agreeable.  This beer got better as it warmed as well - the flavours were less intense, but by the end, I couldnt identify the 11% alcohol level.  A nice experience with good company.

Re-rate April 20 05.  Acquired a bottle in a trade with Mustang3.  My initial rating of this was when I was still at a pretty infant stage as far as trying new styles were concerned.  The bottle I had last night absolutely blew me away in a way no beer has.  The appearance of this beer was quite different, as I was in my well-lit living room and not a dark enjoyable bar.  It was very dark brown with red hues and a murkiness that looked fantastic. Small tan head.  The aroma was amazing - fresh hops, sweet malt, a little spice and some alcohol - Ive never wanted to try a beer based on its aroma before so bad in my life.  The mouthfeel was also very unique - full-bodied, yet really frothy - this is where I encountered the biggest difference in my 2 ratings.  The taste was of rich malt, a well-balanced bitterness and the alcohol was incredibly restrained.  There was almost a sweet rum like quality to this beer.  I have not done it justice, but this was without question the best beer I have ever tried.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

Great body, full of complex flavours: chocolate covered strawberries, honey-buttered toast and caramel-toffee clusters; all wrapped in a delicate (though strong) blanket of alcohol.  Wonderful yeast complexities take control in the finish  it makes me wonder  the secrets of these monks: how old is the yeast they use, where did it come from, how has it changed through the agesanyway back to the present/now: this beer is truly amazing.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"

2854,"2004-07-24",4.2,"7/24/04.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, bought at Liquorama in Upland, CA 7/22/04.  Pours to a deep, dark burgundy red with an explosive light tan, densely frothy head.  Lacing is superb.  Aroma is spicy and vaguely reminiscent of a red ale; some sort of cinnamon bread, unsweetened brown sugar (does that shit exist??), and definitely some alcohol, but its also cakey and dessert-like.  I wish it jumped off of the beer more, but it is pretty elegant nonetheless.  Initial taste is sharply alcoholic and surprisingly potent, but also very smooth to the palate, especially considering the creamy head.  Incredibly rich, dark liqueur cake and trace nutty flavors, as well as some blunted fig and raw earth shading.  Harsh pepper tickles on top, and thin spectres of alcohol dances around the mouth throughout the experience.  Very full body with a yeasty presence in the finish, subsiding to a faintly bready rounded flavor.  Very long.  Some flavors of flour and nuts.  Nice balance of sweetness and dryness-- it almost suggests a much stronger sweetness than it actually gives off.  Very interesting.

2854,"2004-07-10",4.5,"BBD 04 03 08  A beer I look forward to with great anticipation every time.  Almost goosebumps.  As I drink this deep brown ale, I play Calexico ""Stray"" & ""Bloodflow"" over and over, each time bumping the volume up just a bit.  As the beer warms, it seems like it gets a notch louder as well.  In the fridge for 3 weeks, sat on the counter unopened for 35-40min, allowed to breathe in the glass for 5 min, and I spend another 5min cupping the glass in my hands and smelling it before I drink.  Bloodflow.  As I sip my mind becomes hazy, dreamlike.  A moment 2 years ago in Porte Noire flashes through my head, but I cant catch the memory, I dont recognize it & I wonder ""does it taste ike last time?"" This gives way to another lost thought.  I turn back to the beer.  It warms me.  It doesnt hide its secrets like Houdini, it just gathers me in its long, black cape of luscious smoke filled bricked rooms of malt, waves of dried plums in the street, you can feel this beer.  Almost as good as the moonshine I drank for a length of time on 4 July w/ my friends fathers, mothers, sisters, brother Ted.  I admit it. Im partial to this beer.

And its outstanding.

Large light sandy head. Fair lacing throughout.

Hazy body that rolls from dark brown to blood red.

That aroma - allspice, plums, a shovel full of malt.

And then the fun really begins; a sweetness bites the tounge, liquid christmas pud coats your throat, as it rasps its way down your lips are still stinging. That duel carries on long afterwards, an unsurpassed finish.

The alcohol does cut through - and so it should at this level - and so what meakes this beer truly great is the warming way in which it does so, never raw, never blatant, always measured, controlled and in harmony.

2854,"2004-06-05",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2012 Well I had to do it at some point.  The beer that Ive always thought of as the best taste Ive ever had.  Id not had a bottle for 2 years or so and was going to save drinking this until a special number, but after pestering the steward of the club where I drink to get some in, I just had to take some of his hands.  I really was nervous that my memory had deceived me and that I didnt enjoy it as much as I thought, and my very first impression was a tad dissappointing as, although the colour was a beautiful black/brown, there was just not enough head.  First point dropped then.  However the aroma is just wonderful - coal, licquorice, spices, chocolate and a tad of sourness.  10/10 no question.  The taste and flavour though are the things we remember from past experiences, and this was going to be the crux issue.  And wow - it didnt let me down - I knew it wouldnt really.  There is so much flavour in there; most of the things in the aroma are replicated, including the coal, especially the coal!  There is fruitiness, sourness, spiciness and alcohol in abundance and all wonderfully balanced.  It is just a sumptuous beer.  If Westy 12 is as good as this I cannot wait!  I had three bottles back to back as it was so good.  No hangover this morning either even on top of the two other Belgies Id drank in advance.  Just lovely, lovely, lovely.  Score 4.9Subsequent rating also scored 4.9","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
2854,"2004-06-05",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2006 Re-Rate. Bottle, Oud Arsenaal, Antwerpen.  Almost two years later, and my overall rating didnt change.  This one is mostly flavor, as the peripherals (body, smell, looks) arent special: burnt caramel and smoky wood chips, sweet milk without its creaminess, and alcohol burn on the back of the tongue.  Like the 8, this one seemed hollow and weak the whole way, too watery and thin.  Fortunately, this one had some taste.  6/3/8/4/14 = 3.5

Original Rating. Like Oakes, I dont think theres much that I can say thats different, but for posterity, Ill make a few notes.  The alcohol in this beer is very noticeable, especially on the finish, and I think it takes away from the wonderfully balanced flavors in the front.  The appearance is sumptuous, and if the finish didnt ruin the experience for me, I would rate this one as high as most others have.  As it is, Im just hoping to swill it as fast as I can by the end of the glass, which is unfortunate, since theres so much quality before the finish.  Thats just my personal taste, however.  4/4/7/4/16 = 3.5","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
2854,"2004-06-04",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2010 Bottle:  Aroma is extremely fruity with a strong presence of alchohol.  Also some chocolate in the aroma.  Pours a dark brown color with a big tan head with excellent lacing.  Flavor is initially sweet with a strong alcohol finish.  Some chocolate flavor as well.  Im not real big on the strong alcohol finsih but other than that this beer is pretty good.  Not 4.4 good though.  I prefer the 8 or 6.  Original rating of 8-3-7-3-15

Finally decided to try this again and do a re-rate since I assume my palate has adjusted after sampling close to 1200 beers since my original rating.  Aroma has lots of fruit with grape being the stongest.  Notes of caramel and chocolate too.  Pours a deep ruby with with a huge creamy off-white head with great retention and excellent lacing.  How did I ever give this a 3 in appearance?  Flavor has lots of fruit and like the aroma, grape is the strongest with some plum.  Caramel and chocolate hide in the background.  Alcohol does not seem anywhere near as strong as I originally thought but some warmth is still there in the finish.  Not much different from my original rating outside of appearance (I have no idea what I saw the first time) and palate.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

 Raisins, and Dates.. Caramelized brow sugar, butterscotch, candied apples. A plethora of chocolate malts, some Coke a Cola notes, a toasty biscuit, yeasty and full!

The aroma is deliciously fruity, with plums, cherries, raisins, and licorice notes.  The taste is delicately balanced between fruitiness of the malt and spiciness of the yeast.

The aroma is slightly estery yet balanced by a rich malt character announcing the wonderful roasted/chocolate flavors to come.  Slightly sweet to the taste yet balanced by an odd metalic flavor.  This very well could be my favorite beer ever.  I wouldn't mind ""fasting"" with this one for a while.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fomentateur"
2854,"2004-04-02",4.1,"Shared bottle with my brother...Dark nearly opaque pour with a generous head.  Aroma of raisins and macerated pit fruit (apricots, plums, peaches), definate alcohol on the nose.  Alcohol is hidden nicely though on the palate, same tastes as the aroma, with definate complexity.  A solid beer with very redeeming characteristics.","Chazy, New York, USA","ChazyRPh"
2854,"2004-04-02",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2007 Best by 04 03 08: Aroma is caramel, brown sugar, yeasts, spices, and banana.  Pour is a hazy mahogany with a robust beige head.  Start is somewhat sweet, then bitter with some hops.  Smokey Alcohol finish.  There is indeed a lot going on here.  Unfortunately, the aftertaste is what leaves the lasting impression.  This is still a decent brew.----re-rate-- much else to add.  my original rate was pretty accurate.  Definitely ethanolic.  A bit thin and metallic with more hops than expected.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
2854,"2004-03-30",4.3,"Thanks Joey Capps for letting me try this one! Dark, dark body, almost a reddish brown....I am going to say a dark ruby colour. Aroma is complex.A strong fruity scent is apparent. Smells like spiced plums or something similar. Taste is fruity, but like a wine. Very nice. Smooth from beginning to finish. An incredible beer.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
2854,"2004-03-29",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2004 Bottled (330ml). Like with other belgians, the alcohol is very well hidden, I find it easier to drink than some English ales with half the alcohol. Saying that, the alcohol is somewhat overpowering in the nose. The beer however, is sweet, malty and fruity. This is a very good beer, although not quite at the level of the Westvleteren 12. Since the westy 12 is a fair bit cheaper thawn this.. I think I'll go with that in the future :). Complex.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Joeh"
2854,"2004-03-29",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2005 (Bottled, BBE 09/2009) Very dark brown, but not opaque, color with a medium, beige, lasting head. Very strong initial licoricey herbiness that settles into sweetish, strong and caramely-toffeeish maltiness in a somewhat scotch ale -like way. A fantastic, strong and winous, very licoricey-malty, raisiny flavor with nice, spicy bitterness. Quite full-bodied, but not exactly thick, sweetish-sugary and bitter palate with medium carbonation. Well hidden ABV for its class. A truly excellent, warming and reasonably complex trappist, that is just an inch too thin from perfection. On the other hand, its quite easy to drink despite the 11.3%. Definitely a world class brew!
(Earlier rating, was 7-5-8-4-15=3.9) Very, very dark, deep red color with a medium, bubbly head. Malty, alcoholic, sourish, strong aroma. Burning alcohol flavor with raisins, dark chocolate and anise. Slightly sweet. Very full-bodied, oily and creamy palate. A very enjoyable trappist, but a bit too alcoholic.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
2854,"2004-03-29",4.5,"Incredibly complex aroma, mixing caramel, toffee, chocolate, pineapple, and perfume.  Pours super dark burgundy, almost black, with a monstrous but quickly disappearing head, which is reduced to a sudsy thin layer.  alcohol flavor is a little on the strong side, but it IS 11.3%, so taking that into account, it's downright smooth.","Oregon, USA","xsketchyx"
2854,"2004-03-25",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2005  After a few bottles (of various vintage) and a mediocre finish in a Abt/Quad shootout - time for a *slight* downgrade.  The richness and thickness are still there every time.  The aroma varies drastically with age. <P>
Having the ""6"", the ""8"" and the ""10"" all in my possession begs the question - where to start?  Work my way up the scale or down?  Providentially, my coin flip landed on heads - start from the top.  Bottle dated ""24 07 07"" (bottled July 2002). The pour was like extracting catsup from a Heinz bottle - glug,glug...Mighty thick stuff!  I think some of the spent yeast was suspended in there.   As expected, minimal head and lacing in this straight brown brew.  You name the fruit, it was in the aroma.   Plums and Cassis dominated, maybe even some pumpernickel bread in there.  Then came the first sip.  The response?  ""OhMyGodThisIsTheBestBeerEverToTouchMyVirginL  There was a moderate sweetness, a vinousness, with a touch of spice and aciditiy.  The mellowness that came with age was clearly present.  I didnt sense any dark chocolate bitterness as expected (a good thing to me).  I could feel the warmth as this syrup slithered down my throat, tickling on the way down.  I wonder if this could be requested as a last meal (all by itself)? Possibly administered by a monk who has devoted his life to prayer...my soul would be at rest.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
2854,"2004-03-24",4.7,"Pours a deep brown with a thin head. Aromas of plums, raisins, toasted malts.There were other scents but I could not define them. Needless to say the nose is quite complex. Then I took a sip. YE GODS! What a burst of flavours.

Every mouthful is a delight.The alcohol is well hidden.I wish i had another bottle because on is not enough.I would love to try this beer aged but i am too weak willed to have a bottle stored in my cellar.I enjoyed this beer more than i did than westvleteren 12.Luckily it is easier to get hold of than westvleteren.","DENMARK","oli"

The thin creamy brown head gave way for the chocolate cake like aroma.  as for flavor, yummy sweet plum, raisin, chocolate.  instead of a little hop bite i got a spicy finish with lingering alcohol, i guess the 11.3 % is what did it.  let this one warm up for another awesome experience.  I think if it was aged another 2 years or so i would've enjoyed as much as westvleteren 12 which is why i gave it a 17, but do not pass this one up.  cheers","USA","BIGC"

2854,"2004-03-08",4.5,"I can't imagine too many beers that would earn a 10 for flavor, but this beer does in my opinion.  Such a lush palate of fig, brown sugar, raisin and plum.  Its hard to tell by the bottle, how old this one was, but it seemed to be aged perfectly-but I only had it for a week.  Tried alongside a Bernardus 12 and I thought this one was noticably better. Wish I could afford a case of it.","Glen Ellyn, Illinois, USA","HopasaurusRex"
2854,"2004-03-08",4.3,"This pours out a molasses color yet settles in the glass barely brown, a very dark black coffee color in the glass with a tremendously large, thick billowing head of dark cream with speckles in it. The top settles and softens to look like melted vanilla ice cream(whipped) and the lacing is one continuing thick curtain around the entire glass with amazing sticking power. One divine looking glass of ale!  Softer then soft nose, nothing to powerful, subtle and soft, appetizing and engaging, ever changing and new; soft fruits of pear, apple, and mango, touches of plum, fig, and raisin, deeper is some spices but light, some cocoa, continues to get more lively as it warms, grabbing light phenolic notes, cookie sugars, and yeast.  Taste is calm and soothing with many hidden subtleties, soft yet kinda darkish bakers chocolate dominates the front and middle with some caramel with a bit of light breadish qualities. Finish is all over the place, as the chocolate wears off a slight appearance of light tropical fruits dash in before reaching the peak of both feel, body, and taste where it mingles with yeasty spicyness, yet some chocolate remains behind drying slightly in the finish, and very late are yet more spices with an little extra burn of good Ol' alcohol, and thats the only place that 11.3% shows itself. And yet it continues, there are many wonderful things that float around once its been there a while including some nice caramel coating the back of the tongue. Nice! As in the smell, there is nothing overpowering, just a bunch of soothing character and subtlety thats just as savory as a really great, chewy homemade cookie. Feel is super smooth with a very fluffy, almost floating in texture feel, close to medium yet seeming full body. The texture and body reminds me of the soft graham cracker used for ice cream sandwiches. If you've ever just ate the dimpled brown graham cracker part by itself, this is what I'm talking about. Nice smoothness overall.  Which brings me to its drinkabilty - it has alot of that! Wow, very scrumptious, just thick enough, fluffy, and glides down with astounding ease. Moderate overall really, in my book, was hoping for a bit more, and the Rochefort 8 I like just a bit more; still this is very quenchable and wouldn't pass it up for nothing. Price wise it might be? $8 for 11.2 ounces it's almost worth it here.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

I tried this at a cafe just outside of Brugge at a beer festival in Dilksmuide, and the flavor (and perhaps the alcohol content) just knocked my socks off.  Its been a little over a year since I tried it, but how could I forget the wonderful, earthy brown color in that goblet of a Trappist glass, or that wonderful, ineffable aroma.

Aroma: has been tempting me ever since I opend the bottle. moderate maltiness, wonderful use of hops, smells like fruity perfume, wonderful!

Taste: hard to put my finger on, although it is fantastic. sweet and sour at the same time. slight alcohol flavor at the finish, but compliments well. wonderfully thematic. Overall, i am very likely to purchase again, great price for a world class beer.  I just had one that I had been saving for three years, amazing, best best beer in the world.

2854,"2004-01-20",4.4,"About as opaque as a non-stout beer can be; The dark mahogany color omits all light except for a very tiny ring of red at th surface where the glass is widest.  Head is fahioned of microbubbles of white and cream, already some lacing is on the glass.  The aroma is tremendous and stately: insane amounts of malt, along with pit fruit, cherries and prodigous alcohol. Taste begins like a strong cough syrup because of the high ABV but quickly the true colors of the palate shine tough: sweet malt, grapes, brown sugar, dates, and aggressively bitter and roasted hops.  Taste never gets chewy or syrupy because the high amount of alcohol works as a thinning agent. This is remarkable because so much flavor exists on such a thin sheet.  Aftertaste is alcohol, grapes, chocolate, finishing on a dark roast coffee note.  This is definately a sipping beer, with each swig blasting my sensory detectors like a 4 ounce gulp of [insert powerful beer here]. The lacing is the best I've ever seen by a Belgian. Certainly worth a try if you can find it, though it is not the ultimate drinking beer experience I had thought it might be.

Sure it doesnt have the same mistique but its superb.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

landscape to admire. very dark brown, burnt orange, and lively body. the flavor is 

complex and full - sweet, nuts, caramel, fruits, alcohol, spice, ... aftertaste is most of all salty and dry, but with 

all its other flavors as well. the last few drinks become so smooth like velvet, alcohol turns into licorice, and again all those other complexities never fade away. basically, it's all together for a wonderful balance. i very

2854,"2003-12-26",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2005 Poured a dark brew with a nice foamy white head with excellent retention time. Complex aroma of spice and roastiness arose from my glass. Taste of spice is complex and alcohol taste is subtle which is great achievement at 11.3%. Body if full and support well the mix of spice from this beer. Always great to review a trappist beer when they are so perfect as this one clearly is. Wow!!!

Original Rating:
Dark brown, with a long lasting toffee head. One of  the most perfect beers Ive ever had. Alcohol well disguised but present. Lacks the syrup character that many Belgians have; instead complex, fruity, and beyond my ability to describe. Jokes, you rock for sending this to me as Secret Santa.","Arlington, Texas, USA","jzzbassman"
2854,"2003-12-22",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2004 Pours with a medium head that fades to a thin but ever present layer of small bubbles. Aroma of sweet dough, dark fruit, and black licorice. Flavor of rich dark fruit and licorice with some mild tea like spice in the finish. There is an alcoholic warmth that never shows itself as a burn but is always just behind the flavors. The palate is creamy and the body is medium, both get very slightly watery on the finish. One of the best belgians I have had, very drinkable and a rich delicious aroma and flavor.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
2854,"2003-12-21",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2004 Bottled.
Dark brown with a fine head.

A sweet, warm alko-feel.
A lot of spicies and juniper-berries in the flavour.","Billdal, SWEDEN","larsniclas"
2854,"2003-12-17",4.6,"WOW. Aroma was oodles of malt, plum and black currents (couldn't identify the currents 'til I read the commercial description but of course they are right.) Looks dark brown heading toward black with a big tan head that diminishes to a great size and leaves perfect lacing, almost  stout like in appearance. Massive amounts of malt permeat this fruity rich brew but the ever present alcohol and bitterness keep it from becoming a fruit cake. Perfectly carbonated and feels like a meal without being thick. I love doppelbocks but this could persuade me that Belgium makes the best beer.","Taylors Hill, AUSTRALIA","Choos"

Old and enjoyable.2013-02-12, L 210306, 12 years old, 7-5-8-4-16=40Dark brown color with medium sized head, compact but not too long retention. The aroma is quite deep, with caramel and accents of fruitcake. Good body strength; the mouthfeel is lean; good caramel and malt flavor, chestnut honey, hint of nuts, mild residual sweetness on the lips; the bitterness is quite low, but unnoticed; no oxidization apparently, or signs of age.A silky elegant brew; I could drink 5 of these tonight and not being bored.2012-06-09, bottle at Pibar, Lausanne, L 130514 13:44, 3 years old, 8-5-8-4-16=41Hazy dark amber color, medium sized compact head. The aroma is delicate, with notes of chocolate, caramel, malt, light yeast; more complex than the young Westvleteren XII tasted side-to-side. Good malt and mild chocolate flavor, moderate sweetness, maybe the bitterness is too low, there is a light feeling of oxidization. But its an excellent Belgian, although not impressive as other times.2011-05-04, L 051115 09:37, possibly less than one year old, 8-5-8-4-16=41Good caramel aroma, with nice yeast scent. Good body structure, present yet lean, with a very smooth mouthfeel; caramel flavor, avoiding the oxidisation trait of the Rochefort 8, and apparently ready to drink earlier than the lesser sister; the sweetness comes in later, with light liquorice traces. Very good alcohol control. The final delivers a dryish impression at first, rounder after some time.Although young, its already a good sipper.2010-04-14, L 110406, vintage 2001, 9 years old, 8-5-9-4-18=44The color is dark brown, impenetrable; the head is medium sized, creamy, it reduces quickly to a thin persistent layer. The aroma is full, malty, with light chocolate, and showing only the slightest sign of oxidisation. Full bodied, it has one of the richest malt flavors in beer, with caramel, delicate chocolate, candi sugar; sweet, smooth and round; traces of Belgian yeast. The bitterness is almost gone, the final is then short, but well balanced and still able to provide pleasure. The alcohol is almost not perceived. Delicious.2009-01-04,  bottle at La Pizzaccia, Como, 7-5-9-4-16=41Dark brown color with red shades; persistent head. The caramel aroma is rather simple, the flavor is much better; young it reaches the perfect balance between sweetness, bitterness and alcohol; caramel and malt flavor, chocolate cake.2003-12-10, bottle 1 year old, 9-5-9-5-18=46Dark amber color; big, creamy head. Very nice malty and fruity aroma, with delicate notes of caramel and roasted malts, oranges and spices. Full malty, without being too sweet; caramel and the balancing bitterness; light liquorice. Velvet pleasure. A perfect lesson for the North Americans, how to brew without excess, with perfect harmony of elements.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2854,"2003-12-15",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2008 Nice dark brown color with a small tan head. Big alcohol raisin taste. This is (in my opinion) the best of the Trappist ales.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2854,"2003-12-14",3.9,"This is a lightly hazy deep red - amber color when held up to the light.  It is dark amber to brown otherwise.  It is topped by a light brown head.  Aromas of dark fruit, fruit-cake, and rum.  The taste has a lightly spicy yeast character.  There is a light sweetness, though this beer is fairly light bodied.  Flavor notes of raisin and other dark fruit are under the spicy notes of this beer.  The spiciness adds a complexity to this beer that was not in the 6, but I think that the 6 was better integrated than this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2854,"2003-12-13",3.9,"Bottle dated 27-10-04.  Pours cloudy brown with head and no lace (my glass?).  Reminiscent of my wife's rum balls:  chocolate, raisin, cherry, and alcohol in a doughy-malty base. Rum, raisin cherry and dry aftertaste.","Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania, USA","pobenohne"
2854,"2003-12-08",4.3,"A dark cloudy brown with a large lasting off white head. A nice sweet aroma of caramel, licorice, banana, raisin, plum, berries and bread. A medium thick creamy, velvety palate with a decent amount of carbonation and a very nice alcohol warmth. Flavor is complex and filled with raisin, caramel, chocolate, banana, berry, and vanilla with a finish of pepper, grass and a hint of alcohol.  Dry finish. The major differences I found between the 8 and the 10 are: the 10 is darker, the 10 has a slightly thicker body, the 8 has more lively carbonation, the flavor of the 10 is a little sweeter, stronger and slightly more complex. Both are excellent.","Apple Valley, Minnesota, USA","Nexxus"

The aroma is quite malty sweet.  The flavor has roasted malt, candy, some bitterness, chocolate, old ripe cheese (?), and dried fruit - all alternating and rolling in and out like waves.  The palate is quite rich.  Yes, this is a fine Trappist.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
2854,"2003-12-07",4.8,"I love the dark mahogony body that looks like it has about a sunset's variety of colors. Stick tangy aroma that starts light on the cotton candy and heavy on the caramel sauce.  Fresh tilled earth and vinuousness come on as the head collapses. Very warming, which is the only way you would know that it has 11.3%ABV. Flavor is very complex going from tangy to toasty to sweet and back and then forth again.

2854,"2003-12-04",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2004 One fo my all-time favorites that I tend to drink as often as possible since it is quite easy available in Denmark! It pours a foamy tan head on a dark brown body - absolutely beautiful! Aroma and flavor is very complex and delicious. Lots of dark roasted malt and fruit, plums, raisins, berries, spices and a perfect balanced alcohol bite. This is almost as good as it can get! Only Westi 12 is a slight cut above this one, but still, this is a world-class beer!","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"

An intoxicating aroma of fruit (mainly cherries and apples) some pepper and butterscotch as well.  Chocolate, plum, grape and currant were indeed noticed in the flavor.  Alcohol seems to linger alittle on my lips and the tip of my tongue as well!  But all in all this in a great brew, and I wish it wasn't so expensive!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2854,"2003-12-01",5.0,"Available!!  Bottle is dated 26-08-08.  Beer pours (in Chimay glass) a dark brown (with red), somewhat black liquid with a generous amount of off-white head that dissipates a little, and lingers.  Aroma is of sweet fruit with sour apples.  Flavor is... so powerfully complex that my description would mean little.  When I drink this again, I'll try to add more.  Amazingly, no alcohol is detected in the flavor.  Alcohol only noted by a warm belly and sometimes a throat burn.  There is a plum/prune/raisin ending.  Wonderful.  Magnificant.  Better than Chimay Blue.  I am literally saddened to see my bottle go empty.  This beer deserves every score it is given.  Top beer IMHO.  Sampled at 67 degrees Fahrenheit.","Franklin, Pennsylvania, USA","roomtempbeer"

Truly a great beer.  Wheatbread alcohol sweet smell.  Dark brown color on bottom which turns into a light yellow and orange at the top.  Huge tan head with little lacing.

2854,"2003-10-26",4.3,"Mix of rusty orange and darker cherry/brown.  Big head is light beige.  Aroma of yeast, molasses, raisins and of course, alcohol. Tons of sediment. Began super bubbly and quite peppery.  Lots of alcohol, some anise and a green raisin flavor that starts out mildly bitter and astringent.  Wasnt so impressed as it started, but as the beer settled, and it warmed further, the carbonation died off and the body took on a creamier feel.  Now I am seeing why this is so loved by many.  Flavors mix together with wonderful caramel malt, nice brown sugar to mix with the clean hops flavor on the full body.  Vanilla and oak flavors, as well as some herbal appeal.  Extremely complex and the finish dries out a touch, with a big alcohol bite, and a fruity (raisins, plums) flavor.  There is alot of butterscotch on the finish as well.  More balance than Abbaye des rocs, the young not-so-richly sweet fruit flavor is key.  Would like a little less bitter alcohol taste though on the finish.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours the perfect trappist beer color, very dark and opaque though (unlike westy 12). I drank this out of a Chimay glass, is that ok? Flavor has a light alcohol sting in the finish but this isn't too sweet (good thing) and has a subtle hop & malt balance that is uncanny. Finishes a little acidic and with a bit too much alcohol bite. Once again as one of the legendary trappist flagship beers and a RB Top 5, this was phenomenal and was perfect to mimic my pseudo trappist-fasting session.

Alcohol is noticeable, especially after you swallow, not a bad thing in any way. Big chewy body with a very nice lingering finish. Does it get any better than this? Let me taste that Westy 12 and I will let you know.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
2854,"2003-08-14",5.0,"(330 ml bottle). Pours with an enormous and thick light tan head, beer is cloudy,  very dark brown colour. Heavenly complex aroma: oak, port wine, dried fruit and spices. 10 points for aroma is not enough! Flavour is complex, spicy and oaky - toffee sweetness is well balanced with hops. Warming mouthfeel, otherwise the high ABV is well hidden. Long lasting aftertaste. Can't find any faults with the beer - therefore a straight 5.0. Does that imply that any ""perfect"" beer has to be as strong as Rochefort 10? Certainly not - but in the strong division, this one is in the lead, at least untill I have sampled Westvleteren... (But the price in Norway is outrageous: USD 9 for a small bottle - in the store!)","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
2854,"2003-08-09",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2006 November 2, 2006 Bottle dated 220909. Purchased at the NSLC Port of Wines for the princely sum of $2.98!!! Happy Birthday to me! Huge billowy beige head atop a very dark brown body. Aroma is lightly alcoholic, mild malt and burnt caramel/sugar aroma is moderate, and not helped by my (only available) choice of glassware, but still quite pleasant. Rich flavour is quite obviously alcoholic but more from the gravitas and the warming of the throat than any rough alcohol tastes. Spicey light hints of anise, slowly crosses into an inscrutable line of fruit that is not quite raisins or plum. Lingering warmth of anise/spice and mild sugars in the malty aftertaste. Silky palate (4+) would be a 5 for sure if it had not lost so much carbonation to head formation. Lovely way to start an evening - I am off to the brewpub now! Huzzah! 7/5/8+/5/17 - 4.25 <P>

 April 2006 Bottle dated 111108. Probably around a year old or more. Dark brown body with a big fluffy beige head. Boozey aroma, cocoa, muted sweet malt. Sweet malt flavour finishes quite dry, with a warming alcoholic finish and aftertaste. Light burnt sugars below a  light powdery cocoa that is mild and subtle but lingers. Malt is far less present and alcohol more prominent than I remember from previous samples. Light notes of dark fruit. Alcohol tones down as the glass goes on, or perhaps it just numbs your palate a little! Medium bodied palate. Fails to live up to my mental picture of it, but still pleasant. 6+/5/7/4/14  - 4.0<P>

Head is creamy tan and very tight settling down to about a quarter inch and resting there. Aroma is a complex one. Very fruity and raisin like aromas, alcohol also present. A bit earthy as well. A rich strongly flavored beer which is fruity and malty with a good kick. Has a very smooth and delicate mouthfeel with just a bit of a bite to it near the finish. Nice warming effect creeps up on you. An exceptional ale.

2854,"2003-07-27",4.7,"Very distinctive aroma; faint molasses and light hops. A little too faint to score higher. Murky, reddish brown body. Good sized particles are visible and it is highly carbonated. Head is unspectacular. Flavor is very solid and very rich. There is a crispness like champagne, but with more complexity. Flawless flavorwise. Perfect blend of sweetness and alcohol. Vikingbeau wants to call this a session brew. If he can afford the $7 per bottle and can handle 11.3% ABV per pop, then go for it. That's just it with this brew. It is so smooth that you couldn't guess that it is as high in alcohol as it is.

2854,"2003-07-23",4.5,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2007 Bottled on 5/22/02, sampled on 5/4/07: Aroma boasts lots of sweet dark fruity figs and raisins.  Flavor is much the same, but a little drier.  Nicely-balanced and well-aged.

Rerate: Consumed 2/23/04, Bottled on 8/15/01: Pours the same as the previous rating, with added dry Belgian malt in the aroma.  Body still has great dark fruit and caramel malt complexity with a bittersweet, almost chocolatey finish that masks the alcohol very well.  Still a world-class Trappist ale as far as Im concerned.  This gets the same numbers as my first rating.

7/23/03: Oily dark brown with a thick fizzy tan head.  Aroma of fresh baked bread coated with caramel maltiness.  Body is thick, syrupy sweet with small bubbles of carbonation dissolved within.  Good complexity of dark fruits, hazelnuts and Belgian yeast.  Great balance and an onslaught of flavor mask the alcohol wonderfully.  This is my favorite Belgian strong ale thus far.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2854,"2003-07-21",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2004 Thanks to Shaggyme for this one shipped directly from Belgium along with Westy 12.  Very dark with sediment and an excellent head and lacing. Alcohol hidden suprisingly well beneath the complex fruity flavors. I liked this one only slightly better than the Westy, but for the cost of shipping and taste, Trois Pistoles is highly comparable in my opinion.","Morganville, Maryland, USA","Cashazza"
2854,"2003-07-21",3.1,"The size of the head on this beer is amazing.  It takes up 90% of the glass easily.  Very dark red in color with lots of sediment.  Best aroma of any Belgian I've had.  Smell of spring flowers, vanilla, toffee, peaches, berries, alcohol and more.  The dominant taste is alcohol, with some sweetness initially.  Still, the flavor is a big disappointment.  Tastes more like barley wine than any other Belgian I've had.  I'd take a St. Bernardus, an Orval or a Chimay Bleu over this any day.  Maybe I got a bad bottle, but at $10.99 a pop, I don't think I'll be trying this again any time soon.","Auburndale, Massachusetts, USA","andy609"

Bouquet is a chocolate melody, the most cocoa from our 6 ABT lineup, dark chocolate with woody, earthy notes and a sharp pencil shavings aspect. Nice complexity for sure, a deep malty sweetness I described as ""Vanilla straight from the wood"", roasted chocolate cakes notes, controled alcohol (one of the least tasting from our lineup surprisingly), sweet earthy (autumn leaves?) nectar, everything is balanced with a fitting solid body bearing an above average carbonation.

2854,"2003-07-06",3.5,"Pruny brown/purple color. Aroma is very musky with a light tinge of perfume (rose petals)--smells like a men's cologne. I was very excited about this after taking in the appearance and aroma but was very disappointed with the flavor. Maybe I have a dumbed-down palate, but I did not find a great deal of complexity here; certainly not as much as in other Belgians I've tried. The flavor was syrupy and spicy, with a bit of raspberry syrup thrown in, and overbearingly alcoholic. In fact, this beer tastes more alcoholic than any I've ever tried other than the WWS 23%. The mouthfeel was very nice but could not make up for the lack of articulated flavors. It was like being hit by a wall of one flavor, albeit a very nice, rather than having the symphony I've experienced in other Trappist beers. I was hoping to be 5'd, after trying the similarly high-rated (and excellent) Westvletern 12 twice (but not rating it), but I left disappointed. I would not have been disappointed if it weren't for the expectations I've built up. I'll give it another try sometime.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

After countless dodgy bottles (and a few tantalisingly good samples) in Australia, I had a bottle (in Mons) in perfect condition and the beer was magnificent. I didnt take proper notes but really it was just like the 8 only bigger. Bucketloads of that crazy Rochefort yeast character with an equal helping of big, silky malt without ever being cloying. Way better than Westy 12, in my book. Great stuff, just dont make it the last beer of a big night and go straight to bed afterwards!","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

2854,"2003-07-02",4.8,"Rochefort 10 is a big opake dark brown trappist beer with a thick, chocolate cream coloured, and resistant head. It has an aroma rich with esters and sumptous, complex malt notes. First impressions when imbibing this lovely beer is of a sweetish, rich malty brew with complex flavours reminiscent of raisins, plumbs, and sweet dark chocalte. It has a tingelling dryness that seems to be derived as much from the alcohol as the hops, though there are no unpleasant alcohol flavours.  Much of the flavours are similar to the Rochefort 6 and 8, though this beer is richer in complex esters and has a silkier mouthfeel. In fact the beer is wonderfully viscous, rich, smooth and coats the inside of your mouth with flavours that linger for minutes after each sip.  Drinking this wonderful ale inside the Abaye St-Remi, within 20 meters, and in full view of the building where the beer is produced was an absolute treat.  The complex flavours linger forever and a kind of numbness developed in my mouth, most likely because my palate was overwhelmed by the end. Numbness also occurs in one's head, the only indication of this brew's huge alcohol content, since there are no discernable flavours.  Rochefort 10 is truly worthy of it's world rankings.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"

The mouthfeel is almost chewy, and notes of chocolate, raisins, and dark cherries roll together.  Finish just a bit shorter than I expected, as I think the alcohol cuts it off a bit.  As a side note, if I read another person commenting about how ""expensive"" this is at $8 a glass, I might scream.  For $8, a wine drinker is lucky to get a bottle of something ""everyday.""  For the same price, I can enjoy one of the best beers in the world.  So pipe down and fork over the dough to the good monks, they earned it.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Bottle: 25/9/07   Extremely dark color, blackish purple, with a nice head that is laced until gone.  The nose is very fruity, especially the plum.  The alcohol is strong and not very hidden which gives it a more interesting palate.  However, for its ABV it is still incredibly smooth.  It is getting better with every sip.  At first I was a little skeptical, but this is an excellent offering.  Initial plum flavor makes way for flavors I cannot describe. Very good!

B/ Sweetness as from liquorice mixed in a port or dark apéritif wine (maybe a great vintage Pineau des Charentes). Alcoholtouch retronasal is from Armenian brandy. Tartness somewhere.

The lacing was good on all sides of my glass. It had a sweet aroma to it and a cloudy brown body. There was carbonation observed with this brew.

Aroma of filthy alcohol and rotting prunes; taste has caramel all over the place with slaps to the back of the head by some greased up bodybuilder who's taped deep fried mars bars to his palms. It conveys an overall feel of really decadent and fatty candy with sultanas and aero bars jammed in there and juicy patties from cows fed on belgian chocolate and ford pills.

Deeper inhalation yielded raisin, cherry, and alcohol.  Pours dark brown (much like a dark apple cider), with a dense, thick tan head of tiny bubbles.  Upon first sip, I was surprised by the inviting mouthfeel lent to this beer by the tight carbonation.  Flavors include raisins, cherries, toffee, cider, and a hint of chocolate, all balanced against nicely warming alcohol notes.  Hops notes are unsurprisingly light.  Overall, a very well-balanced, sweet, malty palate.  The tart, warming aftertaste says ""go ahead, take another sip,"" and is not cloying or annoying.  Overall mouthfeel is full without feeling viscous.

Aroma is of a freshly cut tree, caramel, and raisins. Appearance is a dark brown with even better lacing on my glass than Westy. Flavor is amazing. DO NOT drink this cold. It was nothing special at all before it warmed, but baby when it warms, BAM! The flavor explodes on you. I swear its two different beers served cold and at the correct temp. Heavy on the chocolate note, apricots, caramel, spiced fruit, and raisins. It has a noticeable alcohol flavor but for a 11.3% ABV beer it is hidden quite well. Palate is rich and chocolatey with an almost smokey earthy feel to it. Its tied with Abbaye De Rocs Grand Cru as my 2nd favorite Belgian.

Pure indulgence by the master brewer in making a ABV brew more atuned with a red wine than beer. Heavy, dark and spicy. It hangs together well, with a less than smooth finish, but is not short on flavour nor on aroma. I'd been waiting a long time to sample this one, and was not disappointed.","AUSTRALIA","brewboy"

2854,"2003-05-01",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2003 Finally able to taste this beer! I hope to make this rating as informative as possible, but this is obviously one of the top beers people are willing to try. I bought and tried the Westy 12 because it was ranked so highly...and I recommend it to everyone I see, it is still the best beer i've ever had. So, with that said, here is the review for the Rochefort Trappistes 10. First things first, the temperature of the beer is 63 degrees Farenheit. Dark black colour with a slight tan head and zillions of small bubbles rising up on the side of the glass...very neat looking. The beer is almost completely opaque and even as you stretch it at the sides, no light shows through. Smells of ripe dark fruits, such as raisins and black currants dominate the aroma. Malt and chocolate also show through in the nose, but very minutely. A very complex smelling beer, which definately leaves your mouth ready to taste the beer. And the taste? Complex at first...but almost exactly the same as the smell. Hints of chocolate and malt undermine the taste, while ripe fruits dominate the flavour of the beer. Plums, Raisins and even cherries are in the taste. A very malty beer with that being a definate character of the overall taste and palate. The aftertaste leaves you wanting to taste it again, to see what other flavours and characters you can find in the beer, and this one always keeps you guessing. A very complex beer, both in the smell and in the taste, but done very well. Some hop character, but definately malt overwhelmed. The alcohol is somewhat noticable, but not in a bad way at all. A great texture in the mouth...very carbonated, yet coats the inside of the mouth and the tongue very well. I poured this very slowly down the sides of the goblet until a major amount of sediment came out, then I stopped the pour with probably only 5 to 10 millilitres of liquid left in the bottle. After a few sips, the sweet characters shine through in the aftertaste: chocolate (the major player), roasted flavours, ripe fruits all team up very well to make it a pleasant aftertaste. Due only to personal preference, I believe that the Westy 12 is more of a 'perfect' beer, but that could be only because I like hoppy, lighter, less-malty beers more, but this is still one of the best beers i've ever had. On a quick side note, the inital flavour I had in my mouth after tasting the first sip reminded me very much of the 'meatyness' of the Sam Adams Triple Bock (which I HATED), but those memories quickly faded with the good characters of this beer. If someone asked me what the best beer i've ever had was, I would still say: Westy 12, but this one ranks very close to that. I bought this bottle at Beers of the World in Rochester, New York and the price was $10 I believe. Definately worth a try, especially if you want to sample some of the best beers in the entire world!!!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
2854,"2003-05-01",4.4,"Nice dark brown liquid with a light foam.  Sweet roasty aroma with some malt hints.  Nice alcohol evident in nose and taste.  Warms.  Good texture.  Good subdued sweetness.  A wonderous beer.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"

The smell of the beer was close to perfection, so many things going on in my nose when I smelled that, next was to have nice mouthful of this, and that was something to remember. I dont know quite to describe it. There was a party of taste in my mouth and everybody was invited!! a bit chocolate taste, hints of fruits and raisins, this is something to have again and again.

Its pours a lovely dark brown color and beautiful looking head, sweet smelling aroma, tastes of plum and raisin and the ABV is excellently masked in this brew.

Overall, a fairly sweet aroma with an undertone of alcohol.  The color is fairly dark brown, like a monk's robe.  The alcohol in the flavor is concealed well.  There seems to be a residule film in my mouth that diminishes quickly.  There is a sweetness in the brew that is just right, not too much or little.  This seems significantly different than the Rochefort 8, a little heavier.  Overall, this ale is great, but still not a Westy 12, in my opinion anyway.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"

Sweet dark sugary notes as well.  The flavor also features an agressive alcohol taste.  Roasty biscuit amd apple peel are also plesant.  Finishes with some chocolate bitterness.  I don't see what the big deal is about this beer - too much alcohol flavor for not much depth of flavor.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
2854,"2003-03-29",4.0,"This beer poured a very dark brown color and formed an light tan bubbly head that left some lace. An aroma of malt, plum, raisins and spice.

Somewhat sticky and a bit thinner on the palate than I had hoped for but soft, smooth carbonation helps to make up for it. Nice candi sugar sweetness. The thing I notice most is the medicinal alcoholic burn on my toung.

The head is light brown and disappears quickly, leaving only a small layer of bubbles up top for the rest of the beer.  The aroma is laced with alcohol and fruit - the alcoholic scent was to be expected with this strong 11.3% ABV.  Initial taste is sweet, with a bit of alcohol, and a very light hint of coffee/toffee.  A luxurious beer, the aftertaste is almost the best part - sweet, a tad bit acidic, but very pleasant overall.  I started drinking it a bit too cold, but as it warmed a bit, the flavors really became apparent and the complexity of this gorgeous brew emerged.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"

2854,"2003-02-19",4.0,"Finally i got to track down this monster last night at Obriens. This one poured out of my bottle and into my glass a cloudy dark brown with a medium brownish head which did not lace. The aroma was an overpowering smell of alcohol with unidentifiable fruits hidden in there as well. The taste is brimming with carbonation, more so than any other belgian i can remember thus far. Heavy fruit emphasis with raisins, plum and cherry coming to mind. Alcohol flavor and burn is also very common in the taste. The drink actually just has this aged taste about it. I found this to almost have a few port wine qualities to it, given the strong plum and raisin qualities which grew as the drink went down and the aftertaste remained given that lively carbonation level. Nice bittering of the palate and good dry ending. It tries to hide the alcohol as best it can, but 11.3% ABV is a tough order to mask, but Rochefort has done a nice job. Very pleasant indeed.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Two yeasts at the front of the mob lifted their hands together. ""Present"", ""And correct!"" they said, one after the other. Yorick continued down the list, ticking off each name as it was called, until he came to: ""Alcohol!"" There was no reply. Yorick raised his big bushy eyebrows and surveyed the nervous little yeasts in front of him. ""Alcohol! I know you're here, I can smell you. Now answer!"" There was a long pause, then something began stirring at the back of the crowd, pushing its way through. The little yeasts shuffled and moved sideways making a huge gap through which lumbered an enourmous, hairy ape of a yeast, muscles bulging, and scars all over it's huge body. ""What?"" he growled as he approached Yorick. ""Just checking that you're here, that's all,"" replied Yorick. The great yeast bent down to stare closely into Yorick's face.

The nose is very sweet and rich with alcohol predominating until the brew is allowed to breathe.  Secondary aromas consist of figs, dates, maple syrup, resin, and pepper.  This brew pours a dark walnut with honey highlights or as my tasting buddy put it murky dogshit brown (he doesn't get out much).  The light brown fizzy head diminishes rapidly with no lacing.  The exceptionally well balanced and deep flavor has a high level of acidity.  The finish is sweet warm and spicy.  The light to medium fizzy dry body finishes dry.

Flavors are very subtle and melded together exceptionally well. Starting off you have the same dark fruit that you had in the nose, followed by a chocolate sweetness, ending with a smooth warm feeling yet leaving the mouth clean and ready for another drink.

Alcohol is definitely felt by glasss end but is nto felt with every sip. This is an amazing brew.
 9/1/2001: Im not sure why I feel the need to apologize, but I will. This beer and its ilk of high alcohol and malty brews have done little for me and Im sorry to do this to a world classic. Yes fruit hues emerge but only as occasional accompaniment to the methodic pounding of candy carmel and alcohol.  I am very disappointed.  The tongue is almost all alcohol, flooding and piquant with bits of fruit emerging in the vacuum of the riptide.  Even its presentation was flawed by a big black sea monkey like a mote on the dying head. I wish I could send Edsten Double-Plus to more people.

Old:  I followed Volgon's recommended serving suggestions to the letter on this one.  Boozy nose.  Flavors of pear, raisins, fruit cake, vanilla and banana, with the yeast providing the most interesting flavors.  Unfortunatly, these flavors could barely manage to peek out under the sheer weight of the alcohol.  Unbalanced and fairly disappointing.

The aroma is heavenly and contains, plums, sweet malts, brown sugar and some dark fruits.  Robustly carbonated with soft bubbles.  Flavor is a delightful sweetness that is beyond good. The year of aging really helps.  No score change from last time. Re-rate 8/14/02:  While still easily one of the greatest beers on the planet, it lost in a head-to-head with Westy 12.

Had a more prevalent head than expected.  Flavor is very rich and strong, though certainly doesnt seem to be an 11.3% brew--the complexity masks the % quite nicely.  Tasty yeasts, giving a pleasing residual sweetness.  Very fruity, lots of ripe plums, vanilla, and port.  Very vinous, reminding me of a number of barleywines (or, again, the other way around).

I get first whiffs of maple syrup, sweaty socks, cinnamon and alcohol. The head pours thick and quickly clears. This is difficult to describe. I keep getting familiar tastes, but the mix is so complex that I cant pin things down quick enough. Spicy, lightly hopped overtones mix with a complicated, yet subtle, chocolate flavor.

After all I had read other peoples rating about how it wasnt that refined and the alcohol was too dominant etc etc. Now let me say: this might very well be my new favouite beer.

Black/Brown/Maroon in clour with lovely white head. Aroma is one of the best Ive encountered. And the flavour! much more toffee-y and malty than what I had been anticipating (I was expecting more plums and raisins). Every tastebud on your tougue is tickled in delight as the liquid slides down your mouth. Alcohol is quite noticeable but I didnt find this to be an overly bad thing.

The flavor... well, the flavor is quite remarkable and complex as hell. It starts off with raisin, hint of banana, spice and plum then turns to a more stoutish chocolate, molasses and coffee... still with the hints of spice and raisin cutting through now and then and maybe even some orange. The finish is wonderfully dry with just a small tease of sweetness that makes you wonder if, in fact, you just tasted what you thought you did. A beer like this makes me happy; im so damn excited to try my westy 12 i have sitting in the cellar now... im such a nerd.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","slinkymello"

Now i know most belgians take on port characteristics with age and its a toss up with each bottle you buy and im going by that. It smelled like bananas and the usual belgium spice, but after giving it time to breathe it was just full on bananas. The taste was port (blagh) and the finish was like sour bananas. Very interesting, and also quite complex..lots of tastes rush in and out.","Florida, USA","TheRimmer"

2854,"2002-08-17",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2004 I finally tried this monumental brew. Even though it cost me $11.00 I am still very impressed. It's not often that I'm drinking a beer alone and say ""Wow!"" after every sip. Very full bodied and yet it is not a struggle to drink. It has a beautiful balance of alcohol and raisins. (Think Raison Detre except much more complex and much much better) By the time it had warmed I felt as though I was drinking some sort of rum raisin drink. A great desert beer and something I look forward to treating myself to after Christmas bonuses.

What a beer. 1st rerate Aug 16 2002: Aroma -1. The aroma is fresh and a tiny bit sour. This was probably a very fresh beer. Date on bottle 7.02.07.

As I said on my previous rate this is a monster beer! It has the bite of a good bitter, the velvety smoothness of top stout, all the aromas of a spice cupboard, and the alcohol content of a red wine. Aroma - this would take all day. Initially I get floral honeysuckle, sweet malt, hops, sultanas more than raisins, then spices and maybe even bubblegum, boiled lollies and rotting wood yeast. The palate is beautifully balanced across sweet and bitter. Body is rich, smooth and full through the bitter/sweet malty vinous middle, finish and aftertaste. The high ABV is dangerously well disguised. Not quite as good as the Westy 12 but  IMHO its equal within the coarseness of the rating scale we use.

2854,"2002-08-10",4.7,"I will compare this beer to Westvleteren 12 because they are similar beers. Rochefort is darker and more opaque. The head is a darker khaki. The head composition is unusual. The bottom is big bubbled but the bubbles get smaller the closer to the top until the top layer you cant see the individual bubbles and you just get a creamy foam. Because of the different bubble sizes you get a less creamy mouthfeel , but one where the feel of the bubbles plays a part. The aroma is that of a good porter with some spice and fruitiness. The flavor has a nice toffee maltiness with pears, chocolate and a dessert spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. It also has a brightness to the flavor that the Westy lacked. Like the Westy, surprisingly easy to drink for its strength.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

The aroma is delectable, foreshadowing the yeasty, spicy flavor of the beer to come.  It makes the whole mouth tingle, if not to the extent of the Westy12.  The alcohol is well-masked, yet not completely, which complements the various fruit influences (raisin was the most identifiable in this most enjoyably complex beer).

The aroma as well as the flavour is rather complex. It has a spicy and rich taste with notes of Danish rye-bread and a fruity sweetness. The high alcohol content is definately not a negative thing.

The aroma is yeasty, malty and mildly sweet, and the alcohol comes right through.

At times, the aroma and taste of assorted fruits and berries did manage to get through their alcoholic mask. But the massive amount of alcohol caused them to taste almost artificial. The color was a rosie(?) brown, and it had a nice bubbly head. The alcohol gave it a very dry, almost red wine aftertaste. This one reminded me more of a stiff rum and coke than a beer.

Also present in the aroma are berries, and what reminded me of cherry flavored Pez.  While studying its appearance, I found its opaque, lavender color to be very intriguing, and creamy light-brown head very inviting. Throughout the glass, I felt like I was being teased--the aroma was so appetizing, but the taste was masked by the alcohol, which thoroughly destroyed my enjoyment of this beer.  Almost indistinguishable because of the alcohol were raspberry and plum flavors. Not quite creamy or smooth, I was disappointed to say the least.
