The beer looks lovely. It is like a stout should look like. The color of the beer is a very dark brown, almost black. It is to dark to check the clarity. On top of the beer there is a nice layer of smooth light brown foam. Lovely.
The smell of the beer is lovely. Its real stout. I smell nice toasted malt aromas. There is coffee, some nice bitter and slightly savoury roast and a nice mild touch of liquorice. There is a tiny hoppy bitterness and fruitiness in there to.
The taste is just as good. Full taste of bitter sweet chocolate, lovely coffee. The malt flavours are amazing. Such clear flavours. Sweets, bitters and slightly savoury notes are in perfect balance. Great.
The palate is a lso lovely. Nice smooth and creamy texture, full body and a lovely long dark chocolate finish. Amazing.","Capelle aan den IJssel, NETHERLANDS","Gangstergafje"

Pointless really. However Ryan bucks the trend (again) for me and produces something both subtle and bold. Its opaque dark brown with a laudable tan head. Aroma not up to all that much: a bit of smoky coffee but nothing earth shattering. Then theres the taste. Simultaneously sweet, sour, bitter and herby. Raw coffee, rice vinegar, coriander, bitter chocolate, a hint of vegetable and soy. Finish is a bitter-sour espresso hit with hints of green banana and blackberry.

489,"2013-04-07",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2015 Cask @ Devonshire Cat, Sheffield [100615]
Pitch black, dense tan creamy head. Nose of smooth roast, some dark chocolate, soft fruity coffee, hint of vanilla. Taste of deep dark rich malts, dark fruits, smooth fruity coffee, mellow roast. Medium to full body, soft sweet, very smooth, silky, rich, no alcohol. Finish of smooth mellow malts. Think this was 6.7%. Really tasty - this is better on cask than keg. Fantastic stout - this is going straight up to 4.1.

Keg @ Hanging Bat, Edinburgh [020413] 7/2/8/4/16 3.7
Jet black, no head, no lacing
Aroma of roasted malts, deep roast, chocolate, dark sweet malts, initial roast aroma disappeared after a while
Taste of roasted malts, dark deep malts, lots of dark quite sweet chocolate, really good flavour
Palate - Very soft carb, medium body, keg carb rather flat but no problem for me, nice smooth dark malts. Finish - rich chocolately malts, really nice long rich linger, you can almost chew the malts in your mouth during the finish, yummy
Overall - Great beer..bit flat from the keg....rather expensive for a 6% beer","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"
