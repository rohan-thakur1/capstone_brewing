4393,"2015-02-06",3.2,"From site: Born of a flood and centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Black Lager uses a lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel

4393,"2014-09-12",3.9,"Transfer from BA review on 5-25-13-
 
 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance- The brew pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights shining throughout. Upon pouring there is a one finger tan head that fades slowly over time to leave persistent foam on the top of the brew.

 Smell- The aroma has a nice roasty malt aroma mixed with notes of an earthy hop. There are nice smells of chocolate and coffee as well as a caramel smell giving it an overall sweet and toasty smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with sweet caramel and some sweeter chocolate flavors. While sweet, there is some more roastier flavors with some bready notes as well. Some nut flavors come to the tongue along with flavors of dark fruit. More toward the end some lightly bitter flavors of coffee and an earthy hop come to the tongue leaving a moderately sweet and smoother roasted more porter like flavor is left on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the thicker and creamier side with a medium to slightly lighter carbonation level. The creamier body and lighter carbonation are great for the sweeter and roasted more porter like flavors of the brew allowing them to fully sink into and be sensed by the tongue.

 Overall  A rather tasty brew. A little on the sweeter porter like side but still quite drinkable and refreshing.","","Darkmagus82"

S: nutty, roasted barley nose. Very slight earthy hop.

T: tastes a hint astringent. Reminds me of a burnt, sour porter.

M: Med body, low carb. Slightly sticky.

D: I have no desire to drink this beer again. I can, however, see why it appeals to a larger micro drinking market. Falls into the dark beer category for many folks.

4393,"2012-10-19",3.5,"Reviewed 8/31. 12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a dark burgundy color that shows traces of carbonation beneath the tint. The one finger offwhite head doesnt retain as well as Id like in a Belgian-style ale, but it leaves a nice ring of lacing.

S: Chocolate, slight roasted malts, pumpernickel bread, and plums. Almost porter-esque in its aroma, and an impressive one at that.

T: Initially, theres a wave of coffee and light ash (not necessarily roast) that envelops the tongue. Whem given time to sit in the mouth, it will finish in a fruity manner, with both dark and lighter fruit esters. Some finishing dry, bittersweet chocolate also appears. Two flaws here; the coffee almost takes on a vegetal tone at times, and its not particularly exploding with flavor.

M: Its hard to describe the general feel. Its smooth in general, but has a yeasty astringency to it on the finish, and is a little too heavy for its mellow flavors. Drinkable enough.

O: While its good, I think its too hard to drink given its mild flavor profile. Its still worth a try and I might even get it again in the future.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

A - Half a finger head that disappears almost instantly colored wood brown. The brew is dark brown only if you show up to a light. It looks black but is clearly just a very dark brown with no sediment.

S - The malts are slightly chocolatey. Im getting some half and half cream and some earthiness. Maybe some light wood scents and some spices but theres not a lot going on for smell.

T - The start of this is a classic Belgian ale. Im geting some candied yams, grapes and the yeast is almost like wild grapes and perhaps some orange creamsicle. Its pretty disappointing.

M - Lots of carbonation explosion that exposes some raisin taste. Theres no linger and no real aftertaste of anything.

This is a pretty nice beer overall.  It has a clean, smooth malty flavor that works really well.  The caramel malts, and the other malty components, combine together to make a quality offering.

The flavor is fairly porter-like but fruitier. The beer features a nice shade of roasty bitterness throughout, the dark fruit is abound and some of that cavendish shows up here in the flavor as well. The hops are largely herbal and largely pushed to the background in favor of malty/yeasty complexities. Speaking of yeast, this beer has a nice banana character to it, not in a sweet or cloying way, its subtle but its quite nice. After a while some cherries and woodiness come to the party.

4393,"2010-12-31",2.9,"On tap at the Alamo Drafthouse Lakecreek in Austin, TX. This is a curious beer from a curious brewery. The brewers are of course famous both for their faithful interpretations of complex Belgian styles and for their rather lowbrow offerings that serve as gateways (or, unfortunately, stopping points) for those just venturing beyond the shores of lake macrobrew. This starts as if it belongs in the former category, with rich roast aromas of chocolate and coffee. Yet the body is thin and the finish simple and unsatisfying. There is no Belgian yeastiness to speak of, and what might have been hopped enough to make a clean, bitter aftertaste - a la an American strong ale - merely passes itself off as clean because it is quick and unmemorable. A curious ale that is better than Fat Tire, but unworthy of the brewers better offerings.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

4393,"2010-12-17",3.0,"This beer, though an ale, tastes like a stout made for people who hate stouts. And what I mean by that is the flavor of the beer is watery, without the gristle that a more formidable mouthfeel would have, and easy to drink for people who generally prefer fizzy fluff like Bud or Fosters. The chocolate undertone is definitely available, though not top drawer, and there is an unusual nutmeg sensibility to the beer that crawls over your taste buds like a furtive iguana on a bed of rocks.

4393,"2010-12-01",3.6,"THOUGHTS: Sort of like a Belgian take on an English mild. Very nice, but I was expecting something more unique, like the first time I had a sour ale or traditional ginger beer. This was more of a combo of other things that Ive tried. It also finishes almost a little too dry.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was nearly black in the glass with red highlights and a large, off-white head that mostly, but slowly diminished and left fair to good lacing. The aroma had moderate to heavy, cereal, oats, roasted and nutty malts, and chocolate milk; lighter chocolate and coffee; light yeast; along with a little soy sauce; licorice, cola and sort of a Capn Crunch thing going on. The initial flavor was sweet and slightly bitter; while the finish was rather sweet, light to moderately bitter and ever so slightly sour with a long duration. There was chocolate milk, cola, very bitter chocolate, very dark chocolate, yeast slight licorice, a little coffee, nuts, roasted malt, chocolate cake, chocolate granola and slight black cherry. The light to medium body was oily and then very dry with lightly fizzy carbonation and a lightly astringent and very dry finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
4393,"2010-11-22",4.6,"Served: Poured from bottle to pint.

Aroma: almost like Mocha coffee, roasted nuts. Almost like a nice artisan bread

Appearance: absolutely beautiful deep pitch back amber color. Nice foam head though it does dissipate fairly quick.  It may not taste to much like an ale but is is definitely black.

Taste: With the aroma and color I expected more chocolate but no what you get is a smooth roast without a hint of bitter. 

Palate: I could drink this all day. medium body, creamy and light on the carbonation. Wonderful aftertaste that will stick without for awhile 

Overall: fantastic beer, it is highly drinkable and should appeal to almost any palate. I have not found many parings it does not work with. Recommended for anyone trying to get off the beaten path and into the real world of beer in all of its glorious verity.","Texas, USA","DANEgerous"

4393,"2010-08-01",3.9,"Brown, mahogany, and a wisp of black sits pretty under a café-late head with the consistency of whipped mousse. She is puffs and sticks in clumps to the sides of my glass while her middle half resembles a round marshmallow puff. A few swirls later and I am reveling in burnt toast, ash, charcoal, sweet mesquite crackling in the fire pit, licorice root, dates, figs, and burnt sugar sweetness. Her nose is light, refreshing, and invigorating; a culmination of all the sights and smells one enjoys while sitting bedazzled before fireplace. My first quaff is sweet, mild, and generous. Ive actually had the 1554 before, but it was at least a couple years ago and no tasting notes were involved. Licorice root extract mingles with liquid smoke and mesquite. Pumpernickel abounds both freshly baked and slightly burnt. My palate dries with ash and an almost rauche-like essence. Far from a one flavor aroma, she winds her way into prunes and dates immersed in home-made fudge as chocolate angel-food cake drifts on by. By no means is 1554 a heavy beer; each quaff is at the most medium-bodied with very little chewiness. Her smoke weaves while pumpernickel bakes, date and prune infused fudge cools, and chocolate cake tempts. Now, if all of that sounds good to you, than what are you waiting for? Get your hands on a New Belgium 1554 Black Ale and enjoy; you cant have mine because I already drank it.

4393,"2010-02-09",3.4,"How on earth New Belgium decided on a light lager yeast for a beer from a recipe from 1554 is beyond me. Louis Pasteur did not discover the mechanism behind fermentation until centuries later. This aside, it is a decent enough beer. Garnet red w/ big head of mixed bubbles which leaves tons of lace. Not quite stout dark but the same kind of deep red color. Nose is dominated by a coffee-like roast character, very smooth and easy on the nose w/ a husky grain overtone in the background. Flavor is very much in the same vein and the mouthfeel is quite light w/ perhaps a bit too much carbonation. Bitterness in the finish is mild and again quite fitting for the coffee-ish character. Probably this recipe could be adjusted to make a great porter or stout but as it is it does reasonably well as a light-bodied dark beer of indeterminate pedigree.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

A lot flavors going on here. Tastes almost like a cross between a Schwarzbier, an English Brown Ale and a Belgian Ale. Roasted malt character (with a hint of coffee) competes with sweet fruit and an earthy yeast character. Overall I like it, but it is a little bit of a mess.

Moderate carbonation, medium body, strange finish. Slightly thin but not as bad as many other New Belgium brews.

Light spicy bitterness with light roasted grain and cocoa+toffee. The beer finishes somewhat dry but with a malt-sweet aftertaste - almost too sweet. A bit plain flavor and overall watered down. Some soft fruit esters and subtle banana emerge as it warms. Mouthfeel is spritzy and surprisingly velvety and full-bodied. Overall, not bad but quite plain and unbalanced on the sweet side.

Crisp carbonation and moderate head. Fruity malts in the nose, with a hint of chocolate and very, very faint dusky smoke in the flavors.

Little white bubbly lacing. Malty aroma, roast nut. Tastes simple of roast malt and cocoa. Just the tiniest start of sourness, but it is gone so quickly it might just be me. Could be some slight dark fruits. A little tobacco in the finish is a little odd, but not off-putting. Found this extreamly drinkable after a nice bike ride. Reminded me of a Schwarzbier.

RE-RATE 4/12/11 Tap at Gman FW. This beer pours a clear, dark ruby red color. Very pretty, almost jewel-like. It also has a huge tan head response which lingers for awhile. Great appearance.

The aroma is faint but its still pretty cold at the moment. What I can detect are dark malts, soft chocolate and clay notes.

Flavor is very much a soft flavor of what I can only describe as chocolate cherry coke. The upfront flavor is certainly of dark malts and light cocoa, but after the swallow and into the finish there is a moment, however brief when you could swear you were drinking cherry coke. Wow thats crazy. Medium body with a slick mouthfeel. Interesting to say the least","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

The taste doesnt venture too far from the aroma and has dark sweet malts as the backbone with hints of smoke, coffee and chocolate on top.  The finish is slightly dry and toasted.

4393,"2008-10-31",3.5,"In short: An smooth easy drinking fruity and herbal dark ale of some kind.  Good stuff.
How: Bottle 12oz, age unknown but drank before best-before date.  Graciously sent to me by Hellbilly, thanks a lot Joshua
The look: Very dark ruby body topped by a small long-lasting beige head
In long: Nose of molasses, toffee and herbs.  Taste is soft molasses, soft toffee along, juicy dark fruits and herbal flavours of green stuff family (green tea, laurels, thyme, fine herbs, that type of stuff..).  No bitterness to speak of but the herbal flavours provide some kind of offset (that I wouldnt call balance) to the soft sweetness flavours.  Body is light and soft, carbonation is very smooth.  Not a very tasty beer but every flavour finds its little spot and the end-result is a highly drinkable beer, and I wanted more after my bottle.  Blind test I would have called Dunkel Bock or something like that.  Inspired by a Belgian beer drank some 500 years ago, back when each beer you drank made women look 5 pounds heavier, the exact opposite of today.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The flavor features sweetish malt, oatmeal, and mild cherry-raisin. A bittersweet caress, refreshing tartness, and understated impressions of dates and milk chocolate in the finish flow into a cool brewers’ licorice aftertaste. Just maybe a suggestion of rubbery funk? Light and supercreamy palate, with nitro-widget smoothness... carbonation is gentle and extremely fine.

There is the funky yeast undertone that Fat Tire has as well, somewhat of a sour note to it.  As a traditional ale, you can expect some different flavors in this one that might not keep a brewery in business these days, so I can appreciate it from that direction, but the beer itself leaves a bit to be desired.

Lots of toasted nuts, appropriate malty flavor. . .the finish brings out more notes like tobacco and wood. Theres a thin leathery flavor that I associate with similar ales present, but its not very strong. The beer is relatively light on the palate, considering the style. Its okay, but probably not something Ill get again.

Bomber. I was initially excited to see this at the local grocery store. I remember it being enjoyable enough and a departure from anything else in the pitiful selection there. Give this a pour to reveal a brown beer with a small head. The aroma is musty and slightly gummy with hints at chocolate, nuts, and leather. Perhaps too sweet. I was kind of let down after tasting it. I mean, it’s not bad, but the leathery notes I remember are quite faint. I definitely picked up qualities I associate with generic lagers. This suggests bread, caramel, and creamed corn.  Really nothing special.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

4393,"2007-07-07",3.8,"22 oz. bottle, called New Belgium 1554 Enlightened Black Ale. Roasted malts dominate the aroma, which features chocolate, mocha, and caramel scents and a touch of coffee sharpness. The aroma is not very complex, but its nice. Pours an amber-tinted dark brown color with a copper hue at the bottom of the glass. Produces a large amount of tan head and good, spider-web-like lacing. Pleasant, milky, creamy taste. Milk chocolate, coffee-flavored ice cream, cream soda, and shortbread cookie flavors. Light to medium body. Soft, smooth, and, especially, creamy in the palate. Produces a liveliness on the tongue nonetheless. Essentially an American version of a Continental European version of an English sweet stout / brown ale cross that tastes like a beer-flavored milkshake. It would make a fine dessert beer, despite its relatively low alcohol content. 1554 is a different kind of ale but a good one, and it stands as a pleasant surprise.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

I tend to get a bit of metal in the finish on this one as well, even at temperature. The flavor is molasses, dark coffee and a dry, roasted, bitter finish that lingers a bit. A lot of my friends and fellow RateBeerians hold this beer in relatively high regard. While I am a fan of NB, Im just not feeling it with this one.

There is just a touch of bitterness, and I actually wouldnt mind a bit more, which is something Ive never said about a dark beer before.

I poured this ale into a standard pint glass, producing a larg frothy head, which required me to complete the pour in a few stages.  The head was beige, with good lacing and lasted throughout the experience.  The body of the ale was clear with a dark brown color, with red highlights.

1554 had a light dark chocolate aroma that intensified as the ale warmed to room temperature.  The dark chocolate aroma is currently lingering in my moustache and is very plesant (yet another reason for facial hair!)

This ale was an easy drinking mixture, with very light acidity in its initial tasting and a short bitter finish.  The ale was full bodied, with a creamy texture and soft carbonation, with a slight metallic aftertaste on the sides of the tongue.

4393,"2007-01-03",3.8,"This is one of my top beers. When I first had it, I drank it while eating a nice steak. To this day, I believe that the best way to experience 1554 is with a steak. It has this almost cinnamon quality to it that makes the drinker hunger for more. 1554 is definitely a beer to be respected and could definitely give you a run for your money if you drank the entire 6 pack in one sitting. This beer, as shown by the 86th percentile rating, is a beer that diserves consideration and is not something that should be seen as something merely to get you drunk. Awesome.","USA","zachh"

This is a rich, dark ale that jumps out with flavor but is surprisingly subtle after youve had more than one.  Roasted malt and a hint of molasses and coffee, a slight caramel sweetness, faint chocolate and maybe even toffee notes.  This is a complex, wonderful beer from a great American micro.  I live in Fort Collins so I go there all the time for free samples and they have several exceptional brews and this is one of their best.

The flavor was similar but with a sweetness that was again oaky. I dont know, something about this bottle makes me feel like it has been around for that many years. Definitely comes across as a belgian schwarzbier, a combo that Im not sure is a good thing.","","User37895"

4393,"2006-05-22",3.0,"While dining at The Fish Market in San Jose with my best buddy, I found this one on the menu and rather suprised it was on tap, I ordered it. The aroma was hardly detectable at first, but after about 30 minutes of warming up it finally release some roasted malt notes but that was really about it. Appearance was a very nice dark color with highlights of brown around the outer parts. It looked close to a Kostritzer, but not quite. Mouthfeel was lively with a good amount of carbonation, but not harsh. Flavor was fairly simple, not complex at all. Roasted malt sweetness, slightly (and I do mean slightly) hoppy and some toffee in there. Overall, Id say not a poor choice I made (especially given what my choices were) but Id say that I wouldnt go out of my way to get this.

Tasty approach rolls out semi-bittersweet chocolate, which then teams with uppity effervescence.  Cool mocha coolers emulate mild coffee bitterness and milk chocolatey traits (along with a lactic overturn as well.)  Slightly burnt Tollhouse morsels hug the tongue on the backend.

4393,"2006-05-03",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2006 This one was difficult to rate against others because it has a style all its own.  First, the pour is a deep garnet with clarity when held up to the light.  Head is average sized and fairly pillowy that sticks around for some time.  Dark chocolate nose to match the ""zesty"" citrusy smell along with a nutty character and slight wood-like smell; very interesting.  Amazingly, the flavor is much like the nose with all of the same flavors and a Belgian-like character.  Finishes with a dry, chocolatey, acidity that is actually rather pleasant and intriguing.  Palate is lively and satiny with a medium-thin body.  Truly unlike any beers Ive had, kind of like a mix between a dark brown ale, a bock, and a belgian pale.  Very mysterious but still making it all work in a captivating, and mildly complex beer.  Some extra points for the creativeness.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Pours a very dark cola brown with a small and quickly dissapating head.

The aroma is dominated by the fresh-baking bread yeasts, with some pumpernickel rye, vinegar, and green apple and a hint of lightly-toasted almonds. The flavor is pleasingly balanced and intriguingly different, acidic with distinct but not overpowering dark-roasted coffee malts, tones of warm nuts and wood. Theres not much sweetness here, with a pleasing dry smoke-toned finish. 

Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but refreshing; this is not a heavy beer at all despite its dark color. 
Overall, Im quite favorably impressed, much more than I expected to be.

4393,"2006-01-02",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2007 As an ill trained amateur historian, I would love to know why New Belgium chose 1554 to title their darker, heartier and more savory beer.  The Ft. Collins emblem of consumer quality, well-styled beers looks to have taken a darker bent on brewing, and if they were trying to make an affordable beer thats easy to drink they succeeded.  The upstanding posture of the 1554 is simple, dark and thick.  It envelopes a similarly simple smell of smoke that portends the masculinity of the taste.  By the flavor Id say 1554 is a collection of low and bass flavors that belong at the bottom of any good stout.  Imagine a blend of maple syrup, steak sauce, hickory smoke and brown sugar with a good, solid texture raveled around it.  My only complaint is that the 1554, while a good beer, has to butt heads with many more well crafted and complex dark beers for my precious shelf space.  Maybe its only my loyalty to New Belgium, or my insatiable curiosity about the name that compels me to pick up a bottle when I can, but whatever the cause Im always happy to have it in hand.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The finish is semi-sweet and smooth, not too dry. This is very nice, easy drinking beer that is not too filling and has plenty of flavors to offer.","Henderson, Nevada, USA","JohnnyFlake"

Melt-in-your-mouth smoothness and blend of the flavors, so theres not one dominant highnote -- just a kind of smooth harmony of rich dark tastes.
Very smooth and drinkable for a Belgian Dark Ale, and oh, so available here in Colorado. If you havent had some, pick up a case next time youre through the prettiest state in the USA, which happens to have a lot of really great beers.

4393,"2004-12-19",4.0,"Black ale? A new appellation for me, but after tasting, its more accurately a brown ale painted up in blackface, ...not that theres anything wrong with that.

Dark brown in color, more reddish when seen through light. A full, frothy, creamy off-white head towers on top. Powerful aromatics waft out, fruity and floral, soft, sweet notes of toffee, cream, and nuts. Bold brace of hops jump on board the palate and carry through the finish. Excellent texture, chewy and substantial. Hops start to bow out, as they are muted by the full feeling of the powerful malt presence. Very satisfying, and a superior choice for a session ale. I have to wonder if they didnt blacken this brew, which otherwise tastes like an excellent example of brown ale, to avoid comparison to the inferior Newcastle","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

4393,"2004-03-29",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2009 11/25/2009
Bottle expires 11/2009.  Mahogany body, crystal clear, topped with a medium-small tan head, creamy, quickly shrinking to a thin ring.  Rings and splotches of lace.  Roasty aroma of spent coffee grounds, scorched bean soup, molasses, and thats about it.  Mouth is medium with light, creamy carbonation and a wet finish (eventually dries out).  Flavor is kind of bland.  Heavily biased towards roasted malts including stale coffee, roasted grain, caramel, semi-hoppy finish with wood tones, the white of a grapefruit rind, plastic, and almost smoky notes.  Good looking beer, smells pretty good, totally sessionable.

Bottled.  Pours a clear, dark reddish brown.  Color in the glass is a very nice mahogany color.  Good sized head off-white, rocky, great lacing.  Nice medium body(slightly watery finish), fizzy, creamy carbonation that lasts after you swallow.  Odor is yeasty like a homebrew and rising dough(very strong and sour), alcohol in the odor and very bitter bakery yeast smell(some sweat).  Smells similar to something gone bad, that you wouldnt eat.  Touch of coffee and some caramel sweet.  The odor is ""interesting.""  Flavor improves as it warms.  Its very bitter and sour and harsh fresh from the fridge with noticable acloholic flavor.  Once warmed up it has a light flavor thats rather ""there"" up front and the middle has some sour and sweet from caramel, kind of toffee.  Aftertaste is a coffee-toffee kind of blend and sticks to your mouth.  Overall: I actually dislike this beer; it leaves a nice coating on my mouth, but I dont like the flavor or the smell.  Looks great...smells intriguing...flavor is not for me.

Taste is favorably mild with a great dryish mixture of black malts and chocolate with just a hint of dried floral spices and yeast. Just barely sweet within and has a bit of roastyness to it but its very tame, leaving a nice rounded character to flourish in texture and body, which is medium to full and the smooth carbonation helps this slide right down with amazing ease.

Not much in the aroma department, pretty mellow despite the big head--some malts, typical New Belgium musk.  The flavors are unexciting, but good.  I found prune, raisin, and fig along with a lot of sweetness, bitter like molasses.  Like other black beers, this one tastes and looks thick and sticky, but it is rather light and zingy.

Sweet base accented by very aromatic roasted malts. Hops were mild, but zingy and a little grassy; just a mild bitterness. Slight nip of sour/tart to even things out. Notes of raisins, chocolate and dark toast. Finish is roasty, toasty and slightly burnt. Aftertaste is rewarding and long-lasting. Not as sweet as a porter; not as full-bodied as a stout; and much more flavorful than a dunkel. Really good beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

I was expecting more of the sweet porter style flavors, but instead was greeted with a lighter-bodied smooth chocolatey flavor with slight hints of coffee and spice.  Very delicious and surprisingly easy to drink considering its dark color.  A very interesting and different brew.","Austin, Texas, USA","Heat99"
4393,"2001-12-08",3.1,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2005 Bready/toasty malt with faint texture and taste of raisins and a bit chewy with a long finish as beer is cold, when it warms it becomes creamy, fruity and acidic.  An original example of an unheard of style.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4393,"2001-11-08",4.0,"Kudos to the New Belgium people for their history lesson.  I find this rather inconsistant, even bottle to bottle in a 6 pack.  At its best it is light in body with estery belgian notes as well as light toasted notes. At its worst, it tastes like very roasted barley with no body behind it.  Ill rate it at its best, though.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
4393,"2001-11-03",4.3,"Initial taste is very malty.  Definitely uses dark malts, like chocolate and a bit of roasted barley.  Aftertaste has just a hint of hops indicating a light hop profile.
Overall impression: very smooth and drinkable.  Sweet, definitely not bitter.  A nice warm-me-up for cold winter nights while still leaving your mouth as pleasant as it entered.","Laramie, Wyoming, USA","Dragon99"
4393,"2001-10-28",4.6,"Very nice...Its fruity and sweet but a beautiful body.  New Belgium hits a homer again.","USA","mattcolo99"
4393,"2001-10-19",2.9,"Black ale, huh? I suppose that is closest to a porter or an old ale, cause the black or Schwarzbiers of Germany are lagers. I guess I found it hard to rate, and would have rated it higher if not for the unfortunate skunked aroma wafting in the background. A shame.","LaVista, Nebraska, USA","K-V-F-L"

4393,"2001-08-14",3.4,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2003 note of licorice and dried dark fruits in its spritzy body, finishing dry with some malty notes not unlike raisin toast.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4393,"2001-08-14",4.1,"I liked this beer better after it warmed up a little, probably 50-60 degrees (F).","Sarcoxie, Missouri, USA","bigred7"
4393,"2001-08-07",4.0,"Interesting and nearly unique beer.  I say nearly because this is quite like a robust porter in many ways.  Truly - drink it at 60 deg F or above to get the best depth of malt complexity.  Not as spicy or funky as I expected from a Belgian style ale - I was expecting a porter with funky Belgian yeast - not so.  Color is a very dark red, bordering on black but not opaque.  I enjoyed the chocolatey overtones.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
4393,"2001-04-12",3.4,"Slightly acidic with some spicy flavors too.","Plano, Texas, USA","drs"
4393,"2001-03-29",4.3,"Not really a black, color is more brown but that does not take away from the quality here.  This is a fine ale and I would buy this again as I would the other New Belgium brews that I have tried.","Texas, USA","HuskYou"
4393,"2001-01-11",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2003 I've purchased this beer numerous times on tap and in the bottle.  Everyone I know likes it.  Pleasant, mellow malty profile, toffeeish, lightly roasty and sweet, with hints of molasses and bread, but with a very drinkable consistency.  Needs to be a little warmer than most people realize for maximum flavor, though.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
4393,"2001-01-05",3.7,"A Belgian style black ale.  This beer is not quite black in color, and not heavy bodied.  Sweet and mild with a distinct Belgian yeast flavour.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
4393,"2000-05-09",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2005 Re-Rate, on tap at the brewery:  Beer pours dark brown mahogeny color with a well retained beige colored head.  Aroma is pretty strong sweet malt with lots of roastiness and a bit of chocolate.  Flavor is quite roasty.  Finish is a touch dry with a hint of hops.  Nice beer.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
