3958,"2014-07-06",2.9,"At Yama with Taylor, Stephen, and Dina. Pours cloudy semen white. Aroma is sweet cinnamon toast, alcohol. Taste is sweet tangerine syrup, piña colada. Not very great, the perfumy sweet syrup is too much.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Experiment_Ale"
3958,"2014-07-06",3.1,"Pour from bottle at Yama. Pour is milky white with some small floaters - good legs. Huge coconuts, somewhat citrusy, Malibu, somewhat floral, and doughy aroma. Taste is fresh squeezed coconut milk, lemons, light alcohol, a touch of bananas, and apples with light heat on the backend. Medium body with no carbonation. Crushable piña colada drank.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3958,"2013-12-24",4.0,"Completely delicious. Milky white, opaque, obvious particulate, much more coconut than lemongrass in the aroma, touch of vanilla, lots of almond. Milky on the tongue, thick, bits of alcohol heat and pepper. Sweet. Tastes like a holiday mixed drink. Finishes sweet. While dubious of a concoction made without natural ingredients, this sake company pulls it off. This just plain works.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
3958,"2012-03-01",3.0,"Moderate coconut aroma. Milky white color. Strong coconut flavor similar to a pina colada.","Waterbury, Connecticut, USA","rocbyter"
3958,"2012-01-22",1.9,"Bottle (shaken, not stirred). No head (still). Body is opaque white. Aroma is strong notes of coconut and rice milk, lesser notes of Kaffir lime, glue, lemongrass, alcohol. Flavor is insanely sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is harshly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, oily/gritty texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic.  Wow.  Even though I dont rate ""Taste"" the way most people do (effectively a duplication of the aromatic descriptors) its still pretty rare that the flavor balance and magnitude score varies more than 2 points from the aroma score.  This is about as wide a discrepancy as Ive had.  It smells nice...like real, raw coconut / coconut milk, so even though its overpowering at least it smells natural.  Then you put it in your mouth.  And gag from the ungodly sweetness.  Off the fucking chart.  Cant even describe it.  Piercing, sharp, lactose, artificial, and as intense as a paper wasp sting on your eyeball.  It makes my whole body literally convulse with displeasure.  Its even worse than taking a mouthful of Karo syrup, if that is imaginable.  Which is really sad, because it smells like it would at least be pleasant.  Truly wretched.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3958,"2011-12-29",1.7,"750mL Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Sarah. Hmm, I must say that infused sake should probably join fruit-infused cider in the ""non-beer"" category. This does in fact taste like an adult Coconut life saver. Sweet. Very sweet. Boozy. The perfect pairing for ""second Christmas"" with the in-laws. Or, maybe not.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3958,"2011-06-29",2.7,"bottle thanks to mora2000.  poured yellow with white.  nose is pina colada, flavor is pina colada and alcohol.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
3958,"2011-04-24",2.9,"(750ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) cloudy greenish, chunky and no coating of the glass. Nose of coconut, lemongrass, herbal and cinnamon. Taste of alcohol, lemongrass, cinnamon, gingerbread. Medium thick body.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3958,"2011-01-06",2.1,"(750ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours an opaque cloudy pale yellow body.  Aroma of pina colada and insect repellant.  Flavor of coconut, lemon, nuts, insecticide, and anise.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3958,"2011-01-04",2.9,"Bottle courtesy mora2000. Pours a dirty cloudy yellow white color with chunks of things floating in it. Aroma is fairly coconutty. Grassy notes with lemon and Christmas tree. Flavor is sweet and uber-spicy. Lots of decorative soap and coconut shavings. Very candle like. Odd to say the least.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"
3958,"2011-01-03",3.1,"Cloudy milky color. The aroma is coconut and some lemongrass. The flavor is very heavy on the coconut with some cream and vanilla notes. The sake tastes a lot like a pina colada. There is also quite a bit of alcohol in the flavor and aroma. Gritty, sandy texture.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3958,"2009-06-10",2.4,"Bottle: Pours a milky color with a bit of particles but not overly huge. The nose is strong with alcohol and coconut with a tangy note that could be perceived as lemongrass or acidity. The flavor is sweet and fruity with lots of coconut, which the nigori probably adds a fair amount of I assume. The finish is acidic and lingering. Too sweet for me but I can see blending this on ice for a little pseudo-sake pina colada might be fun.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3958,"2008-03-25",2.7,"The aroma has a strong coconut presence with rice and alcohol. The appearance is cream colored with a white haze. The flavor is like the aroma with cinnamon and astringent tastes. The palate is oily. Overall its interesting.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3958,"2008-03-25",3.0,"There is defenitly a coconut presence and it is overpowering, its feels more like a rum that a sake. IT tastes a tad medicinal yet after you get a couple of sips you get some pleasant surprise.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3958,"2008-03-06",3.2,"Thank you ilovedarkbeer for this pina colada, I mean sake. Aroma is that tropical drink we all know. No head, but waves and chunky legs. Small particles floating. Some alcohol on the taste but a lot of coconut. Chucky mouthfeel but nice.  Not a great sake but quite drinkable!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3958,"2008-03-05",2.6,"Well, this gets me a new sake style...  but it wasnt very good.  I was hoping itd be like so many Thai coconut drinks that are available.  But it wasnt anything like that!  The sake pours to a super murky coconut milk looking body with small particulate.  The aroma is heavily coconut milk with notes of lemongrass.  Polished rice.  The flavor is actually not that bad with super sweet coconut milk, cinnamon, lemongrass, and Cinnabon cinnamon rolls on the finish.  The palate is sweet, surprisingly warming but not sharp for 18%.  Sticky.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
3958,"2008-03-02",2.2,"I am going to call this, ""I cant believe its not tanning lotion."" Pours a cloudy white color with a bit of a yellow tint. Nose is pure pina colada and lemons. Taste is acidic, sweet, and there is some bubblegum. Hot mess is what I say. No thanks tastes terrible.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
3958,"2008-02-29",2.3,"Thanks (sorta) to Blake for bringing the bottle.  Poured thick milky white with some sticky, chunky legs running down the sides.  The aroma was very much pina colada, with a bit of wheat and coconut milk.  The flavor had lots of coconut with sharper lemongrass on the back-end.. husky and warm on the back-end, and nothing that I want to taste again.  Milky and a little chunky on the palate, leaving a gross sticky feel behind.. the only plus is that it masked the alcohol a bit.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
