Le gant est relevé : je pense à la plage, au soleil et à rien dautre quà me relaxer bien paisiblement. Liquide doré à peine voilé. Les bulles émanent du fond de ma coupe avec énergie. La mousse tient parfaitement sur mon verre en des dentelles aussi complexes quélégantes. Nez de foudre où je crois déceler des notes de vin blanc ainsi que du bois, un funk de brettanomices très énergique et des bonbons sûrs à la pêche. Bien crisp et sèche, je sens tout de même un mouthfeel un peu beurré de Chardonnay qui apporte non seulement rondeur mais également longueur et profondeur. Acidité bien modérée, cest le côté barriqué qui lemporte. Très effervescente, chênue et veineuse, cette bière me plaît énormément.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

>> Rating #8000 thanks to Mike for this generous bonus in our latest trade. Celebrating not only 8,000 ratings but also surviving a wildfire and buying my first home. Pours highly carbonated, small bubbles. Large soapy white head emerges, Brett driven, with okay retention and beautiful lacing. Color is low haze, perhaps chill hazed, straw white gold. Nose is delicate and beautiful- fresh oranges, ocean, pineapple sherbet. As it warms, it really explodes with even better tangelo, white grapefruit rind, sea spray, papaya, excellent Brett C. Taste is highly effervescent up front moving to something like a thicker Belgian witbier with orange zest, orange creamsickle, dough, mild maltiness makes this not your typical ""drained"" Brett saison that leaves the mouthfeel with nothing but bubbles and the palate overly dry with concrete. Perhaps this one is mixed fermentation or SARA has another trick up their sleeve. This isnt sour at all like Saison Bernice and comes across more like SARAs take on a witbier. Still, it is a more malty saison with even hints of white sugar. I think that makes it balanced amongst other Brett saisons out there. Impressive. Palate is buoyant and bright, lightly tangy and fresh, no sourness/saltiness, and mild sweet roll and sugar make it clear this is not a sour/wild. Quenching and perfectly successful for what the beer describes on the label. Typically, this isnt what I would rate a 4.4, but that is how the numbers come together. I dont like pulling the trigger on anything above 4.3; but I should stop being a prude and just do it. Another way of looking at it is, for the saison style, what more can you ask for?","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Just beautiful, with great balance throughout, nice lemon and tangerine, mellow citrusy tang. Light bodied with fine, massaging carbonation. Finishes with essentially perfect balance, mild sweetness, restrained funk, slight lemon peel and further moderate citrus tang. Gorgeous.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

3840,"2014-04-01",4.0,"Bottle shared at Dunts Tasting (Chicago, IL). Pours a nice well hazed golden hue, decent haziness with big frothy whitish head atop. Sticks around, laces well. Aromas are potent lactic acidity, lemon meets bread, straw, touch of guava. Initial is tart, dry, small. Firmly sour, a bit bready with gentle fruit, firm yogurt, straw and gentle yeastiness. Middle takes on a bit more yeasty elements, firm dry straw, some gentle lotion and yeast. Backend is a bit dry, tart, some lingering fruity ester elements. Fantastically crafted as it comes together. Tart and funky, dry and small. Nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3840,"2014-03-14",4.0,"Bottle, thanks to ineedbeer, 03/14/2014. Pours pale golden straw, hazy, fluffy white head fades to fizzy pillow on the surface. Aroma is cloud of light cereal grains with dusty yeast, subtle white grapes and pear, understated juicy tropical notes, light lemon and hay. Taste is spritzy citrus, fruity tropical notes before drying out quickly to mild grassy bitterness, brett, lingering cereal grains and subtle funk. Light, round body, crisp. Delicate, complex, excellent saison.","New York, USA","jbeatty"

Flavour is complex, juicy and refreshing, with loads of juicy farmhouse notes, complex as hell brett, and a little funk. Extremely elegant and flavourful despite only being just over 5%.

3840,"2013-12-17",3.8,"Delicate brett aroma, beautifully hazy straw color. Aroma of a typically bretty saison, yet the refinement is obvious. Crisp, clean, and impeccably balanced. Like Saison-Brett but a noticeable step up.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3840,"2013-11-30",3.8,"750 ml. bottle. It pours a nice effervescent golden yellow with a pillowy white head. The aroma is very pleasant with strong grainy pilsner maltiness, light notes of soap, pear, spice and wheat. Fresh bread. The flavor is more brett forward with strong funk, wet hay, saltine crackers, very light orange and wheat. Spicy, bretty finish with very subdued phenolics and floral noble hops. Super dry with a frothy yet creamy body. Very nice and balanced.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

3840,"2013-11-13",3.7,"On draft at Sante - reviewed from notes. Aroma is estery, with some pepper, yeast, brett-like must, damp towel, soaked grain, banana and
pear. Not as funky as Tims other brett beers, but overall a nice clean belgian aroma. Pours unfiltered golden with big soapy head that dissipates to a thin film leaving webby lacing. Taste is thirst quenching with very nice fruity brett flavor that steers away from the earthy notes. There is a moderate amount of yeasty bread notes and spice in the back end. Nice body and dry finish. Word on the street is that Lucybelle went into wine barrels with grapes. Interested to see the house bugs work on this beer.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3840,"2013-11-04",3.6,"Tap. Pours cloudy golden with a small white head and nice lacing. Aroma is spicy, orange peel, dish towel, faint Brett notes as well. Flavor is lightly sweet and fruity, apple. Bretty funk present but not strong. Quite dry in the mouth. Light body, refreshing and crisp on the palate.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3840,"2013-10-12",4.0,"A - pours light glowing golden sunshine, with almost no white head. S - this is a bretty beer! Bretts, light sulfur egg funk, yeast, and straw. M - light medium body, low carb. Full palate brew with a dry end. T - nice bretty saison. Light eggy funk, grasses and subtle nonsweet pineapple. O - a nice funky saison, away from the typical spiced or belgiany saison. 4","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3840,"2013-10-12",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Pours cloudy light gold with a filmy white head. Spicy brett phenol aroma, without delving into plasticky, fresh grains and light banana fruitiness. Flavor is similar with big bretty funknotes fluttering about. A whisper of peach creeps in among the banana esters. Pretty nice brett showcase, and Im terribly interested in how this evolves. Very dry finish.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
