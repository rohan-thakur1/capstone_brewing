123,"2015-06-19",4.0,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml). 2010 harvest. From SlovakSniper, thanks!

Appearance: Clear bright orangey-copper with nice alcohol legs. 

Aroma: More caramel than apples forward, but theres still some caramelized apples of course as well as mild spiciness (cinnamon mostly), hints of vanilla and floral notes. 

Taste: Medium to heavy sweetness with loads of caramel and caramelized apples, moderate acidity, mild spiciness, vanilla notes, a bit of alcohol and honeyed notes.

Palate: Medium to full body. Oily and syrupy mouthfeel. Warming finish with mild spiciness. Mouth coating caramelized apples. 

Overall: Extremely well balanced ice cider with a unique profile. Nice mix between caramel (not brown sugar like many ice ciders) and other components. Very tasty stuff.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
123,"2015-06-18",4.1,"Vintage 2010. La robe est celle dun cognac ou dune eau-de-vie similaire. Le nez est riche en caramel, en miel, en poire fraîche, en pomme compotées et en fleurs acidulées. Le goût étonne avec cet équilibre entre les sucres et lacidité. Cest franchement très bon. La belle texture soyeuse va de pair avec son corps assez fort. Sa finale est profonde, mielleuse avec une touche dérable et remplie par les fruits. Complexe. Excellent.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
123,"2015-06-12",4.1,"2010 vintage. 375mL bottle, pours a pretty clear brandy-like caramel colour. Nose is luxurious, with loads of caramel apple sweetness, pineapple and a subtle tartness underneath. Flavour is similar, with caramelized apple and pineapple sweetness (unusual that this is so pineapple-y), with medium-high sweetness for an ice cider, and absolutely no tartness. Really viscous palate, with a lovely mix of fruits that is unusual for an ice cider. Very decadent stuff. Fantastic, unique one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

123,"2008-05-28",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2015 2015-05-30. Golden amber body with a syrupy body. Aroma is quite sweet and fruity, notes of apples, sugar. Flavour is similar, sweetly sugary, fruity apple character and notes of skins. Bit too sweet overall, it has lower acidity than some other ice ciders which leaves it less balanced. Smooth full bodied syrupy palate, no carbonation. 4+ Enjoyable. 7-8/4/7-8/4/15-16

2005-05-24. Rich golden caramel coloured body with a thick syrupy body that coats the glass. (3+) Sweet buttery butterscotch notes in the aroma, fairly alcoholic overtones, surprisingly not a lot of apple actually. Flavour is similarly sweet, caramel like sugars, sugary apples, very light tart apple in the background, bitter apple skins, dry alcohol and apple skins in the finish. Syrupy full bodied palate.

123,"2008-05-27",4.0,"Bottle (500ml corked & clear).  At 2nd Annual Summer Saison Tasting - my  bottle via trade with Matt7215.  Amber-tinged gold pour, slick and oily-looking, solid legs.  Moderately boozy aroma (but NOT 22%!), rich blend of buttery malt and overripe apple, hint of white wine.  the taste initially has very strong alcohol (more than one ""whoooooooooooo!:"" was heard) but it settles down to a sweet, strong experience rather like a carnival candy apple liqueur.  Thick, alcoholic, slightly burnt taste, the apple really comes out in the finish - well done - quite a different take on the Québec-style ice ciders, but really good.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
