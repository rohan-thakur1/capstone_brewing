4090,"2015-12-06",4.1,"0.25L on tap at Druggist Singapore. 
Appearance: Pours a nice peach golden with little head that quickly fades, color resembles that of a Weizen. Slightly cloudy with lacing of carbonation and yeast. 

Aroma: Initial whiff is that of fresh fruitiness from green apples, followed by a slight moldy and earthy smell resembling cheese. Definitely a unique and unusual aroma since its my first lambic. 

Taste: Initial sip is smooth tartness that fades into a mild salty aftertaste. Light mouth-feel with watery texture and mild carbonation. With more sips, it develops into a fresh and pleasant sour green apples taste reminiscent of a dry cider. Alcohol is never overpowering and well hidden by the tartness and fruitiness and only traceable in the last few sips. Has a distinct earthy farmhouse taste and not your usual beer.

Finish: Pleasant and refreshing finish of floral honey. 

Overall: A very refreshing drink in the tropics that must be slowly savored (Please dont chug this beer) since it takes time to develop and release its full aromas. It started off fresh, tart while kinda bland but slowly progress into a nice balance of apple fruitiness and tartness with light honey accents.","SINGAPORE","PoPzHa"

Tapped out a rich amber. 16ºSRM.

Nose from far away has the sweet tang of fermentation, not rot, but that enticingly pleasant aroma that you get around slowly aging cheese and hams or closer to the cool organic sweetness of dry aging beef. Just so very nice. Closer inspection gives off unripe plums, lemons and most of all a deep bass acetic note. You explore the nose a little more again and you get that miasma of day old sweat sock funk leavened with a very pleasant lactic, sour milk aroma. Just so homey and comfortingly rustic, you instantly feel your blood pressure dropping through the floor as your heart rate takes on a distinctly Continental cadence. Im ready for some rough bread and a eye-wateringly funky runny cheese.

An almost watery mouthfeel. Carbonation, then an bold tartness followed by a bright sourness that broadens and layers out into wheat bread, graham cracker, honeyed toast, and a brief malt sweetness before sliding into the finish.

The finish is short and the palate is left clean to start to appreciate the palate haunted by lingering ghosts of honeycomb, dates, ume, sour cherries.

4090,"2015-07-13",2.8,"Draft at In De Verzekering Tegen De Grote Dorst, where it was pulled through a tap creating a thin, bubbly, off-white head. Deep, practically clear orange blonde lambic with strong, unusual, very estery and very phenolic aroma of sour cream, lots of soapy wheat, dry wood, very dry sherry, white pepper, bitter grape peel and, weirdly, odd and unpleasant chemical smelling substances... Old lambic alright, but notably different, more spicy and a lot more wry than I am used to from the style. Same for the taste, very wry and astringent, very strong lactic acid, wheat of course, full with complex and strong yeasty spiciness and very dry woodiness. Bitter, even wry, rather than sharply sour. Id like to taste more of this to see how it turns out in other batches, but in this particular sample, at was my least favorite of the five unblended lambics tasted there, I normally love lambic but I could not finish this glass. Difficult to say that something was off here as lambic is off by definition a certain sense, but I do suspect this one had microbes which should not have been there.

4090,"2014-08-15",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2017 MUSEO DELLA BIRRA (BRUGE - 2014) - Non sono assolutamente appassionato di lambic, anche se devo dire che questa mi ha piacevolmente stupito. Il colore è giallo oro torbido, dalla schiuma grossa e poco persistente. Allaroma si avverte un ""gradevole"" odore di fogna e piedi, cosa che si avverte anche in bocca, dove sprigiona un gradevole acidulo non accentuato. Giudizio complessivo: unesperienza emozionante e divertente: non capita tutti i giorni di bere qualcosa che sa di fogna :) 

BEER TEMPEL (AMSTERDAM - 2016): ASPETTO: biondo oro chiaro, leggermente torbido, schiuma bianca, fine, abbondante e decisamente persistente.  AROMA: acido, puzza di fogna, citrico, vinoso. GUSTO: acido elevato, molto limone che pulisce benissimo la lingua e disseta. Un po di fogna si sente :) Amaro erbaceo lieve, ma presente, si sente nella seconda parte del sorso. Vinoso abbastanza accentuato. Quasi nessuna bollicina (purtroppo).

WHITE PONY PUB (Padova - 2017): ASPETTO: biondo oro carico, schiuma quasi assente. AROMA: acido, fogna, e sa anche da merda, come ogni buon lambik che si rispetti! :) GUSTO: acido, ma di un acido putrido, amarognolo marcio, ruggine. Carbonizzazione quasi assente.

4090,"2010-08-21",3.8,"1.5 years old, sampled fresh from the Foeder, July 2010 at Brouwerij F. Boon
The beer pours with an almost clear, gold color and is again completely flat with no head.  This version is very clean and bright smelling compared to the young version.  Lactic acid notes are much more noticeable and are joined by aromas of urea, a nice musky note and even some dirty foot aromatics.  This is not cidery like the young Lambic was and is really nice and smooth smelling.

My first sip of this is nicely tart, though I wouldnt really characterize it as sour yet.  A lactic slickness combines with an oak tannin boost to contribute some body to this flat brew.  The taste of oak lingers in the finish along with a touch of astringency.  Flavors of urea lightly spices the soft sourness of this beer.  This is actually quite tannic and astringent feeling on the palate and is definitely not watery at all.  There is a touch of lemon or grapefruit (klockera bacteria influence perhaps) and perhaps a hint of yeastiness that is still in this not yet finished Lambic.

This is quite nice, perhaps a bit clean yet and there is a bit of astringency to this beer.  This is definitely nice and interesting to try another snap shot in time towards a bottled Gueuze.  This particular foeder is bound for the Gueuze Mariage Parfait in another year and a half.  This should be quite nice when blended up.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Nope, sorry. But after Id settled with a St. Druon de Sebourg, the server sets this on my table, saying ""I just emptied the cask for this, so enjoy!""

4090,"2007-08-14",3.7,"CASK 17B - 90.13 Hectos (Unblended)
Description
Cask 17B has 9013 liters of content, was made of winter oak (quercus petraea) in the 1930-ies and was polished inside before filling. It was filled with two brews, #O71 and #O72 from February 17th and 18th 2004. The original gravity was 15, 30° Plato and the apparent fermentation degree reached 100% in November 2006. At the moment of kegging the alcohol% was 7.9% Vol.
Flavor Notes
The Lambic of this cask has a very nice woody character: cloves, vanilla and the typical whisky-lactone. The abundant lactic acid from the young beer was converted at a high degree into esters, forming together with other ethyl-esters the typical citrus muscat complex. Tannins from the oak and beta-bitterness from the aged hops complete the whisky-bitterness of this wonderful Lambic.
Serving
14°C (57.2°F). If Iambic becomes effervescent, serve it with a pitcher (stir it a little bit) and let it stand for 10 minutes.
7/26/2007:  Clear golden color.  Very acidic and almost like vinegar to the nose.  There is also a little wet blankel funk/mustiness to the aroma.  Flavor is lightly acidic with some faint apple.  Hint of wood and a mild bitterness in the finish.  Light and mellow on the palate.  Very bright overall.
Draught at the Dilly Deli, compliments of Tmoney99.  Thanks Tom.  I appreciate it!  Rating: 8  3  7  3  15 = 3.6

CASK 52 - 87.6 Hectos (Unblended)
Description
Cask 52 has 8670 liters of content. It is an oval cask, made of winter oak (quercus petraea) in 1961 and was half polished inside before filling. It was filled with two brews, #O27 and #O28 from November 5th and 6th 2003. The original gravity was 16.50° Plato and the apparent fermentation degree reached 100% in September 2006. At the moment of kegging the alcohol% was 8.6% Vol.
Flavor Notes
The Lambic of this cask has a nice acidity balance. It has more volatile acids compared to #17B and is more complex. Lactic acid from the young beer was also converted at a high degree into esters, but the typical citrus-muscat complex is enhanced by the volatile acid. The few tannins from the oak are dominated by beta bitterness from the aged hops. The woody whisky-bitterness with a lot of oak-vanilla comes at the end of the taste and lasts for a long moment.
Serving
14°C (57.2°F). If Iambic becomes effervescent, serve it with a pitcher (stir it a little bit) and let it stand for 10 minutes.
7/26/2007:  Clear, light amber in color.  Aroma has a hint of raw honey, light butteriness, and some acidity.  Flavor is mellow and has some wet wood, delicate honey and vanilla, earthy.  Mediu-light body, smooth and milky texture.  More dry than the Cask 17B at times, but oddly also slightly more sweet as well...
