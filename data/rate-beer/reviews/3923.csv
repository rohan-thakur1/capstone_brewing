3923,"2015-05-09",3.4,"Bottle @ THLBBT May. Pours a dark purple beer with a small and quickly disappearing pinkish head on top. Aroma of fruity barnyard funk with some grainy aspects and loads of tarty notes. Big on the raspberries in the aroma and other red fruits as well.

The aroma is very funky with lots of tart fruit, some mild brine. Sheesh its fruity. 

The flavor is puckeringly lemony and sour. Its got loads of tart raspberries. Its dry but its got a huge fruit character. Its got some mild wood. Its about as sour a beer as Ive ever enjoyed, but I sure do enjoy it.

3923,"2015-04-08",2.4,"Bottle 750ml.
Pours purple with very low pink/purple head. No serious lacing. Aroma is of raspberries, leafs, vegetal stuff, fruits. Taste is of raspberries, strong acid, lime-and-fly covered cowshed walls. We are talking very low PH. Palate: Light body. Extremely mouth puckering. Very low carbonation. Overall: Awfull acidity (gross and undrinkable). That is the kind of beer that makes me wonder. Why so sour? It just cannot be healthy to drink this, honestly.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
3923,"2015-04-03",2.9,"Bottle (750 ml). From Jose, thanks! Split-5 ways (6 if we include the drain). 

Appearance: Dark reddish-purple with a medium pinkish-purple head and some lacing. The head disappear rather quickly though.

Aroma: Burst of black raspberries, and its not leafy but really fruit forward. And its not jammy, its just like fresh picked raspberry. Acidic. After a while though, the raspberry fades a bit and theres rubber-ish notes but the aroma is really enticing for the first few minutes.

Taste: Thats were it starts to get bad. It tastes like cheap raspberry vinegar. It wasnt leafy in the aroma, but here it is a bit. Notes of carboard too. But most of all, this is way too friggin sour. 

Palate: And heres the nightmare. Light body, but its not just watery, its worst than that... water has more body than this. Its like sublimated vinegar. Short puckering finish. 

Overall: Enticing aroma, but taste of vinegar and atrocious mouthfeel. Poor drinkability, especially for a 4.4 % abv beer. Grossly overrated. Its the 18th bottle I try from De Garde and either we have really really bad luck or its the most overrated brewery out there. We had a few decent/good beers from them but the vast majority had something ""off"" and they were bad or worst.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3923,"2015-04-03",3.1,"Pours a dark purple with a medium purple-tinted head that leaves zero lacing. Still very good looking, though. Nose is of ripe raspberries: pit, skin and all. Taste is bracingly acid like many De Garde brews and just too much. More acid than raw raspberry juice, lol. Body is light and you keep puckering so much it almost hurt. Carbonation is on the light side as well and mouthfeel is watery. Or maybe it is all the saliva being sucked out of your mouth? Anyway, too hard to drink to be really enjoyable.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3923,"2014-10-19",4.1,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Thanks Ben! 
Aroma is super raspberry forward with a juicy, jammy character. Some light lemon yogurt background character. 
Pours a deep, dark, ruby red with a big, fluffy, pink head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges where it lingers for a bit. 
Flavor is fairly tart but there is also a ton of raspberry character adding just a touch of sweetness. Light lemon and oak notes add a bit of complexity. 
Mouthfeel is medium light to light bodied with high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a super delicious beer. Its all tartness and raspberry with hints of the yeast and oak. Not much base beer character to be found though.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Lemon, vinegar and unripe raspberries are first. Sour cream, grasses and cheese in the middle. Some very mild dry mustiness and grape tannins slightly balance the tartness.
