Viscous and opaque ruby chestnut with some off-white foam. At first near-sickeningly sweet maltgasmic nose of Vitamalz and Malzbonbon slowly gives way to tawny port and some roast chestnuts, still not all that inviting though (lager containment vs ale expressivity). Taste sees layers upon layers of cloying candy sweetness, whilst funnily remaining at least sippable: Sirop de Liège condensed pear and prune sirup, Malzbonbon, massive liquorice, soy and a sweet prune marmelade à bobonne. As it sits and you struggle to take another sip, the beer does develop a bit, mainly into confident desert porto wine territory (the supermarket version, not the Niepoort one), yet gracelessly refuses to shed its marmelade cloak and to really open up to any surprises: the yeast has done its job und macht Feierabend, the plump, double plato dish of fruit sirup is served: how many times will you dig in? N.B. Including the hefty bottle surcharge, this teutonic anomaly seems less worth is take-home entrance fee: this beer was an attraction in its heyday, 20 years ago. Happy Birthday, Süße Heidelberger Omma! An on-premise 0,2L pour makes a great sipper... for a table of 4. Hard to rate, as it is perfectly that which it wants to be: malt soy.

Aroma promises a strong and very malty beer, with a healthy dose of German noble hops.  Also lots of dried fruit in the nose.  The appearance also promises something heavy--viscous opaque black liquid with a dark yellow head of fine bubbles that drops down to a thick ring after not too long.  Rich, velvety liquid with strong molasses-pumpernickel flavour that blends well with the high alcohol.  Some dried fruit flavors come out later in the taste, mingling together with a bitterness at the back of the tongue.  The beer is delicious for 2/3 of the experience, but then it seems to hit  a wall somehow.  The velvety sweet taste just disappears to leave sort of a dry sherry flavour lingering.  Sticky but not overly sweet, with appropriate bitterness.  Huge body, medium carbonation, nutty-bitter finish, but not astringent.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

Big nose - plums, raisins, prunes, figs, chocolate malts, grape jam and fusels. Grape jam stuck with me for some reason, and its more pronounced in the flavor composition, along with molasses, the fruits and malts. Very sweet beer overall, but in a smaller sample its not overpowering. Medium bodied, sticky mouthfeel. Finish is syrupy sweet. Amazingly this beer shares a lot in common with a BW, from the appearance to the flavor profile, just missing a dose of tropical fruits. Good beer.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

1244,"2006-12-16",3.9,"From the bottle, courtesy of a new found best friend who had just come from Baden-Württemberg and picked this up at the Bräuhaus in Heidelberg. As though starved for alcohol, this had to be the best night cap Ive ever had, or atleast whilst in a foreign country, a lively hostel, enjoying the merriment of München, Germany. Harsh!!!Into clear plastic cups - only the finest will do - it poured a crimson amber with much conditioning showing in its sparse, minute carbonation. Head was just a paper sheet of tight bubbles, shaded off-white which managed to hold. No lace due ofcourse to the cup involved. A big hit of malt on the nose initially; clean, sweetish but still well-defined, gritty and grainy. It subsides, alcohol kicks in as does some savoury sultanas, dried peaches and a good settling in of fresh baked Stollenkuche. It drips, it oozes the alcohol but it doesnt lose that typically Deutsch Reinheitsgebot character. It sits well in the mouth, liqueurish, hot but not overdone and heavily enveloped the alcohol is in so much malt. It is like liquid bread, a huge body, silky, viscous on the tongue and oh so warming. Its concentrated Mai-bock. Sweet honey, darker more mulled honey mid-palate, a lot of scrumptious toasted malt hinting an edge of savoury fruits, some strange anise along the sides, a little fresh ginger and pepper-spice in back before a very sweet, complex malt swallow that was like elixir. It was medicinal but in a good way, never have I had a lager you could stand a spoon up in. This was thick, gooey, magnificently malty fun. It worked a treat, slept like a baby.

More soy sauce on the palate, with a really thick worty malt element - like drinking malt extract.

 high alcohol component. Even the nose brings a certain alcohol 
aroma mixed with a stong malt scent. Syrupy. Prune-like or brandy-like with a very long taste profile. This beer just keeps giving and packs a whallup. 
The brewpub is located in the old town of Heidelberg and offers
German pub grub. If you are there with a party, try the large pan
