2670,"2017-05-12",4.2,"Chucks 85th, Seattle. Barrel Roller 2017. Thick, lingering foam on very dark brown body. Interesting nose, almond liquor and smores. Definite marshmallow note on nose along with cookie. Lovely. Thick but not syrupy sip, filled with flavor. A whiff of alcohol but not too much burn. Chocolate base is great with smooth vanilla and almond flavors. Great balance and concept with these adjuncts, and done with such delicacy. Barrel and adjuncts dont get in the way of a delicious beer experience. Alcohol and base snappiness keep it clean. Very nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
