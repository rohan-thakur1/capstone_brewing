2070,"2017-04-27",3.2,"22floz bottle, BOD 06.15.2016, paid $5, poured into a tulip glass. As an American who drinks mostly Americanized versions of Belgian or French style ales, it is difficult to discern what makes a saison a saison and a farmhouse ale a farmhouse ale. Ill review as compared to those Ive had as defined as this style, and styles that are in a similar vein. 

Appears school bus yellow and aroma is like Juicy Fruit brand bubblegum. Heavy and phenolic - floral, orange zest, and aspirin flavors. It has some good and some bad, so sure its okay.","","balloonbuffoon"
2070,"2017-04-07",3.6,"Bomber BOTTLED ON 6/15/16. Nose is explosively fruity, candyish, dusty powdery candy like Fun Dip and Smarties, tries to fill the room. But also a lots of Brett, white grape, honey, pepper, orange, subtle pineapple. Pour clear rich golden with abundant carbonation and a large, soapy off-white head. Taste lightly tart, lightly bitter, bit too much alcohol showing, not too sweet but gets an unnecessary boost from the oily-fruity notes, feels like it will cloy if one goes too fast. Very oily medium body, swishable but with a slight paucity of malt (though still fuller than my Brett beers!), firm spicy prickle throughout, and that persistent Bretty wildness. Musty-damp is there but low-profile, about the same as the cherry lining, at least until strength is gained in the finish. Bubblegum, touch of berry cough drop, very faint vegetal. Alcohol never burns but dulls things a bit, also eventually integrates dangerously. A fun one, but Id rather split this volume. [2017.04.07: 3.6]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

2070,"2016-12-04",4.0,"Bottle shared in NYC. Pours clear or age-gold with a frothy, white head. The nose has bready malts, a little honey and caramel. Medium sweet flavour with lightly toasted malts, dry caramel, faint orange, a little cereal, hints of alcohol. Medium bodied with massaging carbonation. Great balance in the sweet, if sweet as per style, with further toasted cereal, graham crackers, toasted caramel, bready malts. Quite enjoyable.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
2070,"2016-12-02",4.2,"Labeled on Rate Beer as bière de garde, on the label as saison ale brewed with French saison yeast and Brettanomyces. The label also notes that it is a Smuttlabs product. Lots of quick, beige foam that persists. Pours a dark cloudy amber, almost orange. Lots of spice and yeast in the nose with some strong vinous notes. The taste brings out the bright yeast and spice and a touch of melon fruit and green apple. Medium body with active fizz and a good dry finish. Very faint mineral notes, but the strongest flavors are vinous. Some sweetness comes out as it warms up and some slickness to the texture. The alcohol is muted in the flavor but catches up quickly. Far more interesting beer than their Hayseed saison. It almost seems a little too sophisticated for a saison, but very good in any case.","Pennsylvania, USA","PanMarek"
2070,"2016-12-01",3.8,"A very pretty hazy golden hue with lasting bone-white cap. Nose is funk-first, with cracked pepper and a background of lemon zest. Flavor thankfully has some sweet bready malt, though it fades to a semi-bitter blend of pepper and funk. Fairly smooth, and a decently clean finish. I might get into it by the bottom of the bottle, but this things a bit too wild for me.","New Hampshire, USA","tekstr1der"

2070,"2016-10-12",3.2,"Draft sample at the source. The beer is a hazed gold with a white head of foam. Some fruity notes, juicy sweetness. Dry sweet taste. A bit papery. Big body and medium carbonation.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2070,"2016-10-04",4.0,"Golden yellow color; hazy. A big head that never quite fully goes away. Looks like a big old school lager youd drink at a pool table at in a 1970s movie.

Ooooh the aroma! Grains of paradise, prickly and grassy; mint leaf. Inviting and terrific. Elements of buttery shortbread. This smells incredible.

Flavor is first apple juice, then it becomes basement funk, horseblanket, mint leaf, bubblegum, bitter grass. Some sulfurics like steamed broccoli.

The feel is prickly; dances on the tongue. This is a very nice beer with a lot of very interesting flavors. Not ""easy to drink,"" per se, but very pleasant.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"
2070,"2016-08-21",3.2,"Whym, Portsmouth tap: pours orange with a white head. Aroma is bubblegum, yeast and lihht booze. Taste is kind of sweet. Typical biere de garde taste throughout. Not bad for what it is.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
2070,"2016-08-21",3.9,"Thin wisp of foam frm the pour which disappears very quickly. Sour fruit, tart grapes, oranges and straw in the aroma. Color is a hazy muddy orange. Flavor is solid malt up front with a bit of sweetness, dandelion greens, lemon grass, a very slight sourness and unripe bananas. Light alcohol presence. A bit of pasty malts linger along with just a hint of tartness that makes the mouth beg for more. A very easy drinking brew that is light on the bret but big on flavor. Two thumbs up!","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"
2070,"2016-08-21",3.6,"Tallahassee. Fl - Market Square Liquors - 22 oz bomber. Sparkling medium copper pour, prominent soft off-white head that fades after a while. Fruity, full bodied earthy aroma with hints of toffee, melons, some herbal, spicy essence that is hard to pin down, but enjoyable. Solid flavor, some spicy notes, some caramel sweetness, some raw cake mix, pears and butterscotch and a back end of vanilla. Thick, sticky mouthfeel. Pretty solid effort from Smuttynose.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
2070,"2016-07-23",3.9,"Sampler at hayseed. Pours golden with a white head. Doesn't leave much lacing in the glass. Solid Brett notes on the nose. Certainly a nice blending of Brett and funk notes on the tongue. Hides it's booze very well. Finished clean. Maybe my favorite beer of the night so far.

2070,"2016-07-16",3.2,"Bottle date of 06/15/16.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a soft hazy orange color with a slight transparency about it. Fingers worth of white foamy head quickly dies off. No lacing.
The smell starts off with some sweet cherries, light breadiness. Herbal sweetness. Sweet grass/somewhat like sage. Honey, and sweet lemon pulp.
The flavor was basically the same with a big herbal sweetness running into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a semi-syrupy texture about it. Herbal sweetness wants to cling but softly slides on my tongue.
Overall, not a bad biere deGarde by an American brewer though most American brewers tend to get the Mouthfeel in these slightly sticky, hmmm....maybe again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2070,"2016-07-14",3.5,"From the 650 ml. bottle dated 06/15/16. Golden-orange amber pour. Little to no head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, toasted bread crust, sourdough, herbs, and Brett-like sour notes.

Hazy orange color with a fizzy / frothy off white head. Good lacing on the glass. Very nice Saison yeast aroma, with some peppery notes. It has a bit of a mineral component as well. Theres definitely a bretty dryness here in both the flavor and the mouthfeel, but otherwise, I dont get much else from the brett. This turned out quite nice. Dangerous at 9.1%. Holy crap, Batman!

2070,"2015-08-26",2.2,"May 2015 bottle, drunk 8/24/15.A lovely chestnut-auburn colored beer with a large but quickly receding off-white head. Good clarity.LOTS of Belgian Strong Golden-like esters and phenols in the nose...pineapple, banana, clove, vanilla and a slight raw/grainy alcohol edge to it. Not much in the way of brett...dont get much more than a bit of lime-like tartness/acidity. Some light caramel, toasted malt and bread dough round out the malt side of things.Quite dry in the mouth, with a grainy/watery texture, though somewhat ameliorated by the natural carbonation. Unfortunately, I find the yeast character to be pretty raw/crude and harsh. Mixing with the alcohol, its not so much raw ethanol as much as it is warming, drying, sharp fruit-like notes. Just seems like an Americanized Belgian-ale with little class or elegance. Dont get any Biere de Garde yeast notes that Ive ever had, nor do I get much in the way of malt.
