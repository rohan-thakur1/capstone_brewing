Nelson Weisse przypadło mi do gustu. Trzeba przyznać, że to udany pomysł w ramach pewnej koncepcji. Tą koncepcją miało by być uatrakcyjnienie stosunkowo przewidywalnego stylu, jakim jest hefeweizen, ale jednocześnie pozostanie w ramach klasyki. Tutaj uatrakcyjnieniem była nieco podwyższona goryczka oraz rewelacyjne, stonowane egzotyczne nuty chmielowe w aromacie, które dobrze podjęły współpracę z typowymi nutami weizena. Efekt psuje trochę aldehyd octowy (zielone jabłko), ale bez dużej przesady. Osobiście wolałbym także piwo mniej wytrawne - chyba, że otoczenie byłoby bardziej upalne.","","SzopPiwosz"

Excellent rendition of the style.
