1602,"2016-01-28",3.6,"Bottle sampled at Ippudo West. Pours a clear water body with no head or lace. Nose is soft strawberry, alcohol and melon. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with fruity alcohol tones throughout. Good.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1602,"2015-11-14",2.9,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2015 From bottle at Storstad in Regensburg, labelled simply as Ginjo, 14% ABV. Clear and nearly colorless. Aroma is rice, glue, pear, hot alcohols, faint vegetable. Medium-full bodied and burly, though the texture is silky and a little syrupy. Its sweet with low bitterness, alcohols are biting and just below hot in the mouth. Kind of plain but I get the same from most sake, and the glue / chemical notes arent so enjoyable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1602,"2012-01-29",3.9,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is light yellow. Aroma is notes of green/sour apple, flowers, lime, honeydew melon, alcohol, honey, rice. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Medium body, watery/silky texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent. A wonderfully aromatic and clean sake...frankly, in a blind tasting I would almost guess this is a white wine, as there is only a bit of clean rice character to belay its origins.  Otherwise its quite fruity, especially with the apple.  Silky and very well-balanced in the mouth.  A little too alcoholic in the finish, but otherwise quite lovely.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1602,"2011-01-27",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2012 Bottle. Pours with a clear, lightly tinged yellow body and slight legs. Aromas of cedar, banana, kiwi, lychee, koji, minerals, sweetness, candidied coconut and some fruit notes. Flavors are sweet with koji, minerality, stone, lightly lingering bitterness, koji and starchy florals (if that makes sense). Lasting sort of corn sweetness and a musty flavor. An okay, slightly meatier sake. Forgettable and not notable. Medium viscosity, medium refreshing acidity on the finish. Somewhat light for the umami flavors (not what I was looking for from a ginjo). 3.5  Re-rate with a new label. ""Nanbu Bijin Shinpaku Junmai Ginjo"". Pours with a clear body with a light tinge of yellow, moderate legs. Aromas are very fruity up front, with moderate koji presence and a distinct mineral quality. Fruit notes are of lychee, asian pear, mango, papaya and lightly grassy. Taking a sip reveals a medium to ever so slightly fuller body, sweet up front but dries out through the finish. Melon and lychee up front. Rose and floral notes towards the finish. Medium viscosity, well hidden alcohol, light bitterness in the finish. Nice fruity and floral sake. Clean and well balanced. Much fresher than the last time I had it.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1602,"2010-01-25",3.4,"Pours clear with hints of dark gold. Slightly fruity, yeast aroma.Smooth and slightly sweet fruit taste, some mint. A touch sweeter than I like, but good.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1602,"2009-06-20",3.2,"Minty ginger aromas with notes of melon and anise as well.  Pours clear.  Clean upfront, with some cherry and notes of citrus in the finish.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
1602,"2009-03-13",3.4,"From Total Wne...Very very light yellow pour.  Lots of fruit in the nose, some apples and some tropical fruit and a odd smell that I couldnt place.  Flavor is again fruity, leaning towards tropical fruits.  Sweetish and pretty nice.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
1602,"2009-01-26",3.3,"Pours crystal clear, almost lightly grayish in color.  Still bodied, with quick, watery sheeting.  Aromas show sweet sticky rice, coconut water, honeydew melon, koji, and hints of cream.  Traces of new leather arise as well.  Flavors too are quite sweet, almost as sweet as a typical nigori, with big coco-melon fruitiness and some sharp koji.  Alcohol comes through quite a bit on the finish.  Medium bodied and sticky.  Decent sake, but a little saccharine for my taste.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1602,"2008-12-08",3.4,"Very floral and citrus-like sake with lemon and lime notes, a touch of leather and velvet and a nice finish.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
1602,"2008-01-23",3.4,"Thanks for sharing, iowaherkeye. Pale yellowish body. The aroma was somewhat meaty with some sweet woody notes. There was also some melon. The taste was cantalope with some muted floral notes. Perfumed flavors with some toast in the finish also come through. Nice and sweet, easy to drink.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1602,"2007-10-06",3.7,"Just a touch of straw color in this clear sake. Buttery anise scent, lovely. Slightly sweet, slick feel. Light honeydew flavor up front with a warm alcohol middle and an unusual almond paste finish. Yum! I do miss these Tohoku Jizakes!","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
1602,"2007-06-08",3.6,"this is a robust, potent fruity sake. the aroma is apples and floral overtobes. the is slightly oily with a full mouthfeel. taste is mighty sweet with fruits, mild rice and alcohol tastes. A real winner.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1602,"2007-06-08",2.4,"The aroma is sweet and fruity with rice and alcohol. The appearance is yellow clear. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin and not too oily. Pretty good example of a sweet sake.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1602,"2007-03-11",3.5,"Weak oak bouquet.  Medium-dry with a fruity taste evoking pears.  Balanced with a medium-body and long finish.","USA","ldr514"
1602,"2007-01-16",3.1,"300mL bottle, no date.  Pours clear with the slightest hint of pale yellow--Ive probably drank water less clear than this.  Legs appear after about a second and a half.  Some definite musty aromas, though slight.  Green apple candy, some melon and a hint of white sticky rice in there as well.  Flavor is much the same, though the apple quality is much more subtle.  Some alcohol burn is noted.  Pretty watery, I think this one is a bit overpriced--though I cant remember exactly what I did pay for it.  I will admit I am a bit naive on sakes, but this one hasnt quite been up to par with others Ive tried.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
1602,"2005-11-10",4.0,"Very nice, smooth and slightly fruity on the mid-palate. Elements of light honey-dew melon and canalope slowly puch their way through the initial rice spirit taste and leave abrublty as a smooth watery finish exists.","Charleston, USA","Bigsilky"
1602,"2004-03-05",3.5,"Candy/floral aroma that's very promising!  A very nice Ginjo from IWATE Prefecture, a place not particularly known for its brewing prowess.  However, this neutral-to-sweet sake delivers on the all-important smoothness category.  In short, it delivers its 16% alcohol payload without a lot of fuss or burn.  The finish is also rather sweet with a honeyish taste.  Not at all astringent, I'd actually guess this sake is a SMV -2 due to its sweetness.  Drinking the Nanbu Bijin side-by-side with the Kubota Hekiju, the former almost holds its own, being a little yellower in color than the mighty Kubota - the 600-pound gorilla of the sake world.  Sadly, there is the slightest touch of harshness in the aftertaste.  A watery consistency with little oiliness gives evidence of its pedigree.  I would really look forward to trying one of their Daiginjos, if I could get my hands on it here in NYC!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
