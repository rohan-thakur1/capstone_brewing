2813,"2016-12-10",3.7,"Pale straw coloured beer. The nose is slightly sulfurous with a touch of grassy hoppiness. Theres a bit of fruit and some light heat as well. Light bodied and cleanly fermented. Assertively bittered. Nice quaffable brew.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
2813,"2016-07-13",4.1,"Arguably the best pils. Ive ever had. Big floral grassy, spicy notes with hint if lemon and lime zest with subtle tropical fruit. Carb and mouth feel are perfect. Finish is grassy, and hoppy with big Green hop cones notes and subtle tropical fruit and citrus zest and some light peppery spicy notes. Incredible stuff.... The malts still come through, pale crystal malts ate still evident and upfront. Great stuff.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"

Arôme de houblon herbacé, agrumes, malt pilsner, levure, ananas? Goût de malt, houblon herbacé, agrumes, amertume moyenne et fugace.

2813,"2016-06-06",3.6,"Tap at Burdock. Pale, slightly hazy yellow with small off-white head. The aroma is grassy but not in the classical pilsnery sense, floral, citric. Really nice. Plus some tropical fruits. Tastes sweet and bitter, fruity, quenching, lingering citric bitterness in the finish. Soft on the palate but not without a bit of a zingy sharpness. Mellow carbonation; some mineral aspects. The Pilsner is rather hidden behind the IPA traits. Overall very enjoyable.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"
2813,"2016-02-10",3.7,"Loving this beer lately. Lovely vibrant yellow with a mildly dank nose. Flavour is bright on the palate with good sharp bitterness that fades to a refreshing crisp finish.","Ontario, CANADA","RoseGambrinus"
2813,"2016-02-08",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2016 20160620: After several more of these, have to increase my rating, this is an excellent beer. Pours a very pale gold/yellow with slight haze, fairly dense but fast dissipating pure white head. 50/50 mix of a familiar pilsner grain aroma and pretty fresh hop aroma. Body is light but the carbonation is pleasant and you can feel a slight oiliness in the texture. Flavour is dry with juicy hops, taste leans a bit towards APA. Bigger beer than I expected from a pilsner, pretty nice.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Listigovers"

2813,"2016-01-03",3.8,"My quest to locate an interesting local pilsner takes a full stop here. Well, hello there little hop bomb pils, come on up & see me. Lets be honest, its more IPA than pils (dig those stanky ganga-like hops) than it is a pilsner (sure, it hits a few points of the style (ie that absorbic acid like flush in the finish)) but it doesnt matter in the long run as its a) a great little beer & b) going to be a repeat purchase next time I storm their bottle shop. A couple of further thoughts: Id like to do a side-by-side tasting of this with their IPA & see if this is just their IPA tweaked to pilsner but I cant right now cuz I downed all of my research bottles. Also, in terms of hopped up pilsners, I still prefer the bombastic Victory Prima pils I had in the States last Spring. Regardless, quality brew.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
2813,"2015-12-20",4.2,"[7804-20151011] Tap. Dry white wine and toasted doughy bread aroma. Clear, pale yellow body with a medium-lasting creamy white head and some lacing. Bitter dried grass hops and lightly toasted grainy seeds flavour. Medium body. Very easy to drink and this has instantly become my favourite pilsener (a style I do not usually enjoy); I love Burdocks twist on it. (8/4/9/4/17) 4.2
