3614,"2014-05-18",3.7,"Cask. Amber-red, vibrant colour slight haze. This had a sparkler but it looked awesome. The fresh ekg dry hops are very evident. Soft body, maybe a bit slick but with a touch of cask acidity . Hit of caramel, getting into toffee. Earthy hop character. Increases in complexity as it goes.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

3614,"2012-09-16",3.5,"Draft. Deep amber body with an off-white head, rapidly diminishing. Aroma of biscuit, caramel, toasted malts, citrus. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Caramel taste on top of bread and mustiness. Neither the aroma nor flavor are overly strong, but theres a good balance between malt and hop with a light lingering bitterness. Tasty for a 4% session beer. Reminded me of a lighter version of their chin wag esb.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
3614,"2012-08-12",3.6,"Pour on tap at the brewery, cask pour with Delta hops.  Nice dark orange pour with fluffy white slightly eggshell white head, how can you say a cask beer looks bad?  Aroma had nice caramel, musty earth, hints of a biscuit and rich bready malts, slight hint of DMS but it didnt detract too much.  Taste had a bit more of the DMS which wasnt bad for the style, but its not a flavor I enjoy, though I know its sought after in this style, so I didnt dock it.  Nice musty earth, caramel, toffee, bread some yeast and spicy tones, slight grassy hops.  Pretty nice.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"

3614,"2012-07-21",3.8,"Cask at the brewery - not sure of the hops used in this firkin, but the flavor profile seems like a mix of British and German noble - the beer is very dry, but with a doughiness the the body that adds some heft and a light estery note - for the most part, the malts are biscuity and semi dry - the hops add a complex fruitiness - a touch of dry minerals throughout - hints of damp earthiness and wood - very nice, indeed.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3614,"2012-07-16",3.9,"firkin at the brewery.  brown sugar added, no finings.  a mixture of English ale yeast and Fuggles, EKG and Challenger hops gives it a musty, spicy, woody, earthy, mushroom and soil nose with queit but layered notes of toated grains, very light apple eaters and touches of concrete mix / damp basement . strikingly clear copper with fine, soft, velevrty natural carbonation. toasty caramel and brown sugar malt and lightly spiced red apples at play throughout, with mild mushroom and wet wood and touches of faint noble hops.  wonderfully quenching with superbly firm and lightly acidic and doughy malt.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
