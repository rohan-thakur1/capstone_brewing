199,"2014-06-20",3.6,"12th June 2014Tasting at Bruces pad. Thanks to Paul. Hazy deep amber beer, small pale tan head. Palate is light and crispy. Good barrel action here - vanilla oak, fruity bourbon, light spice. Whisper of fruits. Mild minerals. Light dry finish. Lots of barrel spicy linger. Tasty stuff but base beer is battered!",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
