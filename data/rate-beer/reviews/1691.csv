This was poured into a becher pint glass. 
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a two finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace leaving some light stringy foamy lacing. 
The smell had a nice rich roasty smooth coffee aroma bursting over a delicate amount of chocolate underneath. Light bitter roots of black licorice slide in further underneath.
The taste was moderately bitter with the roasty portion backing it all up nicely. Light roasty to sweet aftertaste and a dry roasty finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light. Bitter and roasty feels stroll across my tongue.

Anyway, doesnt take too much away from this tasty brew, which is opening up quite nicely. Dry roasted grain, nut, chocolate, coffee flavor. On the thin side, as the style dictates, but actaully has a nice amount of body to it. Carbonation is a bithigh, so a little swirling does lessen that a bit and smooth things out.

1691,"2014-07-08",3.6,"December 16th, 2012 - By the very name if it, Moylans Brewery was designed to brew a Dry Irish Stout, just by the name of the brewery. And to all appearances, theyve done a wonderful job making something that trumps the classic Guinness. In visual style it is much the same, with a deep, dark brown all the way through, and a thick cap of foam on the top (though not so velvety as Guinness, it is close.) The smell is like the inside of a granary, with toasted oats and barley, like a thick and slightly burnt oatmeal, dusted with chocolate shavings and cocoa powder - addicting and satisfying. A sudsy palate delivers a beer that goes down smooth and easy (again, like Guinness), light and even ethereal. Toasted oats dominates the flavor here too, with a nice assertive maltiness that generates sweetness all the way through. This comes across as a step above Guinness at every step, with more substance, a stronger flavor, and probably more calories too.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Aroma: The nose is rather roasty and malty mostly, with some notes of coffee and caramel

Appearance: It pours an opaque brown-black color with a small light brown head and spotty lace

Flavor: The taste is lightly sweet, with a big roasted malt presence to it, and a lightly bitter finish

Palate: The body is medium-full, with a creamy feel, an average-lively carbonation, and a dryish finish

Le goût est dominé par une torréfaction qui se détend au contact de légères pointes chocolatées.  En bouche, le liquide, au corps plutôt élancé, me semble bien animé par un pétillement vivifiant : sa texture échappe ainsi quelques notes crémeuses.

This is a rather nice looking stout, It pretty much looks like a nitro pour Guinness w/o the horrible tragedy that is nitro. That is what I like to see and the good folks at Moylans deserve a pat on the back for doing an outstanding job. Overall, this is a very nice dry stout. It is pretty par the course for the style, roasty but not terribly bitter, dry yet balanced and very drinkable. Carbonation is mild but enough to add just a bit of interest. It might be lean a bit toward the watery side but its really rather flavorful, esp. considering the gravity. I would way rather have this than another syrupy mess of an imperial stout.

Notes of vinegar dominated with chocolate, soy sauce, rotting dark fruit meat and roastiness.

Flavor follows aroma: great example of Irish Dry Stout with lots of roast flavors, light toasty malt character, virtually no sweetness, and earthy British hops. There is a nice green, earthy hop bitterness at mid-palate that accentuates the dry roasty character. The finish is dry and much like a lightly hoppy black coffee with subtle creaminess and even more subtle sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and light-bodied with a strong crispness (unexpected - surprised they chose to push with CO2 instead of Nitrogen).

Smell: Roasty, earthy nose with notes of chocolate, cold coffee, burnt grains, smoked aniseed, and dark caramel.

Taste: Toasted, roasted maltiness with tastes of bittersweet chocolate, charred barley, and mild coffee in the foreground and tastes of spicy anise, smoke, and dark caramel in back. Earthy hops with a medium amount of bitterness that joins with a slight roasted grain astringency. Finishes dry and roasty with a lingering hint of roasted grain in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth with a slight chalkiness to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Paired well with the movie ""The Quiet Man"". Though Id like to see how this fares under a nitro-tap, its still enjoyable in bomber bottle form. Id prefer a hair more body and creaminess, but its acceptable as is. At least it isnt guilty of what so many self-labeled dry stouts are -- having almost no flavor.

Through this silky Stouts healthy malt metabolism pulses chocolate, coffee and vanilla, a perfectly amenable and attractive blend that almost rendered this dessert lover lustful.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam tops the brown-tinged black.
-I have to admit the flavor profile was pretty sweet for what is billed as a ""Dry Stout"".
-Subtle roastiness in the finish dries out most of the dextrins.
-The aroma is very seductive, and the flavor profile delivers what was promised.
-There were no notes of sourness that some here have mentioned.
-This is very drinkable; a bomber can go down in no time.

1691,"2008-08-12",3.6,"22 oz bottle from Holiday Wine Cellar. A deep roasted malt nose that smells rich and creamy and a perfect example of how my memory would the aroma of a stout. Appears as a pitch black liquid with a small forming of foam for a head. The flavor is tad bit bland and simple but in general it still holds a decent amount of burnt dark malt and a hint of Irish cream or hazelnut in the finish.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

1691,"2008-08-06",3.2,"A vigorous pour into my New Belgium globe goblet produces an almost three-finger thick, lightly browned, dark tan colored head.  The beer is quite black in color, though it does pass just a hint of light through it if held up directly to the light.  The aroma smells quite dry and full of roasted, dark malt notes; reminiscent of well, almost blackened, grain, charcoal, dry espresso, burnt soda crackers and perhaps a hint of a dark grain sweetness.  That last may just be my imagination though as this beer is clearly roast dominated and it is hard to get a sense of anything else in the nose.

Dry with a fizzy, carbonic acidity that sort of adds to the overall dryness.  Ample flavors of well deeply toasted grain move to more of burnt and even bitter finish that lingers on just a bit after the beer has left my mouth.  There is some burnt grain acidity here, though not quite as much as one might expect (the mash PH seems to have been held well enough in check).  This actually does get fairly bitter and slightly astringent in the finish from the burnt grain focus.  Despite being so dry, this does have a touch of body to it, though the fizziness of the carbonation tends to get in the way of the texture despite being fairly light (in carbonation).  A couple of vigorous swirls of my glass release most of the carbonation and greatly reduces the harsh carbonic bit and makes this beer more creamy and less astringently burnt.  As the beer warms up a bit it even picks up a slight burnt fruitiness that helps to further add a bit of balance.

I am a bit surprised to say it, but this is actually probably better on Nitro, or preferably from the hand pump; the reduced carbonation and carbonic acidity would really help to keep this beer more balanced.  And the beer does actually smooth out, become more integrated and not as overtly roasted if I vigorously swirl out the carbonation; serving this on the warm side certainly helps too.  Not exactly the best beer to be drinking out of the bottle, if you work at it you can turn this into a nicely drinking beer though.  I would love to have this served via hand pump from a cask at about 59°F / 15°C.

L: Dark chocolate brown with a fluffy tan head that slowly settled into a creamy skim. Splotchy rings of lace circles the brim of the glass, Dragoons is a traditional and appealing looking Dry Irish Stout.

S: Charcoal, charred grains and mildly roasted coffee with some light fruity esters at the edges. Further whiffs reveal hints of milk chocolate and lemon zest. There are also traces of a herbal licorice. A pretty impressive nose for an Dry Irish Stout, easy to believe that Dragoons is a multi-award winner.

F&T: This has a nice airy, creamy feel in the mouth, properly light bodied, an amazing smooth drinkability, I am having to restrain myself from gulping this down. Good roasted malt flavor, barley grains, nutty coffee, chocolate licorice and a touch of sweetly dark fruits. Towards the end a delicate lemony, spicy hoppiness emerges, helping to give Dragoons a neatly dry finish.
