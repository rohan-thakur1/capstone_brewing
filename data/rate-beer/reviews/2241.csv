Theres also some metallic tone to it. Its not really offensive but definitely off when taken together. Taste has moderate to medium sweetness. Its thin, very light caramel.

2241,"2013-02-02",3.4,"A steady pour into my New Belgium Globe glass produces an almost three finger thick, pale tan colored that leaves lots of lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is a rich, slightly browned, amber color that shows a cant get any more brilliantly clear, almost metallic looking, deep red tinged, copper color when held up to the light. The aroma smells lightly tart, herbal / grassy (sort of like fresh cut nettle), woody notes that remind me quite strikingly of cedar, and a funky, sort of caramelized mushroom like, musty, and slightly musky character. Softer, more subtle notes of nutty malt oxidation, apple like fruitiness.

Nicely effervescent, even prickly, but not nearly as sweet as that Strubbe beer I just had, but there is a touch of sweetness here. The nettle like, sort of cedar leaning character from the nose is lightly here in the flavor. Nicely tart, with a lactic leaning sourness. A touch of nutty character barely sneaks through, and the oxidation also seems to have something to do with the cedar like notes here. The body is light enough that this is quite drinkable; it has a light touch of body to it, without really clinging to the palate at all.

The cedar and nettle notes are quite interesting here; it is interesting how distinct they are. This doesnt seem as sweet as many a Faro, is that b/c I have had this for a couple years, or is it just that the last beer I had was quite a bit too sweet.

Pretty enjoyable, and makes me rethink the Bruerys Pharaoh (as far as it not showing enough sugar character). A good amount of funk which I love from both of Girardins 1882 Gueuzes. Horseblanket, tobacco, grassy, earthy, straw, lemon, sandalwood, humidor. Pretty complex, but missing overall on the acidity. An interesting bitter nearly tannic note on the finish (wood tannin possibly). Quite lively on the palate with playful carbonation. Fuller bodied and not quite as dry as a gueuze, but still decently dry and medium to light bodied. No visible alcohol. Overall, one of the better real Faros that I have had the opportunity to try thus far (definitely the best bottled one). Enjoyable funk with only enough sweetness to challenge the sourness. Nice!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

A rather mild smell, restrained and easygoing for a lambic. You can tell that the vinegar and funky notes ad subdued by the sweetening. Still some vinegar, apples, lemon, grass and hay. Gentle funkiness as well. Some tart fruity aromas.

The taste is also restrained and gentle. It lacks a little complexity and perhaps some balance but its still tasty. Nice fruity notes of apples and some cherries. Lemons. Mild tartness balanced by a well integrated sweetness. Luckily, the sweetness doesnt have that candy-like feel to it that some overly sweetened lambics have. Restrained notes of wet hay, barnyard and earthy yeast. The finish is dry with a refreshing tartness, citric notes and a gentle grassy bitterness. Some slightly too prominent mineral notes in the finish as well.

Moderate to light body. The carbonation seems a little off, its like the bubbles are too big or something.

A very easy to drink lambic with mellow flavors and a restrained tartness due to the sweetening. Refreshing. All in all, not a bad beer.

The aroma shows notes of musty, earthy, fermenting fig and other dark fruits, followed up by caramelized sugar sweetness and mildly funky, oaky tartness.  There is a very faint hint of aged floral hops on the nose.  Flavors are sweet-tart, caramelized fig and fruit soured by notes of apple cider and old, wet wood.

2241,"2007-10-13",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
The fruitiness of tangy citrus and peach skins arbors the calculated wooden funk, as the brown sugar cornerstone progressively attenuates this lambic character until the tranquil finish is reached. This is a well-carved quencher which might help a few into the appreciation of lambic family products.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the clear twilight orange.
-The tiny bubbles are fierce and expansive; this one gets better as it breathes.
-I would like that tartness to be prolonged somewhat, but then again that might make this stray from the style too much.
-There is enough funk throughout to recognize the lambic within.

Rating #500Thanks to hopdog for sending this in a recent trade.  Ive been looking for something special and this seems to be appropriate.  Since it is possibly the hardest style to find, I figured I would save it for a special occasion.  Having sampled it I would love to try a fresh faro to see how they compare.  Despite not having very many expectations it was still a bit of a letdown for a rare style.
Aroma / Appearance - The deep brown body had almost no carbonation or head instead swirling around the glass easily.  A sweet fruity smell permeated the space above the glass with raspberry and blueberries.  There was a trace amount of funkiness but nothing like what you get from other lambics.
Flavor / Palate - The taste of semisweet lemons is soon followed by tart raspberries.  It reminds me alot of Lipton iced tea mixed with nutrasweet or powdered sugar.  The finish is dry and sour but not harsh.  This is definitely one of the most unique beers I have tried.  While it is sippable and easy to drink Im not sure I would want more than a single bottle at once.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma is pretty subdued, some light earthy funk, light fruitiness, a little candi/brown sugar, and some soft maltiness.  The most Gueuze like Faro of the 5 Ive had, with a fairly minimal sugar presence.  The sugar that is there tastes alot more raw than the others as opposed to the more refined sugar taste of the others.  The sugar just takes that acetic sour bite away that some folks find offensive about Gueuze instead of completely covering it up.  Alot more crisp and bitey than the other 4 as well on the finish.  Mouthfeel is quite nice, lively fine carboination with minimal stickiness on the finish.  A slight acetic bite late in the finish.  Clearly the best of the bottled Faros available, and easily the most drinkable.  The only one of the bunch of 5 that Id ever buy again.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2241,"2007-04-02",2.5,"Thanks to hopdog for breaking out this bottle. Stamped 01 04 on the cork...
Appears a transparent light amber with a small, light tan head the quickly fades away. Nary a bit of lacing is left around the glass. Tiny amounts of CO2 rise to the top.
Smell is of butter cream, caramel, brown sugar, light funk, oxidation, and mild cork.
Taste is sugary up front, rubbery, fresh plastic bags out of the box(if that makes sense), and light brown sugar.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly tannic of wood, a bit of a ""yuck"" factor with the plastic notes and junky garbage outweighing the intriguing wild yeast notes that are present.
This is a weird style and Ive got nothing to really compare it against. Im going by my overall impressions of this brew.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Poured a hazy hazelnut with a frothy white head into a nucleated glass, so the head stayed until the bitter end. Nice sticky lacing.
Smell of apple, grapefruit and wet rope, with a splash of vinegar and  a dollop of vanilla. Taste is citrus sharp up front, a burst of apples in the middle and a tasteful sour finish.

2241,"2006-06-30",3.8,"On tap into gueuze glass, Delirium Tremens, Brussels.  Translucent brown sugar in its own tumbler; tan head keeps a thin cover on the beer for a long time.  Sudsy lace is uniform and frothy, racing deep and slow in bubbly rivulets beneath the surface.  Apricot and sawdust on the nose with an accent of charred maize (like Indian corn that sat on a grill for too long).  Nice round acid character provides a tart sourness like apples in the middle, all surrounded by soft cobweb yeast.  Finishes kind of like a German lager at the start when the hops peek through, then settles into more sourness and a bit of prickly bitterness.  Sweetness all the way through keeps this from ever being dry, and a solidly medium body with subdued carbonation keeps it from quintessential summer beer status (not that I would need one sitting at a table outside in Brussels today, since Im sure its below 50 degrees right now); that being said, very refreshing.  As the beer warms, the grilled corn emerges sometimes from underneath the blanket of sour apple flavor.  Enjoyable as my first Belgian beer in Belgium.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

The taste is more sour than expected; similar in some ways to a Flemish Red with that woody oaky feel, and old red fruit, but there is the sugariness dwelling deep down.

Its difficult to conceive that Id ever go as far as saying I disliked a Girardin lambic, but, as with all Faros, I find myself thinking, whats the point? Make a world class lambic, with all the cheesy, farmyardy, tart qualities you expect. Then dump a load a sugar in to make it more palatable to people that dont like what makes lambic great.

2241,"2004-08-05",2.9,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2009 Amber-brown with a thick, bumpy head.  Sugary nose has hints of toffee.  Sweet and sour palate, the former being very caramel/toffee sweet and the latter being a clean lactic tartness.  Theres a bit of lemonyness in there as well.  The result is a fairly aggressive faro - probably the least faro-like faro Ive had.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

2241,"2004-06-19",4.0,"Deep reddish brown coloured. Aroma of caraamel and acidic vinegar. Well balanced flavour with sugary sweetness and lambic sourness and tartness. This is very tasty.

The flavor is dominated by grapefruit and is sweet on a sour background with notes of wood lending it a dryness and hints of brown sugar. The sourness is not that accentuated, but yet it draws some mouthwater. It ends on a note of grapefruit.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
