Caramel and chocolate chips lead to a fruity second half in this effervescent Extra Stout.

-This doesnt feel like 8% at all.
-The nose isnt too exciting for the style.
-Light roastiness is occasionally tasted.
-This was great with steak on the grill.

1642,"2013-07-11",3.6,"Pours a dark brownish-blackish-ruby-hued when held up to the light sorta color. The head is rocky and large with lots of lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is complicated & interesting... it comes right away with some chocolate, then some smoke, gives way to to some dark fruit & odd banana esters, theres some charred wood in there... gracious. I sort of love it, but then I sort of think the banana stuff brings it down a notch. What a delightfully odd smelling beer. 

The flavor is similarly strange and somehow delightful, the chocolate flavor is hardly reminiscent of sweet chocolate at all, its more like the 80%+ end bitter chocolate, which pretty much is awesome. The beer is far from ""dry"" though, its got a light caramel sweetness to it that makes some of the more bitter and bold flavors work better than maybe they could on their own devices. There is certainly a good lot of roastiness going on here, ashy... espresso like, strong, stark, roastiness. Some of that fruity phenol thing come through but not to the degree that it does in the aroma.

Kind of spicy. Some chocolate, raisin. Earthy, spicy hop. A lot of spiciness, really. Very dark brown, though mostly clear color. Slight red. Appears mostly dark though. Thin khaki head. Leaves decent lace initially, but quickly fades to just a minimal ring with nothing sticking. Moderate-plus bitter taste. Moderate-plus sweet, kind of a spicy bite to it. Softer-textured moderate strength carbonation. Dry finish. Medium to bigger body, mildly chewy. Didnt enjoy this nearly as much as I did last time. Sweet maltiness, spicy bite. Disappointed. Didnt finish.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

1642,"2011-03-29",2.5,"Alcohol very noticeable in the aroma, but other than this, the aroma is quite complex: moderate roast, not overwhelming but with a burnt quality, deep fruity tones, caramel, slightly dry finish but more sweet and sour.  Upon drinking more of the beer though, the aroma becomes more muddled.  If youre paying attention to it, you can appreciate the complexity and sense the different aspects to the aroma, but perhaps because of the high alcohol content and the fact that the alcohol is dominant in the aroma, if youre just drinking it casually, everything blends together and the effect is more generic.  The nuance in this beer can thus easily go unappreciated.  Overall, Im not a huge fan of this.  I think theyd do well to tone down the alcohol content: it seems to detract from the experience of drinking this beer and it doesnt mesh well with the beers other qualities.  I also found this beer to be a tad on the heavy side: too sweet too.  I think it would work better if it were similar, but less sweet and lower in alcohol.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

12 oz bottle that I actually had sitting around from last year. Pours just a shad under black. I can still see some reddish hues along the edges. A bubbly tan one finger head rests atop that dissipates to a small ring.
Aroma is roasted and earthy malts. And even a dried fruit sweetness. Last year I noted that there was an unpleasant worcestershire sauce smell. Im not getting that this time.

Getting some sweet chocolatey malt flavors. A hint of underlying fruitiness. Roasted and ever so slightly smoked malts. This beer aged well. Im enjoying it a lot more than I did previously. Its a bit more complex.

This beer is full bodied and drinks exceptionally smooth. This time around I think its a bit more sweet than the roasty flavor this style should have. However, Im enjoying it much better this second time around.

Initial rating: 1/28/11 Total score: 3.1 

Pours a deep black. Has a weird worcestershire sauce aroma that I dont care for. with roasted malts. and smokiness. Flavor is better than the smell. Bitter coffee flavors come through, roasty caramel malts. slight hop bitterness. Medium body with a short finish. Very smooth and creamy though. I was told ""this is what Guinness would taste like if Guiness was good."" Its not bad but I think it was overhyped.","Hagerstown, Maryland, USA","Nimrod979"

12 ounce bottle, with about 8 ounces poured into a snifter glass.  Little to no head in the pour, despite my attempts to get something out of it.  What little head their is collects in a small ring at the outside of the glass.  Pours a very dark black the consistency of motor oil.  Smells surprisingly fruity, with notes of raisin followed by the typical stout smell of roasted barley and chocolate.  Some almond notes are there too.  Surprisingly bubbly on the palate, with the roasted chocolate followed by more roasted notes and some coffee.  Hop character is there, but not exactly easy to find and its mainly in the finish.  Hard to believe this is an Extra Stout with the 8% ABV.  One would expect this to be heavy, almost syrupy, but thats not the case.

Good amount of milky chocolate and caramelized malts. A light brown sugar and raisin hint as well. A real nice mixture of sweetness and slightly charred aromas.

Some deep caramel sweetness comes out then, with some earthy notes and a slightly smoked-meat-like finish. Not bad.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

1642,"2008-03-17",3.7,"Bottle born on Feb 5, 2008. Pours a deep, dark brown/red/black with a whispy head. The aroma surprised me. After having a couple Schlafly stouts now, I had this conception of what to expect. However, this is a little different. I get some pleasing peaty Scotch aromas, cigar, vanilla, and even some papery hops coming through. Mouthfeel is a little weird for what is going on here, but its not bad. Carbonation is low and its pretty slick. The flavor has some sharp, bitter sweet tobacco going on with a hint of vanilla, licorice, and teriyaki jerky. I wouldnt say this is a typical foreign/Caribbean style stout. Its almost a Scotch ale-stout hybrid. I like it.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1642,"2007-03-11",3.9,"Bottle.  Body is dark brown, almost black with a half inch tan head.  Aromas are somewhat weak and dont do a great job advertising what is to come, but suggest a burnt malt with a sweet character.  Maybe a touch of chocolate and molasses, too, but that could just be some interference from the flavoring.  Mouthfeel is creamy and a somewhat thick, flavor has dark chocolate, molasses and a creamy finish.  There are some smokey/peat notes, too, but they are subtle and dont take over the show.  Overall, the main interest here is the creamy flavoring and mouthfeel, which makes this a stout unlike any others that I have tried.  While the flavoring and development could be slightly improved on, the way in which this blends an 8% ABV into a silky and smooth package is remarkable.  It is a very different from other imperial stouts that Ive tried due to its well-concealed alcohol and smooth finish.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

It also has flashes of coffee in there.  Taste is dry toffee sweetness with bittersweet chocolate and coffee thats finishes in a dry tart bitterness.  Ive actually got touches of apple juice in the initial taste, this sometime eludes and do not always get this impression.  This is not an imperial stout nor a sweet stout.  This I believe as drmatt said is a foreign.  Reasoning is foreign stout is a style that originated with the likes of true guiness extra stout. It was originally shipped to places like sri lanka which in turn created there own (Lions stout).  I know it doesnt matter that much except in style percentage but it does fit all specs and descriptors of other beers in this style.","Cabot, Arkansas, USA","smhncabot"

Regardless, aroma is where this baby shines.  Rich robust vanilla and coffee with cinnamon rolls and sweet frosting give this beer a real breakfast appeal.  The head is dense and tan and lingers to the end.  The flavor, unfortunately, falls flat and is too lactic sweet for endulgence.  In fact, it tastes like a flat Mackeson XXX (further evidence for my ""sweet stout"" claim).  Palate is creamy with some licorice and cough medicine.  All in all, this is pretty good for a Schlafly product, which I generally find to be stale, fake and lackluster.","Salem, Missouri, USA","humulus"
