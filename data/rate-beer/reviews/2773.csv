2773,"2012-02-12",3.4,"Pivovarsky Klub, Prága. Áttetsző, világosabb árnyalatú barnásvöröses színe, illetve közepes méretű piszkosfehér habja van. Illata malátás, karamellás, mogyorós és erősen aszalt gyümölcsös, valamint gyógyfüvesen komlós. Íze hasonló, nem túl édes, a komló is ki tud bontakozni, ám mégsem túl kiegyensúlyozott. Kissé olajos, de könnyedén iható és a szénsavassága is rendben van. Csehes újraértelmezése a baksöröknek, egyébként nem rossz.","Budapest, HUNGARY","mattphilips"
2773,"2012-01-27",3.9,"Draugth at Prague Beer Museum, 15 cl. First of all I wonder if this beer really is a Bohemian Pilsener. At Prague Beer Museum it is sold as an Amber Lager, and the full tastes of caramell, christmas herbs and some cherry doesn´t make this a typical pilsener at all. Whatever, this is just a beatiful beer, with loads of aroma and taste.","Varberg, SWEDEN","mzaar"

2773,"2010-12-19",2.6,"looked like one of those peel-less marmalades (an abomination in my opinion - the marmalade, not the colour of the beer). The nose reminded me of various Christmasy type things, the sweetness of honey and a light spiciness of gingerbread, with just a subtle hint of vanilla. It was quite sweet, and a little syrupy, and I felt it could have done with a touch more bitterness. As the drink wore on, I am convinced I got a whiff of glue - not sure what was going on with that, but certainly it was there.","Gordonsville, Virginia, USA","Velkyal"
