1231,"2017-05-26",3.2,"Ar: Deep toasty malt; steely clean yeast profile; slight caramel. Ap: Deep amber-orange; small off-white head with moderate-low retention, leaving a ring of motley bubbles and a very fine cap of mostly-covering haze. T: Toffee and caramel up front, transitions into deep toasted malt; medium-low sweetness; clean alcohol warmth; slight black tea astringency, with a medium-low bitterness; finish is clean booze, medium caramels, and sticky toast. P: Medium-full body; medium-high carbonation; creamy; finish is medium-dry. O: Interesting interpretation of the doppelbock style that is drinkable but misses the mark; rich maltiness is pronounced, though some of the caramel and alcohol flavors are too prominent, unbalancing the beer somewhat, distracting from the deep base-malt toastiness and smoothness of a great doppelbock.","Plainfield, Vermont, USA","Jabic"

1231,"2016-11-24",4.0,"2014 vintage.
Poured into a lager glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt amber almost brown color with an ever so sly transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a one and a half fingered white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Moderate sticky lace running here and there.
The aroma takes on sweet bready malts nuanced by sweet rich dark fruits. Sly allspice. Dark chocolate. Milk chocolate. Roasted nuts.
The flavor blends all of those aromas together superbly. Malty smooth semi-sticky aftertaste flowing into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionabiltiy about it. Carbonation seems to have been fairly dissipated, but I expected that.
Overall, damn nice aged dopplebock that I would love to have again and am hoping to find a fresh one. 2014 bottle really aged awesome!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Das Bier ist orange-braun und schön trüb. Sehr malzig-schwerer Geruch. Riecht schon sehr gehaltvoll! Der Antrunk ist vollmundig-süffig und sehr schön malzig. Zum Hauptteil wird das Bier komplex-malzig und angenehm süß. Schwerer Körper. Leichte Röstmalztöne. Ganz leicht säuerlich. Dabei auch gelbe Früchte und eine leicht mild-hefige Note. Der Nachgeschmack ist sehr fruchtig-malzig. Lang anhaltend. Ganz leicht süßlich-klebrig, aber nicht negativ auffallend. Dabei auch noch ganz leichte Röstmalzanklänge - in die Richtung eines wenig-süßen Malzbonbons gehen. Alkoholische Schärfe ist nur ganz leicht spürbar.  --> Ein sehr schöner, komplexer Doppelbock!

1231,"2010-11-29",3.9,"Fresh 2010 bomber.  The pour yields a dark, ruddy looking, deep burgundy to plummy-brown colored body.  A moderate, velvety-smooth head of beige foam settles to a thin blanket that lasts for the duration.  A wash of suds leaves behind some minimal, skinny lace flaring.  The nose is what doppelbock is all about, based in super rich, malty caramel, loaded with dark fruity elements, including plums, figs, dates, and raisins.  Those fruits are stewed down and reduced, but their collective sweetness is cut a bit by some chocolate malt roast and hints of toasted toffee.  Hints of citrusy and earthy hops play second fiddle, as they should, but they do bring a nice sense of balance to a beer that could have otherwise gone too far into saccharine territory.  Flavors continue the theme, again showing deliciously toasted caramel and toffee notes amidst hints of slightly chalky cocoa, dried plums, prunes, and caramelized dates.  A touch of brown sugar and some dark raisin for good measure round out the fruit profile.  Distant orange peel offers a touch of citrus-based oiliness, and some earth-borne hops add a touch of spicy bite and balance (though it remains largely malt driven and sweet).  The palate sports a smooth, creamy consistency that is supported by ultra-fine, active carbonation.  It drinks pretty easy for a 10% brew, though its ample substance leads in to a mildly sticky finish.  It could be much worse, however, as the carbonation dries things out fairly well.  Very good brew....bordering on excellent, and certainly top notch for the style.  Smuttynose continues on as one of the best, most consistent breweries across a wide variety of styles, yet they get very little pub.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

the nose is very malty and has notes of brown sugar, chocolate, a nuttiness which is not quite coffee-like, grassiness and some fruit... raisins and sweet cherries. 

the flavor reminds me of eating bananas and coffee with malted chocolate milk in it... malt powder, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, toasted nuts, molasses and floral alcohol which, to me, tastes like bananas... coffee is all over the aftertaste. 

the medium body has a creamy mouth feel, a pleasant acidity and sharpness. it is quite dry from the alcohol which also warms the belly. the sweetness does get bothersome toward the end of the glass... 7/4/7/4/14/3.6","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"

Pours a deep, slightly hazy amber with a big creamy tan head that sticks to the sides of the glass stubbornly and stays on as a cap for the duration.

The smell is dominated by sweet caramel malts and lots of dark fruits as well.  Theres also some citrus hop burn in the nostrils as well.

The taste is again dominated by the caramel malts with some molasses coating the mouth throughout.  The hops are present but very subtle in the taste.  There are raisins and figs before a sweet slick finish.

The mouthfeel is slick and sticky with the sweetness of malts and dark fruits.  The soft carbonation is very complimentary to the full bodied mouthfeel.

Sometimes after drinking this much of a single beer, something that was otherwise dull starts to shine, and complexities begin to reveal themselves. Other times, something that was OK at first starts getting really dull and tired, and one doesn’t even want to finish it. This beer is of the latter category. The aroma is vegetal, beety, some nyc street vendor potato knish, some white sugar. The flavor is sweet and syrupy, with a very thick body, but it is hard to enjoy it more than perhaps small quantities. This is a bit too much double of a doppelbock.

1231,"2006-10-02",4.2,"Clear bodied oranged brown with a good streaming of bubbles lasting within for a good portion of its sitting. Two finger high roofing of smoothed creamy light tanned froth is nailed to the top. Keeps a solid thick skim of foam always present once settled and the lacing is mostly keeping close to the liquid in a thin sheet of fine foam. Some spots are flecked about across the glass.

Aroma is fairly milding with moderate malt tones of toffee, maple, molasses, and a slight toastyness that adds a nice bready-like drying note.

Thick on malt, moderate to mild and flavor, not sinking or heavy, very even set and smooth with a well-rounded taste and warming. The taste is hard to pin down as its nature is alluringly complex and simple in tone, yet has an urging length and tiny shavings of things in it that makes for good lip smacking intersest. Toffee and caramel are at the center in a milding set girth with a super creamy surrounding of all sorts of notings of dark fruits; raisin, fig, and a slimming dark cherry edge. Slightly spiced with a greasy backed, oily hopping adding a slight herbalness within the malty warmth. More so entering into the finish. The unique thing I find about both its flavor and thickness is a small breadyness that has a nicely set toasted realm to its overall scale of malt. Its slight, but somehow always present. A dull set fruityness in a bigger figgy, molassas tone really tends to take over as it goes as the warmth never leaves nor does the nicely added hoping in the finish. This definately gerw on me as I went along to the point where I was fixating myself on what exactly was going on. A perplexing palate soothing softy of a brew. When taken in to account of its Doppelbock style that it. 

Feel is quite nice. Soft, yeilding, smooth, creamy, uncloying sideness and thickness. Big mediumness to full bodied on the palate. Not too heavy and definately not any heavier then need be. As it goes down pretty damn easy. The wamth is all malts and flavor and not just a bunch of heat. It sinks in like a good breakfast and soaks in like a hot suana. Gradually making its case for you to enjoy and continuing to enjoy,without much hassle to your palate.

A pleasurable beer for sure. Its abundant in complexing flavor and warmth all the while keeping a simple ease about it. How the hell they do it? I dont know, but damn if aint a solid Doppelbock and then some. Onward Smuttonator!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Smells strong. Theres a gentle alcohol smell with a big malt behind it. Smells like a barley wine. 

Tastes like a barley wine too! Ah, but theres the smoky sour kick that makes this a pretty tasty Doppelbock. The flavor is really well done; tasty and wholesome. In fact, its giving me some pretty intense flashbacks from Germany. It must be good.

1231,"2006-08-02",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2007 After sampling quite a few different Smuttynose beers during a recent NJ/PA vacation Ive become a big fan of this superb brewery . However, this offering left me a bit dissapointed. Pours a translucent brownish-ruby color with a thin, but lasting beige head. Aroma was pleasant revealing caramel candies, figs, dates, toasted malt and spices, but seemed a bit too reserved and faint. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin and watery I thought for a DB, probably as a result of the high alcohol level. Flavors mostly in line with the aromas but a bit more assertive; sweet caramel, dark fruits, toffee, toasted malts and a mild spiciness.  Finish was sweet and warm, but quick. Wasnt too thrilled with this one overall.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
1231,"2006-07-31",3.3,"Again,  not everything deserves to end in ""ator"" and not everything deserves to have a goat on the bottle.  This was a disappointment.

Taste of sweet malts and toffee, liglhtly hopped, but with nasty overtones of too much alcohol insufficiently masked and the bubble gum overtones of an unbalanced barleywine.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
1231,"2006-07-24",3.5,"I was all in the mood to be smuttonated, but as I sat waiting the sensation that I had expected to be overwhelming simply crept up, tapped me on the lips and slowly slanked away. This may be an unfair assessment as it was actually far above fair, but dang blast it I blame Smuttynose themselves for making other beers I like a lot. I do hope they play with the recipe a bit as its not all too far away from being a beer I would like a lot and they could do it in two divergent possibilities - either make mmore malty or head own the hop highway.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"

1231,"2006-06-11",3.1,"Too strong for a maibock, not enough color and body for a doppelbock. A miss on any bock style. Pour was copper colored, weak head and little to no lacing. Aroma was there for a doppel bock, lots of dark fruits (figs and raisins), but also some pilsner grassy hops. The flavor was light and grassy to go along with some fruity flavors and caramel malts, but the dark fruits werent there. An extra touch of hops in the finish to keep this thing honest, but too hoppy (maybe it was pepper as others have noted) relative to the rich hoppiness of other doppelbocks. Cant accuse this of being too malty and sweet, but it was perhaps too hoppy and bitter. No bread or dough. Maybe I shall dub this an imperial maibock anyway - not a good style. Mouthfeel was somewhat syrup-like and about right for the style.","","User37895"
1231,"2006-06-04",3.5,"2004 bottle date, Sampled June 2006
Pours with a rich, dark amber brown color which shows a brilliantly clear ruby hue when held up to the light.  The beer has a frothy full tan colored head that slowly dissipates back into the beer.  Ah the aroma is rich and malty; a mix of concentrated notes of prunes and raisins, but not sweet, chewy with a note similar to fresh malt extract and a sort of meaty quality.  After a bit of time it begins to pick up some sweetness, which accentuates the fruit character a bit.  The aroma is really nice, purely malt driven with perhaps a hint of oxidation, which only adds to the richness.

The taste is sweet up front, and in fact sweet throughout.  There is a light spiciness here in the middle; it is a bit like clove or allspice, but not really.  The beer is rich and a bit palate coating bit still not overly so.  This beer is quit drinkable, it just seems to disappear from my glass.  There are some notes of rum here, combined with the malt, which makes this a sweet, yet rich tipple.  Notes of chewy, freshly toasted malt.  Hints of cherry and perhaps a round note of raisins.

This beer is very drinkable, even enjoyable but it seems to be lacking a richness and complexity that I would expect in a great doppelbock.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Flavors of vanilla, maple syrup, caramel, and roasty, delicious malt.  Although most here seem to think alcohol is light, i find it to be a very noticeable flavor element.

Very roasty and buttery in the mouth, like any good doppel should be.  Despite the high ABV, you dont really taste it, its nicely masked.  Starts off bitter and roasty.

The beer is just slightly sweet, though far less so than many others of this style with a healthy dose of hops providing harmony between malt, sugars, and alcohol.

The smell of this beer seems off to me, more of a grape sour smell comes out which throws me off a bit. As I continue to smell this beer more candied darker fruit begins to rise from the depths which now intrigues me.

Alcohol warmth is not harsh in any way. An outstanding beer, I always look forward to this release.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","BitchesBrew"

1231,"2005-07-26",4.8,"As soon as I popped the cap, emitting the slightest of carbonation hisses, I knew this could be great.  Poured a nice rosy mahogany color with some tan bubbles along the edges and bubbly cloisters scattered intermittently on the surface.  Smells oh so good.  Rich, vibrant caramel, chocolatey and a little smoke on the backend paired with some toasty pecans.  Rich and sweet all over.  Flavor?  Yes.  This one gives an all-out one-two punch.  Velvety, solidified chocolatey caramel rolls in, resonating with an unparalleled richness, reminiscent of Rolos.  Some pecan casings and hazelnuts for robust dimension, and a soothing vanilla crème current underneath it all.  Woodsy-cedar backdrop to an ever present caramel decadence, transitioning to hints of amaretto in the aftertaste.So full-bodied its ridiculous.  Slowly seeps in and accentuates every nuance in its wake.  Balance has never been better.  Daunting, chewy and impressive malt complexity.  Carbonation is so toned down and at most preferable levels, and the noble hopping has never been more regal.  Finishes like white chocolate covered cashews.  Im so happy I drank this beer.

Med/full body, silky smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol up front, cherries, bready malts and a faint roastiness top it off. Finish is medium dry with some warming alc. heat FO SHO!  Needs to lay down fer awhile?? Still an interesting ride though. Again, Again!!","Ceciltucky, Co., Maryland, USA","sloth"
1231,"2005-01-25",3.5,"On draught January 2005 at Redbones.  Delightful color to this, reds, golds, oranges and coppers all mix to form a brilliant, deep, colorful body.  Small light beige head.  Aroma of German yeast, smooth hops and sweet caramel and toffee.  Very sweet up front, with apparent hops quickly coming to balance.  Remains mostly sweet however, with a tingly, strong carbonation to it and a medium-full body.  Brandy soaked fruit, bittersweet yeast and orange citrus flavors all come in to play.  Ends on a candied orange note with some lightly sticky caramel lurking.  I dont like what they did with the hops here, this dosent seem very traditional.  Call me old fashioned, but Id like a whole lot less in the way of citric hops and bitterness.  Little to any chocolate and not nearly as much yeast flavor as I would like.  That being said, I will give it points for potential, as Im sure this stuff will age gracefully; it should lose a lot of the annoying carbonation, the hops should die down and perhaps some earthy yeast tones will emerge.  Will be back in a year.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1231,"2005-01-25",4.0,"On tap at Andys. Deep red in color with a nice tan head. Huge malty aroma with a nice touch of alcohol. Flavor is malty and smooth. Full bodied. Enjoyable beer. Thick body and palate.  Nice beer.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
1231,"2005-01-25",3.5,"22 oz. bottle.  Pours an amber color with thick fluffy tan head.  Aroma is sweet, spicy, malty and bready.  I smell bananas, sugar and caramel.  Complex to say the least.  Taste begins malty, sweet and sugary and finishes with bitter hops.  Hops and alcohol dominate the taste.  Rich and smooth.  Done well but I dont care for the strong alcohol taste.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"
1231,"2005-01-23",3.4,"Big head and nice lacing on this beer, but its color is flat brown without much glow.  The nose is hard to pin down:  I get orange and nectarine mingling with vanilla.  The hops are appropriately sweet in the beer, which is smooth and rich.  The mouthfeel is light, and the finish a little bitter.  The yeast is a constant player in the nose, flavor, and mouthfeel, but there is nothing exceptional about it.  Overall, I would consider this a good ""food"" beer, because it will not overpower any dish you might serve with it.  By itself, an average contribution.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"
1231,"2005-01-23",3.5,"Pours a lucid garnet with a sizeable tan head.  Aroma is heavily malt with notes of caramel and butterscotch.  Flavor is heavy on the alcohol but smooth, not surprisingly dominated by a bready, yeasty maltiness.  Finish seems lacking in a way, though I cant place it.  Nonetheless, its good.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"
1231,"2005-01-22",4.0,"Tap at Andys. Reddis brown, cllear, tan head. Aroma is of huge malt, mixed with a touch of Sulfur and alcohol. Big malty flavor, and very smooth. Thick body, but very easy to drink. Well done for such a massive brew.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
1231,"2005-01-21",3.9,"On tap.  Deep brown color with some nice red when held up to a light.  Aroma is sweet caramel malts and alcohol.  Taste is very smooth and sweet with raisons, fig, candy sugar, and spice.  Good tasting beer but I would like it a bit less sweet alcohol in the finish.","Amherst, Massachusetts, USA","ukoolaid"
1231,"2005-01-20",4.2,"I always look forward to the release of a new Smuttynose ""Big Beer,"" but was saddened to see that they had gone with a doppelbock.  I dont normally go for this style.  But I decided to throw caution and good prudence to the wind and try it anyway.  Good decision, as I found myself actually enjoying this beer immensely.  Deep brown, touch of ruby, creamy head.  Big cola nose with a splash of cherry and bitter apricot pits.  Warming malt, with a note of molasses and caramel.  The pleasant surprise was the balancing hops, providing a bracing shot of bitterness to keep things tied together.  Also found notes of cherry, spice, raisins, and pepper.  Warming alcohol.  Really a complex, excellent beer.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1231,"2005-01-17",4.3,"Bottle. A real whopper of a  dopplebock, thats for sure. I am loving Smuttynose more with each and every new beer of theirs I drink. In fact, the bottle lets you know what year it was made and informs you that its bottle conditioned. What a novel approach. Now if everyone else would do this, I would be in heaven. This stuff whacks ya right in the nose with bourbon, malt and ripe cherries. The taste has the most fantastic blend of roasted malts follwed with a nice alcohol kick in the ass. This shit is awesome and will probably do nothing but get better. Hats off to Smuttynose again. Thanks","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1231,"2005-01-17",4.0,"Bottle. Copper body with splashes of ruby. Small tan head. Nose is sweet with fruit (could swear I smell bananas), caramel, light hops, and big malt. Taste is very sweet but has a nice hop backbone to balance it. Light spice, caramel, big fruit notes, and alcohol. Body has a pleasant warming feel to it. Nice carbonation feel as well - not overdone. Theres a creaminess that I appreciate. Finishes with more sweet malts, spice, alcohol, fruit notes and caramel. BIG doppelbock and a nice beer!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1231,"2005-01-16",3.7,"Clear dark copper with a fluffy tan coallpsing head, nice glass lace. Cool label. The aroma is light raisins, light sweet caramel, and some definite hop presence. The flavor is  spicy and sweet malt, warming alcohol, and a good dose of bitter hoppiness. The body is medium (needs to be a bit fuller), carbonation is lively on the palate. Much hoppier than a typical dopplebock. Overall I like it but the carbonation works against the high alcohol percent on the palate. Interesting for sure.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
1231,"2005-01-14",3.1,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2005 Poured a ruby red, caramel color with an off white head that quickly disappeared leaving no lacing on the glass.  Aroma of nuts, smoked peat, raisins, light roast, sweet caramel, and alcohol in the aroma.  Light roast and caramel, dominated by peppery alcohol, and nuts.  Even after a year, I find this a bit hot.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"

Hoppier than your average dopplebock.Smutty delivers the goods(no surprise here) Keep up the great work Dave Y and co.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","happy4hops"
1231,"2005-01-11",3.0,"22 oz. brown bomber bottle. $3.75 each at a local watering hole. No freshness date seen. Slight pfftt when opened. Poured out a deep caramel color, with certain red highlights. Decent, thick, tan colored head, & it had plenty of staying power.
Flavors are of sweet caramel malts, some molasses, pilsener malt backbone.
Alcohol is well hidden, almost unnoticeable. Slightly warming to the stomach when swallowed, but nothing like a 9.6% beer. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced between the malts & hops. A decent effort on the style overall.","","Cobra"
1231,"2005-01-11",4.2,"22oz bottle. My second double bock (Troegs Troegenator) Pours ruby red body with a lasting milky head.  Aroma is very complex, but definite sweet malts, chocolate, caramel and very fruity.  Notice the alcohol on the nose. Hoppy too!! Body is rich, syrupy and smooth.  Ide say without question, one of Smuttys finest offerings.","Street, Maryland, USA","NDM84"

1231,"2005-01-10",3.9,"22oz bottle: Beautiful deep ruby amber body with a medium, thick & creamy tan head that lasts.  Medium bodied with silky carbonation.  Aroma: mild alcohol notes, berries, backed by some hints of malt, pear, chocolate, cherries, raspberries, maple sugar, and spiced honey notes as it warms.  Taste: Initially very sweet & syrupy with carbonation that tingles the tongue.  Towards the middle I get notes of berries, light apple/alcohol, pear, toasted grains, biscuit, mild bitter chocolate, pepper, spicy yeast, tea, citrus.  Finishes slick and syrupy in my mouth with mildly sweet berry, sweet citrus, and honey coated biscuits.  Sediment noted on the bottom of the bottle, but none in my glass even without decanting.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
