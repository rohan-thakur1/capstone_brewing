1822,"2016-12-09",4.0,"Bottle from the brewery. Pours dark brown with a bubbly, frothy beige head. Tastes like chocolate malt, burnt toast, roasted coffee, and creamy with a hint of dried fruits.

1822,"2016-08-25",3.9,"August 25th, 2014 - Uintas looks like beef in a bottle. As I pour it, I accidentally utter ""Oof, this looks beefy"", both a comment on its muscular stature and the dark, brown color of the body and the slightly lighter color of the head. The aroma is extra creamy, giving off hints of steak sauce and soy sauce (notably, not teriyaki sauce), with hazelnut and nutella for sweetness. I go in again once the foam settles, but catch mostly the same, though richer, and clearer. I deliberately served it on the warmer side, which allows the flavor to deploy into action immediately. The alcohol burns bright, but settles once the hazelnut flavor comes into play. I also catch the flavor of virginia pipe tobacco, and in the aftertaste, a long, deep, festive flavor of roasted chestnut. Its a heavy beer, and definitely on the boozy side, which detracts from some of the potential for complexity, but some reappears near the bottom of the glass. The aftertaste adds some licorice and anise, a nice spicy finish, and a clean way to end a powerful, potent beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Taste: Deep, rich toasty chocolate, molasses, and vanilla up front, giving way to a pleasantly light roast character and sharp but not overpowering hop bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Moderate body, with light carbonation, and a warming alcohol bite on the back end. 
Finish: Bitterness and roast helps balance the strong sweetness of this beer, with a lingering chocolate and roast character. 
Overall: Really pleasantly surprised that the bourbon barrel aging added complimentary flavors instead of overpowering. Vanilla flavors help balance the chocolate and roast. Chocolate malt dominates the flavor profile as it should. Walks a fine line compared to an imperial stout, but this fits the style. Well done.","","TH28"

Theres a nice licorice bite and an acrid burnt bitterness that balances out a mild sugary vanilla sweetness. The body is appropriately on the thin side with a bit of creaminess around the edges. The dry bitterness lays down on the tongue and stays there but not in an overwhelming way. The 8% ABV here is almost completely hidden which makes this dangerous.

5.0 S: This has a world class nose. Powerful, complex, and well integrated. Moderate roastiness, but overall is quite sweet. Tons of tangy molasses with layers of chocolate and caramel. Hints of coffee and fig. I didnt list a lot of descriptors, but what I did list runs deep. 

4.25 T: The taste is very good, but cant compare with the nose. Layers of chocolate and caramel, moderate roastiness. Fig and maybe some currant and prune fruitiness. Like the nose, molasses is the focus.

4.5 M: Heavier medium to heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Creamy with a slippery velvet texture. Super smooth.

4.5 D: Really great brew. Buy it for the taste, love it for the nose. This reminds me a good deal of Marshal Zhukov, which I adore.

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a deep brown color with a one half inch tan head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave lots of lacing on the sides of the glass. 

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of a roasted malt smell mixed with nice aromas of chocolate and coffee. Along with these darker aromas are some notes of a caramel sweetness mixed with a little bit of a vanilla and an oaky smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with roasted malt taste mixed with some sweeter tastes of caramel and a bit of light vanilla upfront. A light chocolate flavor quickly comes to the tongue with an oaky taste soon following mid way through the taste. The caramel sweetness dwindles more toward the end with the overall flavor of the brew drying out a bit as some roasted coffee and a more dark chocolate like flavor grow stronger. In the end, the roasted characteristics of the brew stand out rather well, leaving a dry and roasty flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the average side with a carbonation level that is rather average to slightly above average producing a very easy drinking brew, although it may possibly be a little light for accentuating the darker flavors of the brew.

 Overall  A tasty and very easy drinking brew. There is almost no detectable alcohol taste even at 8 % abv. The nice roasted malt and drier finish of the brew make this one a quite delicious and a dangerous brew. Quite nice.","","Darkmagus82"

Nose is lush caramel and a fainter molasses. Coffee, chocolate and roasty malt. A sultry whiff of sweet bourbon and a bit of vanilla. The malt is earthy and fragrant. Some elusive dark fruits seem to flash and fade but the one that lasts is a alight plum. 



Taste is dry roasty malt with its sweet underpinnings. washes over the palate with a surprising milky sweetness. Strong bitter coffee, dry bittersweet chocolate, subtle vanilla and tempting bourbon. There is a wood so light on this that it seems to be literally afloat, weightless on the beer.

1822,"2014-08-03",3.8,"Pours an opaque beautiful black with abundant toffee head that laces nicely.

Aroma is mostly toffee with some chocolate that comes out more as the brew approaches room temperature.

Brew is a clean chocolate and coffee, with mild bitterness on the tip of the tongue yielding to the more roasted character as it clears the mouth. 

In all, a bold and respectable showing which, while not delivering much in the way of interest delivers as a strong porter.

Aroma is sweet caramel, light earthy burnt toast, light vanilla. Body is medium with a light frothiness. Flavor is not as sweet as the aroma would suggest; vanilla notes are stronger than anticipated resulting in the perception of sweeter malt. In actuality, the malt is rather dry, considerable burnt notes with some coffee.

Bottled On: 11/21/12.

Appearance: Pours an onyx black body with an initially tall, tan head, though it collapses fairly soon.

Smell: Fudge, carob chips, flecks of charred malt. Then, some vanilla and oak from the barrel. Light, leafy touch from the hops. Hint of foiled dark fruits, a bit of musty, funkiness cut from razor thin sniffs of alcohol.

Taste: Bittersweet chocolate, carob, and some slightly burnt malt hinting at espresso start. Medium-light sweetness. Slight, somewhat subtle vanilla and oaken elements from the barrel treatment. Theres a very, very light but noticeable funkiness for me, giving it a faintly sourish backing. Soiled dark fruitiness. Mild hop character, very low bitterness. Warming, chary, chocolaty finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation, initially. Smooth, as it glides across the tongue, but theres ample suds all the same (initially, at least).

Overall: A decent sipper. I think I like it. I think?","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Really hard to get past the terrible malt...very raw/worty/vegetal.  There are some nice elements behind that struggling for your attention, but they cant compete.

1822,"2013-01-27",2.2,"Almost-opaque black. Persistent mocha froth holds beautifully. Very sweet nose of wort, paint, soy sauce, cola, lactose, overripe plums, and stewed black cherries. Suggestive butter toffee, vanilla taffy, coconut, and licorice. Some vegetal notes poking through, as well. Snug but fuzzy carbonation. Initially tangy with metallic malt coupling with overripe plum sweetness and cooked tomatoes. Quite worty, and severely dull, consequently, as soggy, day-old breakfast cereal blends with flabby sugars to render any vivid malt remnants utterly lifeless. Worty to the point of resembling dog food, as well. Medicinal effect is apparent from the combination of higher alcohols and pervasive overripe dark fruits. Dusting of tannins gently brush the tongue, but quickly give way to a scorched wood and stale coffee grounds huskiness. Severely muddled, throughout. Finishes perpetually sugar-laden and unfinished, with a profound absence of malt definition and sturdiness of structure. A clear miss for Uinta, as this is quite the sugar and soy sauce bomb, with a host of other flaws piled on for good measure. Almost too undrinkable to analyze.

Soft warmth as well. Ends with more chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, light booze, vanilla, and light coffee. Tasty!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1822,"2013-01-17",4.2,"On tap @ Public House in Vegas. Very dark brown with mahogany highlights. Meaty broth malty nose with seductive bourbon sweetness. The palate opens sweeter than expected, given the nose: vanilla, light smoke, sweet figs, molasses, bread crusts. Made me pay attention in a good way! Awesome!","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
1822,"2013-01-15",4.1,"750 c&c from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Cork print is ""Earth, Wind and Beer"". Pours a nice dark brown with a 4 finger creamy darkish tan head. Aroma of very smooth dark malt with very subtle, but strong, darkish fruit. I keep thinking bourbon, then I read the description. So. Bourbon. Full bodied. Flavor is very bourbon/vanilla with lots of dark fruit and something that makes me think of the old, dry gingerbread crackers. Meanwhile the head is collapsing into degenerate, random lacing.  Its not exactly dry, but the various flavors tend to hide the malty sweetness. OMFG. JTDC. My head is expanding exponentially.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1822,"2013-01-12",3.8,"750 ml bottle to oversized snifter (shared with the Mrs.; thanks douglas88).  Looks good; black with foamy beige head.  Smells of semi-sweet malt and booze with some bitterness.  Tastes like it smells, only better, with notes of chocolate.  Good on the palate.  Good stuff!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1822,"2013-01-11",3.9,"750ml bottle, shared. Black color, good thin light brown head, leaves great full lace. Some chocolate, toasted malts, maybe some tobacco in the nose. Lightly smokey, toasty flavor. Again with the herbal, and tobacco notes. A bit less heavy on the dark fruit than other baltic porters can be, and I personally prefer that. Good roasty malts, solid bitterness, light sweet. Nice roasty chocolate aftertaste, just a hint of dark fruit, good light bit of smoke. Bigger body, smooth lighter carbonation, dry finish. Influence from bourbon barrel is subtle - not immediately obvious, but vanilla and wood flavors are noticeable. though no boozy heat. A nice balance. I think this is well done.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1822,"2013-01-10",3.7,"From a bottle poured a dark brown color with a small amount of head.  Strong sweet malty flavor with a lasting finish.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","jeremytoni"
1822,"2013-01-09",3.1,"Appearance from the tap is immaculate.  Rich creamy head that lingers. Mild aroma. Good porter taste. Not too overpowering of any one kind of flavor.

1822,"2013-01-05",4.0,"Bottle @ The BeerMongers on New Years Eve...  Poured deep, jet black with a easy forming, eggy, off-white head.  A nice drinking Baltic Porter.  Smooth, clean, well rounded.  Not too cloying or thick of a mouthfeel.  Nice notes of cherries and other dark fruits with vanilla, worty malts, caramel cream, and a faint oak booziness.  Not too oaky or woody.  Definitely seemed to have been blended out a bit.  A great beer.  If it was about $2-3 cheaper it would make for a great buy.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
1822,"2013-01-04",4.0,"Big bottle. Pours a thick black color with a thick tan head on it. I found it slightly bitter with just a hint of roasting in there. The feel of it was a tad harsh, but it was a very interesting drink.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
1822,"2013-01-01",4.0,"Bottle. Colour...basically black with a thick tan head. Nose...oak, vanillin, toffee. Palate...creamy though not esp thick. Lots of oak and some smoke with an ashen/char aspect that exists throughout the palate. Theres plenty of chocolate, as well, but in a subdued manner that just happens to be omnipresent through the experience.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
1822,"2012-12-31",4.0,"750 ml, corked and caged. Cool label. Pours a pitch black color with a medium, very creamy brown head. An interesting nose of bourbon, roast, metallic notes, anise. The flavor is great: sweet vanilla, bourbon, roast, mellow fruit, a gentle creamy palate. Coca. A bit of cola in the finish and more vanilla. Very decadent. Awesome. The palate is amazing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
