412,"2017-06-16",3.3,"Tiny bit of sugar and cinnamon in aroma and taste. Dark clear golden. Thicker palate.Not overly creamy, but sugary. Tap at brewery.","norristown, Pennsylvania, USA","katrinaez"
412,"2017-06-10",3.6,"Crowler thanks to Chow. Pours a hazy copper gold with small white head that lasts. The aroma is strong cream of wheat, cinnamon, toasted malt. Medium body, spice, toasted malt, cream, light finish, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
412,"2016-11-21",3.2,"Draft. Amber beer with a cream head. Light cinnamon and light hay aroma. Cinnamon and light sweet malt flavor with light breadiness. Medium bodied. Cinnamon and light sweet malt lingers.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
412,"2016-10-12",3.4,"On tap at Fieldwork Sacramento. Pours amber gold with a nice off-white head and a cinnabon aroma. There is a smooth amber malt flavor with a perfumy cinnamon finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
412,"2016-10-08",3.5,"Clear dark amber pour with a slight white head. Lots of cinnamon on the nose. Nice light body, easily drinkable, just a little malty on the finish. Cool beer.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
412,"2016-08-03",3.5,"On tap @ Fieldwork. Clear golden beer with some white foam. Mostly just cinnamon and vanilla here, which I guess is what they were going for and what you would expect. Its enjoyable enough, certainly, though I dont think Id care to drink more than my taster pour...kind of analogous to the Bruerys Or Xata beer. Some cream soda, dough, bread, and cinnamon sugar. Its certainly as advertised and fine enough.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
412,"2016-08-02",3.8,"Tap at Ale Arsenal as part of the SVBW event. I really enjoyed this as it had more pronounced ""churro"" aspects than I would have expected. It really picked up the cinnamon and sugar nicely and provided solid rounded malt in support. A nice surprise (to the extent I can be surprised anymore by a Fieldwork beer being very good).","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"
412,"2016-07-22",3.6,"Basically just tastes like a beer version of a churro. But I agree with PhillyCraft that it is pretty ""Banging for a gimmicky beer.""","","digitalviking"
412,"2016-07-09",3.0,"On tap at the brewery. Everyone seems to like this beer except for me. It pours a clear golden color with an off white head. I couldve sworn that I picked up some weird mandarin orange and lime in the aroma along with some rather strong cinnamon. Seemed out of place. Bready malt backbone. Mostly cinnamon and bready malt in the flavor, but I still couldnt shake the citrusy fruitiness. Weird. Kind of a fizzy mouthfeel too. I asked if there could be some cross contamination with another beer, and the staff confirmed there wasnt.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
412,"2016-07-03",4.1,"On tap, this beer pours hazy orange with small white top. Smell is really heavy on nutmeg, and pumpkin type spice. Flavor actually nailed a churro. It has cinnamon, vanilla bean, and even a fried dough aftertaste. Wow, so much better than carton cafe y churro. Medium in body. So Banging for a gimicky beer","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
412,"2016-06-27",3.8,"On tap at Fieldwork. Generally a boring style to me, but this vanilla and cinnamon version really works. Great nose and flavor, as it really does taste like its name sake, and that goes for the malt profile, too. Well done! After this and ballast points coffee cream ale, I may never drink another ""normal"" one again.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
