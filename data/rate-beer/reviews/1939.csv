1939,"2016-10-19",3.3,"11.2 oz. bottle from Louisville Beer Store; shared with Boo. Aroma: Big, rich cocoa notes with a not negligible amount of soy sauce, lighter woody hints around the periphery; missing some of the fruitier aspects I enjoy in other foreign stouts. Appearance: Inky black pour with a bubbly, dark mocha head that settles into a thin ring. Flavor: Dark chocolate- and somewhat lesser soy sauce- rule, but are met at the start by lactose; woody notes linger on at the finish, which is about as dry as youd expect a sweeter stout to get. Palate: Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, long finish. Overall: Definitely one that gave me reservations at the start, but this worked out well in the end.

1939,"2016-02-28",3.7,"12 oz bottle enjoyed with ebone1988 and his bottle. The pour is a lighter black with a thin bubbly collar of dark khaki colored head and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is initially a lot of chocolate. There is a bit of bready cake going on as well as a ton of roast. There is a little woodiness happening as well which is nice. It's not overly complex, and there is a little metallic on the finish, but it's not terrible. The flavor is pretty much all roast. There is a light creaminess and a hint of smoke that pokes through. No cocoa, and there's a light lactose happening on the back end. The mouth feel is pretty damn good. It's thick and viscous with an awesome creamy soft carbonation. There is a lingeringly roasty aftertaste with just a hint of chocolate milk. Not too bad.

Arôme met de suite laccent sur les notes douces du lactose. Ces dernières sont ponctuées par le bouquet distinct, mais timide, du cèdre qui apporte des effluves épicées et boisées. Ayant Cigar City comme exemple, le cèdre reste plus mitigé dans son usage. La malt chocolaté et le cacao arrivent à percer en rétro.
Palais est profond au niveau malté avec un fini sec au palais attirant lattention sur leffet boisé du cèdre. Ce dernier reste présent tout en étant un peu plus discret dans sa complexité. On retrouve un fini épicé lié au boisé typique du cèdre. Le chocolat est également présent avec une petite note amer sur la fin.

1939,"2015-01-11",4.0,"Poured from a bottle (Best Before 31 December 2014) into a teku glass. Pours coffee black with a thin but somewhat generous coffee brown head. 

A lot of the cacao and cypress wood on the nose. Not so much the lactose. Also a good amount of roast malts.  Upon warming up a lot of the tropical fruits such as  passion fruit.

The palate is medium bodied but quite foamy. The attack is very cacao/dark chocolate forward. A slight tartness and sweetness from the milk sugar also becomes very apparent. Just a slight coffee bitterness in the middle but overall, a very easy drinking stout. The darkness of the chocolate is balanced by the brighter flavors of the milk sugar. Tropical fruit flavors also appear a lot more upon warming up. In general, the flavors are not very intense as expected from this style.

Medium bodied, smooth and olily on the palate, a pleasure to imbibe.
Solid stout, lots of depth and flavour in this one.

Flavour so chocolate, thick, vanilla, coats the tongue with oily silk indulgence. Heavily burnt flavours at the end which in a long drawn out way balance the initial sweetness.

La lupulización agradable, la justa para equilibrar el dulzor, queda reforzada por amargor de cacao negro y permanece en el final dulce. Leves notas de mermelada de ciruela en el retrogusto.
