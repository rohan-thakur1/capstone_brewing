The flavor is super tart and sour with the hibiscus and cinnamon spice playing a much lighter part, with some caramel barrel, and the same very ripe peach from the nose lightly lingering.

3143,"2014-06-23",4.1,"375mL bottle. 
Aroma is interesting with a surprisingly noticeable cinnamon character, moderately hibiscus and light acidity and citrus. Light whiskey and oak notes. 
Pours a fairly clear, deep reddish amber with some ruby notes and a medium sized, moderately thick, light tan head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers. Moderate lacing and small legs. 
Flavor has a medium light acidity with some nice citrus character. Moderate hibiscus and floral esters with some faint cinnamon spice. Really nice tart berry and cherry fruit notes with light oak and faint whiskey in the finish. As it warms you pick up a bit more cinnamon, but it is still very much a background character. Lingering acidity and hibiscus.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this is a pretty good beer. Nice, balanced acidity with quite a bit of hibiscus. Cinnamon makes a nice background character as does the barrel treatment.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3143,"2014-05-21",4.1,"Pours a vibrant berry red, nearing magenta. Somewhat cloudy. Small off white head. After a minute or two, only a ring of bubbles with wisps across the surface remain. The aroma is a fruity mix of flavors. Theres hibiscus along with blackberries, raspberries, lemons, apples and a fruity floral quality, not quite sure what to call it. Im a little surprised to pick up some of the cinnamon, kinda expected it to have faded or dominated by the other flavors. Mild whiskey note. Some oak. The barrel mostly seems to contribute some fairly strong vanilla. The hibiscus/berries still are in control, but the vanilla adds some good sweetness. The taste is medium sour. Starts with berry and vanilla sweetness, before tarter berries and lemons take over. Oak in the finish. Not much funk but its there a bit. Sourness seem mostly lactic. Overall, its quite dry. Fairly effervescent at first, but it settles pretty quickly. Pretty light on the palate. Lingering lactic aftertaste with a medium pucker. Very good beer.

Understated spiced or cinnamon presence (almost none at all). Lots of sour lacto yeast with each sip; lemon flesh, peach, mild vinous character. Vibrant & tart! Some drying oak with hints of whiskey lead into a lightly tannic, heavily lactic finish with tart fruit & a bit of acidity. Light & sharp mouth feel with a dryness that pulls back the gum line.

3143,"2013-07-06",4.1,"375 ml bottle from my 2013 Crooked Stave Membership. Kudos to Aaron, my neate trustee. Pours a rich reddish crimson hue, good haziness, berry hues and red wine, fruity and crimson elements. Frothy whitish head atop stays as a filmy layer, laces ok. Aromas are a potent sour kick, wet oak and hibsicus, red berry shows some pulpy raspberry, red wine and wet oak. A bit of vanilla, lactic acidity and lemons, yogurt. Gentle spice, more hibiscus, sourness and oak. Some sour apple, gentle peach, fruity melange. The fruit whiskey elements here are more sour fruit and synergistic as opposed to that Surette version where it was firmer whiskey/vanilla. Decent brett, cobwebs, and a more lactic and sour feel overall. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, firm sourness but not acedic, hibiscus tartness, a bit of red wine, mellow raspberry and pulpy berry. Wet oak, lactic elements and yogurt, touch of vanilla. Tart apple, peach elements, wet oak and vanilla whiskey element is much more subtle up front, tapering off with no real heat. Middle is tart, fruity, and hibiscus driven. Yogurt, oak, and firmer brett, a bit of spice, faint cinnamon in gentle jabs. Dry brett, funk, a bit of estery and tart fruit as we move on. Backend is more tart/sour driven, hibiscus, bit of raspberry and gentle red grape. Lactic, yogurt, lingering brett. Tart and a bit more dry as we finish up, lingering oak and lactic qualities. Overall, really tasty and too drinkable. Nothing acedic, that hibiscus element is quite enjoyable, sustains and remains in the driver seat. Firm lactic element, touch of berry compliments well. The fruit from the whiskey elements is nice as well and this one doesnt get that interfering vanilla and whiskey flavor. Quite a nice beer here. A winner from the 2013 line.

Nose of hibiscus, light cinnamon, raspberry, wet wood, slight hints of whiskey, perhaps some of the peach is left also, tart. Taste is so much better than the nose, very tart raspberry, whiskey, vanilla, light cinnamon, other berries, not acidic in the least just berry tartness, really nice barrel flavor, and the balance on the finish between tartness, sweetness and dryness is about perfect.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

Upping my score from 3.8 to 4.1 Billowing aroma, delicately balanced.  This is phenomenal.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

Floral, hibiscus, tea, cinnamon, appley, nutmeg, and tangy smell - really different/weird aroma. Taste is hibiscus, honey, lactic acid, light vanilla, big spice, cherry, tannin, woody, and tart fruits. Light body with soft carbonation. Well-balanced and super easy-to-drink.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
