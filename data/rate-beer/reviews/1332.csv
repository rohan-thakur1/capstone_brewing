1332,"2011-07-22",3.3,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2011 On tap at Dragonmead; pour is frothy beige, with both fine and large bubbled character present. This brew retains fairly well. On the nose; caramel malt sweetness, coupled with smoke and dark fruit. On the tongue; there is a bitterness present. Its sweet and smoky, and fruity as well. Its also a bit light bodied, in a negative way. Plums, caramel, peat, and english hops sums it up","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
