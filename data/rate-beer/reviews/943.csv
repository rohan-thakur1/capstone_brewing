943,"2015-06-28",3.4,"Bright, clear light amber, small white head. Toasty/cereal. Little fruity. Light hoppy. Low bitterness. Light and easy to drink, but still plenty flavor. A hot weather refresher. Id have another.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
943,"2015-06-28",3.3,"Light sweet malty aroma. some light spices, sweet citrus. Taste is decent but not as enjoyable as aroma. A little too bitter, sweet, malty, rough to me. But a decent beer overall for sure","Wisconsin, USA","MarinEvelyn"
943,"2014-02-21",3.2,"Bottle - Grains and light grassy hops. Clear gold with a decent beige head. Grains and a quick hit of bitterness and a toasted malt finish. Nice for a California Common.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"

943,"2013-07-04",3.0,"Bottle; poured a dull amber color. Aroma of fruit punch; surprising aroma. Very fruity for the style; almost like a fruit juice, watered down. A bit of a miss for me.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
943,"2013-06-22",3.4,"Nice head, amber color, clear. Strong bitter aroma, with some alcoholic warmth and malt presence. Nice medium burnt taste, malty and a tiny bit floral, I liked it pretty well, Id definitely order again. A different but enjoyable seasonal.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Caytinator"
943,"2013-05-05",3.7,"Bottle. Probably the best steam beer Ive had. Light, crisp, rich cereal grains, full flavored. Very well made.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
943,"2013-04-24",4.1,"Steam beer, ala Anchor. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but prefer this toAnchor Steam. Slightly nutty aroma with a light brown clear pour. Hoppy maltiness befitting of the style. A good summery session brew when you want taste but not heaviness.
