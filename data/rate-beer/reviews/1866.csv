1866,"2014-12-24",3.2,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear gold with a medium sized white head. Sweet and floral, apple and something weird. Medium bodied, sweet and floral. Grainy with some yeast esters. Softly sweet finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
1866,"2010-12-14",3.9,"I caught this in their last batch right before Memorial Day Weekend. Unreal!","Levittown, New York, USA","TomTiedemann"
1866,"2009-06-12",3.7,"On tap at Black Forest.  Served in a frosted mug :(  Pours a hazy gold with a moderate white head that lasts until mid-glass and leaves a thick line of foam with each sip.  Pleasant aroma of malt along with just a hint of citrus.  The flavor is filled with lots of bready malt with some mild bitterness at the finish.  The mouthfeel is fairly creamy and is fairly lush actually.  A very good maibock.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
1866,"2009-05-10",3.7,"Tap at BF. Aroma of pale malts, slight grassy/herbal notes. Flavor sweet, bready malts with a fairly assertive grassy/floral hop character, particularly in the finish. Also quite lemony, as Im finding many BF beers to be. Very drinkable and enjoyable, just not too exciting.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
1866,"2009-05-10",3.6,"The aroma is biscuits and butter, sweet caramel, fruit, malty.  More or less true to the style.  The appearance is a yellow/amber color, white head.  the flavor closely follows the aroma, except I really get the biscuit/butter thing more clearly.  Sweet, fruity.  The finish is lightly hopped, and a little fruity sweet.  Nice beer overall.  Not a classic for this style, but very respectable.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
1866,"2009-05-10",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub.  Pours a semi-clear orange with a thick off-white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of sweet malt and tangy citrus.  Flavor of pale malts, wheat/bread dough, lemon, and tropical fruits, with a sweet finish.  Very nice actually and super drinkable.

1866,"2008-05-31",3.2,"Tap at the brewpub.  Hazy golden amber, creamy white head.  Aroma is lightly peppery and malty.  Light crackery malts with a touch of pale maltiness.  Warming feeling, lightly boozy but fairly clean.  As it warms, I get more booziness, but some light breadiness as well.  Its authentic, but still only average.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1866,"2008-05-23",3.8,"Pours an interesting orange. Mildly honey with some hops and citrus fruits. There is just a hint of spice to make it a little more interesting. I would definitely drink this again next May.","Levittown, New York, USA","Chapel"
1866,"2007-06-09",3.5,"Tap at the brewpub - comes out of the tap a clear golden with a slight orange tint to it - very full aroma of bright fruity qualities, some grassy hops and herbal notes, all underpinned with a honey sweetness - initial flavors are of butterscotch and slight diacytil (a little off-putting) - smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel - spicy hops, wildfower honey, and berry-like fruity esters come into play, making the beer interesting, almost making up for the unwelcome butterscotch flavors - still quite good, but a little too heavy, and not as clean as I like my maibocks to be.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1866,"2007-05-29",3.6,"on tap at the brewpub, with beastiefan2k.  Amber in color with a small off white head.  Aroma is fruity and malty, caramel and lightly bready.  Taste is smooth caramel with some fruit notes- apple, moderately toasty, with light notes of bread. medium bodied. Finishes moderately bitter.  very well balanced, brewer did a good job with this one.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
1866,"2007-05-29",3.4,"Growler from Brewpub: Pours a crisp clear orange with near perfect clarity and a fading off-white head. Simple aroma: mainly a sweet doughy malt character comes out with a spicy hop hint. Nice creamy mouth feel. The flavor is slightly more developed than the aroma. Nice balance of bready malts and spicy hops. Doughy malts give it the nice body and the finish offers a peppery hop touch. Well crafted Heller Bock, with nicely hidden alcohol.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
1866,"2007-05-28",3.6,"Tap @ brewpub, enjoyed with hophead75.  Poured into tall mug, orange-amber colored, a completely lucid beer.  Aroma is lagered fruitiness, which works well in the overall lightness of this beer.  Floral/herbal german hops and a cereal like maltiness.  Taste is cereal/grain/even lightly roasty, all is full flavored while the beer is relatively light and thirst quenching.  Light bitterness at the end. Definitely returnable and recommended.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
1866,"2006-05-12",3.8,"I quite liked this beer...on draft at the LI beer festival.  It was full-bodied and hoppy, with a nice pleasant dose of herbs and grass.  Slightly sweet, but finishes strong and clean .  Its refreshing too.  Not too light, not too heavy.  Great balance of citrus and sweet orange peels in the aroma.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
1866,"2006-05-12",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2006 Tap at the brewpub.  THis is a pretty solid clean well made maibock.  Pours vlear deep gold-light amber with a nice fluffy white head and nice lace.  Aroma is sharp bready pils malt, light munich, and a touch of herbal hops.  Lighter than expected body for the abv, and very clean.  Malty sweet with a crisp clean bitter finish.  A  tough lighter in body than some others I have had, but still a great example of the style.  Update- went back and had on tap later that night afterLi beerfest, and had from a different part of the bar- and a different line, but this sample tasted like bandaid so there must have been some dirty lines or an infected keg somewhere.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1866,"2005-04-29",3.5,"04.23.05  Tap at TAP NY. Hazed orange-gold.   Hoppy and kind of spicy/saazy/grassy on the nose, not sweet as I expected.  Well, maybe a touch plummy.  Lots of German inspired goodness in this brew.  Pear.  Raisin sweetness but its sharp, too.  Almost tends toward cloying and gets tiring by the end of the glass.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1866,"2004-10-18",3.6,"April, 2004. Hazy golden beer with a light banana aroma with nice wheat and cloves and bananas in tatse with a pleasant rich body.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
1866,"2004-05-28",5.0,"Beer Bad??
Buffy want Beer???

In the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode ""Beer Bad"" I think this is the beer that Xander serves Buffy and many others in a pub near the Sunnydale University campus.
The beer, however, dumbed down all the intellectual college kids and made them act like cavemen (and cave women..).
The best line of that episode is when Buffy, in a drunken state, exclaims, ""BUFFY WANT BEER!!"".
Im not sure which came first, the episode of Buffy or the real beer itself.","Bham, Alabama, USA","GrooveDaddy"
1866,"2004-05-01",3.5,"(Draught) Pours a cloudy, thin, white and quick dissipating head with an orange amber body. Nose of sweet malt and hops, somewhat orangy. Slightly fizzy, orange and creamy. Good.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
1866,"2004-04-29",3.8,"Freshly-grown peppery hops spicing up the haystack malt...Malt sweetness is loving the languorous citrusy film which is embracing it...Great lacing and lasting bitterness in a fuller body than Ramstein’s...This is a spring harvest which is certainly cultivating my curiosity about this brewery...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1866,"2004-04-27",4.0,"Sweet, orange, citrus, hoesey aroma. Hazy straw orange colour. Orange-tan head with some lacing. Nice malty flavour and good bitterness. Very well balanced. Excellent carbonation - slightly prickly but right at the threshold. Medium body and refreshing mouthfeel. Very enjoyable. On tap at TapNY festival.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
1866,"2004-04-26",2.7,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2004 Cloudy golden color. Ok beer. Malty fruity flavor. I had it twice, and felt the same way the second time I had it.  Not a clean finish, but dry and bitter. Everybody else thought it was good, I didn't.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
1866,"2004-04-25",3.9,"TAP NY sample.  Cloudy golden, nice lacing.  Delicate, light floral nose with hints of honey and vanilla.  Rich body, very malty and caramel-filled, just the right level of finishing bitterness to keep it from cloying.  Very good, perhaps the best of the many Maibocks at the fest.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1866,"2004-04-25",1.4,"Tap NY draft. The guys said this was a favorite, but my first taste made me first not want to rate it. So I went back to give it a second shot the next day with a fresh palate. Cloudy orange yellow. Yeasty sulfury aroma, and definitely not clean. Malty fruity yeasty flavor. Not a clean finish, but dry and bitter. I had to dump it.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
1866,"2004-04-25",4.1,"Draft at TAP NY.  Pours cloudy blonde/copper with a small off-white head.  Some mild hoppy aroma.  Mmm...very good.  Sweet, malty, grainy in the start with hops in the finish.  A very good complex maibock.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
