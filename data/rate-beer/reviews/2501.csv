It pours gold with white suds. Interestingly, Calyptra captures more of the dank side of Calypso and Citra. For me, that came as a pleasant surprise. Cereal grain and earthy hop aroma. Calyptra tastes like bread, grass, and honeydew. Crisp finish with a bit of lingering peppery spice. I havent really had anything else like it.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

2501,"2015-05-13",3.4,"12 ounce bottle from Sample 12 pack as ""Calyptra"" drunk March 2015Pale golden body with a tinge of copper and a moderate amount of white head that is well-retained. High clarity.Lush, floral hop notes are dotted with black pepper, moderate pine and a fair amount of red grapefruit-like fruitiness. The fruitiness is welcome and playful, but theres still an overarching pine/resin note that I was really hoping would be absent. Malt is lightly bready (dry caramel, biscuits) with no alcohol or flaws in the nose.Again, in the flavor, it initially gets my hopes up with marmalade, strawberry, grapefruit and heavy floral flavors, but the citrus gives way to pine and a bready, borderline grainy malt texture further discomforts the palate. The normally tight carbonation here works against the balance, really pronouncing the acids and after having one bottle, Im not too excited to go back for another one. Really cant stand these punchy/resiny-hopped beers at all. This one is far from one of the top offenders and its certainly clean but I just dont see much balance in these beers. To each their own, though, as I can appreciate many people not liking heavily sour beers the way I do.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2501,"2015-01-27",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Citrusy tropical fruit and their peppery resins reign supreme in this dry and quenching New World Lager.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam sets atop the hazy blond.
-Pilsener malts still manage to come out nicely under the expressive hop display.
-Drinkability is very high if you love New World hops.
-Tiny bubbles fit with the prevalent dryness.
-Hops are as aromatic in this one as their bitter.

Taste is a beautiful tropical hop expression with minimal bitterness. Juicy in every sense of the word. Chewy. Flavors of pineapple, mango, oranges. Infinitely deep and refreshing. Finish is crisp with satisfying minimal cracker malt and a large flavorful hop presence. Drying. 
THIS IS THE BEST PALE LAGER ON THE PLANET.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"

Taste is very tropical, lots of citrus and grapefruit, mildly bitter on the finish. Medium body, sticky mouthfeel, a little residual sugar but overall a really nice beer.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"

2501,"2014-05-20",3.9,"Bottle. The number or hop is not marked anywhere, I am assuming it is the latest. Pours hazy golden with a medium white head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving some nice residual foam that laces very well. Aroma is a bit of pot, pine, grain, citrus, some unidentified spice. Flavor is nice, very lightly sweet and light bitter, a bit spicy, citrus, pine, some pot but less than the nose, rye like spiciness. Light body, creamy mouthfeel. This is really nice.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2501,"2014-05-09",3.7,"Pours pale yellow into a shaker. Bright white head with little retention recedes to skim surface leaving soapy lacing. Sweet tropical fruit and mild funk aromas. Soft with sweet tropical fruit and yeast front to back and into the dry, lasting finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
2501,"2014-05-04",3.5,"Had on tap at the Grog. $7.50 for the full pint. Pours a hazy lemonade-tinted yellorange, with which a thin, whitish-ringed head 1 finger in length stood. Aromas of, all the usual suspects: lavender flowers, pine cones, copper, celery salt, chrysanthemum blossoms, biscuit malt, and Kalamata olives. Tastes the same with the addition of flax seeds, blue agave syrup, saké lees, Bible paper, and cotton. Chewy, welcoming, and exceedingly floral. Thanks, guys.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
2501,"2014-05-04",3.5,"Surprisingly the worst of the hopstitution variants even though it uses Citra. Overall this one came off grainy with some citrus and hay. Clean and drinkable but could use some more oomph.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
