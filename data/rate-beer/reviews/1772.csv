1772,"2014-07-14",4.2,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance has a nice bronzed amber color with a light transparency about it to have some light carbonation to be seen rising. There is a two finger white foamy head that mushroom caps and dissipates at a nice pace leaving a messy sort of thick lacing all around the glass.
The smell had some dried sweet caramel malts with a rich sort of nuttiness running underneath to amplify a wonderful aroma.
The taste was extremely nice through the rich caramel malts and a delicate nutty flavoring.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation ends up being somewhat smooth and creamy but still lets in enough harshness.
Overall, whoah, where did this come from Schmaltz? Good job with making a very good Vienna Lager.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1772,"2013-08-04",3.1,"Bold, orange-amber in color with a full, off-white colored head, this beer is clean with moderate carbonation. The aroma is simply of an amber lager, with light caramel easily dominating the nose. A grainy character is also present, coupling with a dusty antique smell. The flavor is as expected, but very close in redness to that of an amber ale. Caramel malts prevail slightly over the inherent overall lager character. Something earthy
remains at its core, though, and shines in the finish. Its likely pilsener malts and perhaps the character of its hops, but it simply tastes like the caramel simply, and finally, takes the back seat. Overall, not that I pleasant, but still much better than most amber lagers.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Taste: Its rare that you can smell malts in a lager (aside from a doppelbock), so you can imagine how much that will come through in the taste. And indeed Coney Island Lager is quite malty. The bottle indicates it uses 8 different malts and 6 types of hops. They certainly work well together, creating for a slightly toasty, biscuity malt taste with accompanying bitterness. A light caramel flavor is present as well, mostly on the finish, and provides a good balance to the standard ""beer"" taste found here. 

Drinkability: You could mistake Coney Island Lager for an ale due to the taste, but the actual drinkability is classic lager style. The fizziness makes the mouthfeel quite lively all the way through with a slight carbonation burn if drank too fast. The mouthfeel is thick than your average lager in conjunction with a perfectly medium bodied palate, but mostly clean in the aftertaste (although I would not describe this beer as being refreshing). The 5.5% ABV weight seems to fit that frame perfectly: more ""pep"" than your average lager, but nothing even approaching the stronger or imperial territories.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Crackly pale ale malts, cereal grains, and a spicy/herbal hop character in the aroma; a touch coarse. Medium body; medium-high carbonation; following the nose, the approach is rough here: excess CO2, sharp bitterness and (seemingly) some tannic qualities from the malt; the flavors endearing once one gets past that, showing some really nice cereal grains, spicy hop flavor, and toasty Pils malt; plenty tasty going on here, but a muddled and sharp mouthfeel isnt helping.

1772,"2008-08-09",3.3,"Thankfully I suffer from neither an irrational fear of clowns nor any qualms about being a wee bit of a freak myself. Take that, mix in some various lagers from Coney Island Brewing, and voila.

Currently only available in a 22oz bomber, my Coney Island Lager pours a deep orange amber hue, definitely a surprise from the light yellow lager I was expecting. A decent head of foam lingers, and then fades into a miniscule ring around my glass. In the nose I get some sweet malt and nutty character, with a crisp oily hop presence lingering in the background. Coney has had a few minutes to ""warm"" since I first poured her, and as I take my first quaff, an explosion of wet hop oils, bitter lemon rind and fresh cut grass. Backing it up are light sweet caramel and nutty notes. Despite its malty picture, hops are definitely taking precedence in the Coney Island Lager. As I delve deeper into my brew, the malty background of nuts and light caramel sweetness blends more smoothly with the domineering hop profile. A wet, medium body beer, the oils and hop esters seek solace under a soothing malty cover. This is definitely a beer that can benefit from a few minutes of ""warming"" to truly bring out all the flavor profiles in a palate pleasing balance.

Overall, an interesting interpretation of the lager style. While not overly intense in hops and malts, Coney Island Lager blends the two for a heavier palate. I would definitely enjoy another, but I wouldn’t consider her my favorite lager flavor.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The hops are a good blend of more citric american flavors, and more earthy and spicy european character.   At first, it seems like a hoppy APA, but the light, crisp body and cleaner flavors let you know that you are drinking a lager.   I love hoppy lagers, and this one is definitely well done.

L: Slightly hazy appearance, amberish copper in color with an inch high head of beige fluffy foam that leaves behind a patchy amount of lace that follows the body down the glass as I consumed it.

S: Leafy, spicy, citric hops are the first smells I noticed, followed by toasted caramel and grains. Further whiffs bring out aromas of butter and honey bread. I like the aroma on this lager, it has that twist on the style that Ive come to expect from Shmaltz.

F&T: Smooth and softly crisp mouthfeel, touches of oily hop stickiness on the tongue, ending on a gulp inducing creamy note. This also possesses a good malty heftiness that makes this quite easy to consume. Obviously well thought out, well crafted blend of malts and hops, enough malty sweetness to combat the sour bitterness of the hops. Toasted malty tastes of caramel, grainy bread and toffee, towards the end flavors of honey butter and caramelized sugar add sweetness to the sour citric hops. The hops tastes hold their own and emerge slightly on top at the end. The peels of lemons and grapefruit, tea leafy, herbal earthy, finishing with a mild citric spicy bitterness. The finish also has a quick, clean dryness to it that makes the mouth water for more.

Pours a clear amber. Big cream head. Nice color. Fragrance is a slight caramel tone with some wood on there as well. Nothing significant going on here, but I feel like what little is there is earthy. Flavor is slightly hoppy, but then a smooth malty smoothness kicks in. Interesting. Complex. Slight woody sweetness. Feel is good. Not a whole lot of body on the liquid, but a nice bubble on there.

1772,"2008-01-21",3.8,"Pours with an almost three finger thick, light tan colored head.  The beer is brilliantly clear, but is a nice red color, which I wasnt expecting, when held up to the light the beer shows a red-hued, copper color.  The aroma is a nice mix of fruity hops and sweet malt.  The hop character, while somewhat soft, has a real nice mix of spice and herbal notes to it; touches of cinnamon, hints of sweet basil and perhaps a touch of lemon grass.  Soft, sweet malt character that is lightly caramelized and has a touch of berry-like fruitiness to it (though this is most assuredly contributed by the hops as well) is found up front, while the finish has notes of crushed soda crackers and dusty malt to it.  The aroma, while somewhat subtle overall, is really quite nice; I really am enjoying the interplay between hop and malt and how much each of them bring to the aroma.

Lightly sweet as it hits the tongue for the first time, the beer quickly picks up a nice herbal hoppiness as well as a soft, nip of bitterness.  Underlying caramelized grain notes and sweet grain contribute a slight body to this brew that provides a palate coating fullness that I was not necessarily expecting of this brew (meaning it drinks a little bigger than its 5.5% might suggest).  This has a ton of malt and hop character; herbal, almost mint-like, fruity with berry notes, touches of bergamot, slightly astringent / green hops in the finish, biscuit notes, crushed soda crackers, chewy bread crust and perhaps a touch of grape-like or honey like malt character.

Quite clean tasting (as a good lager should be), but it has a nice full flavor of malt and hop character.  Really the only thing keeping this from being incredibly good is that the hop character gets a touch too astringent and green in the finish.  This is definitely a really pleasant surprise, I wasnt expecting much when I cracked the top of this brew.  I have no idea what ""style"" this beer is, the interesting use of American hops here puts this in a category of its own, but it is quite tasty and certainly worth tracking down for the lower-alcohol lager lovers out there.

1772,"2007-08-24",3.4,"Pour is a dark brown with a large soapy white head.   Aroma is nice crisp hop with a huge helping of caramel malts.  Flavor is about the same.  Some pine hops with a very caramel malt backbone.  Deffinatly not a typical lager but worth having around the house for a lazy afternoon.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1772,"2007-08-23",3.7,"In the bomber bottle from Beertopia. Pours amber with a medium-sized thick fluffy ivory colored head. I think that this beer might make me realize what the term ""Session Beer"" really means! It has a mild aroma of flowery nectar water and subdued hops. This is smooth and easy to drink. The mild hop bitterness at the finish is mildly pine-like. Has a great palate and is perfectly hopped for such a medium bodied lager. The brilliance to this beer is that it does not over or under state anything. Yummy and worth drinking often.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"
1772,"2007-08-22",3.8,"Bomber.  Poured clear healthy caramel with lots of rising carbonation and a short cap of beige head.  The aroma was quite enjoyable with wet grass and bready sweetness accented by ample doses of floral and citrusy hoppage.. very Czech-lagery as one might say.  Flavor was even better.. crisp bread and fruity notes at the core with bright citrus and floral bitterness leaving an exclamation on the finish.  Crisp and clean on the palate with a smooth flow.  Didnt see this one coming!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1772,"2007-08-22",3.7,"Highly filtered, with a big-bubbled, off-white head over a copper-colored body.  Dark for a lager.  Ill start with my favorite part of this beer: the finish.  It is very smooth and fruity.  Crisp and clean.  The flavor is mild but good.  Very malty.   It really does taste pretty much like a Czech-style lager.  Good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
1772,"2007-08-22",3.6,"Clear copper beer, with a pillowy white head that is well-sustained by the bubbly body - spicy european hop aroma, with notes of butter and bread - the flavor is fairly robust - crisp hop bite up front, followed by some biscuit and gingerbread, then some butter and caramel come into play - some light peppery hints and a long-lingering hop profile - it gets a bit sweet near the end, but the hops do a nice job of keeping it in check - this seems more like a Vienna than anything else, and a fairly tasty one at that.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1772,"2007-08-18",3.6,"22oz bomber.  Filtered with an evolving amber to golden hue.  Finger width of creamy off-white head.  Sweet citrusy cereal aromas.  Touch doughy.  Medium bodied with a nice crisp palate.  Dry and effervescent.  Good malt character.  Cookie and caramel.  Nice bitterness.  Nice and big for the style.  Great swirl around the mouth.  Only down side is the soapy lingering flavor.  The finish is big and bright.  Spicy peppery piney citrusy hops.  Ill be having more of these!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"
1772,"2007-08-17",3.6,"Bottle @ the Coney Island Freak Show. Amber with a dense creamy head. Has a nice chewy body and a sweet caramel malt aroma, along with spicy hops. Has a European Strong Lager feel to it. Lots of bready, caramel malts to give it body. Along with peppery zesty hops (Hallertau) that balance it nicely. A well made lager.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"
1772,"2007-08-16",3.5,"Pours deep amber with a tall cream colored head. Hoppy lager, with a rich caramel and ceral flavor, crisp and spicy hops, and trailing bitter finish. I liked it, although a touch more sweetness would improve it for me, a bit sharp in the bitterness hides the nice malt flavors.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1772,"2007-08-15",3.3,"Bottle.  Pours an ambery, hoppy looking brown and tastes it too. Some cinnamon and bitterness with a bit of sweetness to finish. Pretty decent, would make a good session beer I think.","New York, USA","Maverick34"
1772,"2007-08-15",3.8,"Attractive clear orange amber body with a sturdy almond head. Aroma of caramel, spicy hops and some fruity esters. Nicely balanced with spicy and earthy hop bitterness and toasty caramel maltiness. A hint of red apples underneath. Nice drinking lager.","Jenkins, Kentucky, USA","merlin48"
1772,"2007-08-13",3.7,"Poured a bronze-copper colored body with a chunky and frothy beige-white head. Nose of grains and floral hops. An all-around nice afternoon beer!","Portland, Oregon, USA","Angeloregon"
1772,"2007-08-08",3.6,"Only available in Minnesota and New York from what Ive been told. Note to self: Dont open a bomber right after you remove it from the refrigerator if its been laying on its side. Beer goes all over. Profits from this brew go to help Coney Island.

Pours a nice clear golden copper caramel color with a nice white head sitting on top. The foam slowly settles and leave no real lacing. Looks like a good lager should. Sweet malty aroma up front and then a bit of fruit and a strange touch of hops you dont expect from a lager. Fruit mixed with caramel fill the nose with a slight bit of bitterness in the distance. Very nice but not expected. Smooth caramel malt body flows over the tongue. Nice and crisp on the end. The aftertaste brings with it a nice fruity hop flavor. Bit of bitterness at the end of the aftertaste. Nice lager and easy to drink. Pretty cool stuff.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WankerWeasel"
1772,"2007-08-08",3.8,"Nose of spice, grass, & perfume.  Pours a clear copper.  The nice cascade resolves into a fully lasting off-white rocky head that leaves behind good lace.  The brew is spicy with a good malt profile well balanced by a more than adequate hops presence.  The rewarding finish is long.  The medium creamy body is lively and feels clean at the finish.  I have a bone to pick with whoever entered this brew as a ""Pale Lager"".  IMHO this is a perfect example of a ""Premium Lager"".","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
1772,"2007-08-08",3.7,"Pours a rich golden with no head.  Super biscuity malt with some honey and a light floral touch on the nose.  Flavor is kinda muddled and confusing, but lends a sweet almost cotton candy, or honeysuckle type sweetness, with a nice floral hop finish.","Farewell Minny; Hello Puyallup, Washington, USA","joebrew"
1772,"2007-08-05",3.0,"Bronze colored liquid with a wispy bigger bubbled off-white head. Touches of malt and light caramel in the minimal aroma. Hint of floral hops, but there again just a hint. Light caramel flavor with a touch of sweet herbal hops and lightly toasted malt. Certainly drinkable. Some light sour dough bread buttered with a sweet cream butter hides in the finish. Once again there is nothing in your face about this beer, except the label. Another light amber lager for the masses.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1772,"2007-07-22",3.1,"Draught at ReBar.  Darkish gold to amber color with a light cereal malt aroma spiked with some fresh grass and lemon hops.  Toasty, slightly sweet cereal malt flavor with balancing citrusy hops.  Some pleasant fruity (appley) notes throughout as well...a nice surprise for a lager.  Basically decent for a ""kitsch"" beer, though I know the bottles are way overpriced.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"
1772,"2007-07-22",3.2,"Here we have a clear case of a purchase made for the label art. Love that cool circus freak. A Schmltz fan, but never a lager lover, I bought it to look at that awesome design. So be it.

Clear amber color. Nice bubbles above.

Slightly sweet nose, minor hops, but there. Largely quiet.

Taste: smooth, clean, and watery. Just like a good lager should be. Hops dance happily on the tongue, before disappearing. Eight malts make for smoothness and creamy-tivity, with a lasting tingle on the palate. 
Quite tasty.
Hail freaks, geeks, barkers, and carnies!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
1772,"2007-07-18",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2007 Amber-gold with a light malty nose.  Light earthiness with a touch of caramel and faint grassiness as well.  Flavour is decently malty with light earthy hops.   Moderately sweet up front, light graininess throught the middle with a touch of grassy hops on the back.  I didnt enjoy it all that much the first few times, but its grown on me lately... oh, yeah, and the label is beyond creepy.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1772,"2007-07-12",3.2,"On tap at Mugs. Amber in color with a nice white head. Light hoppy malty aroma. Grainy notes. Hoppy flavor. Caramel notes. Light malty character. Thin. Light tasting. Clean finish. Ok beer.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
1772,"2007-07-10",3.0,"Very good for the style.  Light hop aroma.  Flavor has malt and enough hops that I might call this an English pale ale, almost.  Creepy label.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1772,"2007-07-08",3.3,"Amber Color with Off White Head.  Malt and Floral Hops Aroma.  Nice Caramel Flavor Mixed with Subtle Hop Taste.  Tasted Closer to an Amber. Alot of Nice Session Flavor for a Lager.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"

Finish is a clean and crisp with a slight watery aftertaste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1772,"2007-06-29",3.0,"Dark gold color with no head.  Aroma of cotton candy and corn.  More of the same in the flavor along with a very musty hop taste.  Slightly sour finish.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

The mouthfeel turns the classic bitter flavors into a lightly sweet fruit flavor.  The fiinish is crisp with the correct amount of bitterness.  I found about this beer from my friends at Bierkraft in Brooklyn.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","JAF737300"
