Dry, lighlty oily and warming on the palate. Some boozy flavors and also some cooked rice. Quite fruity flavor that lasts. A decent sake indeed, but a bit boozy-feeling.

1621,"2009-12-11",3.6,"150 ml Can. Three years past its drink by, though it has been refrigerated the whole time. 
Slightly sweet aroma, with caramel, peach, condensed milk. Clear and slightly viscous. Slightly oxidized flavor, with melon and pear, pepper, milk, caramel. Alcohol very noticeable, with a tingle on the tongue. Rather high acidity. Clean and crisp. This is generally a rather light-flavored ginjo, and I think the extra age has probably made it more characterful. Decent stuff, though still a bit too subtle and light (=watery=mizu no gotoshi).","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
1621,"2009-08-05",3.4,"Poured from 750ml into guinomi: cold: My first sake rating, but not my first tasting.  Tasted with a delicious salmon and mahi mahi dish.  Pours perfectly clear.  Nose is very floral, light fruits.  The floral notes continue into the taste but are, however, nicely balanced by the dry quality. Light in body yet deep in taste, very easily drinkable.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","CUJO"
1621,"2007-10-12",2.9,"300ml bottle: Niigata-ken is known throughout Japan as the ""Mecca"" for top notch sake. Clear as mountain spring water. Jordan pretty much nailed the scent dead on. It is interesting to compare various ""Junmai"" and non ""Junmai"" types of sake to see how the added alcohol really changes the the sake, not only the aroma and taste but the feel as well. This does have a dry flavor that reminds me a bit of vermouth. I tried this at several temperatures, the best being either very cold or warm (not hot)., chilled (as I prefer most sake) doesnt work for this one.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
1621,"2007-09-20",3.3,"180mL Bottle: Clear, nose of light fruity butter, sweet and chewy nose, very light anise, some alcohol and dry rice notes. The flavor is clean and light, a sweet impact with fruit and a dry alcoholic mouthfeel. The finish is short and dry, leaving a peanut shell note lingering on the tongue. Nice nose and initial impact, but its a challenge to drink after that. I think Ive had this one before","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
