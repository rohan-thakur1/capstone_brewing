1027,"2017-04-26",4.0,"Poured as part of a ""Derivation flight"" with blends 1-7 including Double Barrel (sans blend 5). Again a thick black with little/no carbonation. Nose is much more integrated and less brash than blend 1. Vanilla, dark chocolate especially, but not a lot of malt backbone. Round and integrated in the mouth, a bit less thick than blend 1. Lots of sweet vanilla, for me it was missing much backbone though. Lots of adjuncts.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

1027,"2016-09-27",4.8,"Bottle shared at A Day To Sink All Sea Shepards tasting. Full lineup of 1-6 + DB. Black with a ring tan head. Aroma of big vanilla, chocolate, caramel, toffee, soy. Flavour is heavy sweet, moderate to heavy bitter and big umami. Full bodied with a thick chewy texture and soft carbonation. Having tried this against the rest I can see why this is considered the best. Superb. [17-09-2016]","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"

1027,"2016-03-11",4.1,"(From notes; tasted 7/11/2015). Bottle. Heavy vanilla paces the strong aroma laced with dark chocolate, musty oak, and not nearly as much bourbon as Blend #1. The pour resembles used motor oil topped with a beige head that hangs around. A delightful blend of dark chocolate, vanilla, burnt grains and whiskey greets the tongue, but overall the flavor isnt as complex as the first blends. Fairly thick body. A very nice barrel-aged imperial stout, but I prefer Blend #1 a tad more over this one.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
1027,"2016-03-04",4.8,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours ink-black with a mid-sized, brown head. The aroma features gobs of dark chocolate, hot fudge, dark berries, whiskey, pouch tobacco and the most inviting vanilla component Ive ever run across. Super full-bodied with a silken, thick mouthfeel and adequate carbonation. The flavor is a lush collage of bittersweet brownie brittle, deeply roasted mocha and pouch tobacco with a delicious, lingering, vanilla and bourbon finish. I LOVE THIS BEER! A shout out to 50belair for providing me the chance to enjoy this world-class treat!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1027,"2015-10-03",4.8,"Bottle shared by john, thank you! Pour is amazing viscous black with a thin ring of sanguine foam. Aroma is rich and sweet with notes of wheat, roasted malt, honey, whiskey, and light smoke. Lots going on. Flavor is just staggering: Flavor starts with toffee malt and marshmallow. That evolves into wheat and light smoke with lots of vanilla and bourbon notes. Palate is crazy thick and smooth. Just the most rich, well - balanced huge stout I have had. Lingering light smoke and toffee malt for minutes. As good as advertised.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
1027,"2015-09-08",3.9,"Pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma has lots of soy sauce off the bat, chocolate, fudge, coconut, bourbon and heavy smooth roast. It has a full rich body with soft carbonation. The taste has heavy chocolate, vanilla, cream, soy sauce, cacao and some spice. The finish has very heavy alcohol and powdered cocoa. Very nice imperial stout, but showed the 15% alcohol more than I would have liked.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1027,"2015-09-07",4.9,"750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Pours a deep, dark, murky - but not quite opaque, given highlights around the edges - brown with a small brown head that settles into a small lasting ring. Vanilla in the aroma is what immediately sets this apart from the other one, but its never overdone. I worried itd be too sweet as it warmed, but that wasnt the case. Its a gorgeous sweet layer atop fudge, toasted marshmallow, coconut, roasted malts, toasted brown sugar, marzipan, oak, caramel, and cocoa beans. Full-bodied, just a little bit thicker than Blend #1, with a smooth, velvety, sweet mouthfeel that coats the palate. Modest carbonation. I initially liked #1 better, but #2 is as well done as a barrel-aged stout with vanilla can be. It never overpowers with sweetness, remaining in perfect balance all the way. I couldnt pick a favorite between the two, and both kept getting their scores bumped. Astonishingly good. This is way beyond my ridiculously high expectations.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Taste has a huge amount of vanilla also. Heavy chocolate fudgy sweetness, Light smokiness that really just blends into a bitter roasted malt flavor. Boozy. Extremely heavy. Low carbonation.
