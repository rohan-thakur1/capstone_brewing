598,"2015-11-15",3.8,"Shared with Dan in Boca. Snifter pour was medium amber and some small head. Aroma is Belgian yeasts, biscuit, dark fruits, and toffee. Taste is similar. Dark fruits and matls not overly sweet like a lot in this style. Some dry hopp characteristics. Medium body and carb. A little more mild in flavors than many in this style. But very tasty.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"
598,"2015-10-21",3.6,"Pours copper tones. As usual with SA beers, the nose is in moderation. Nice malt backbone with a milder hop profile. Not quite a traditional Belgian dubbel but this works quite well.","Seattle still not near Beersel., Washington, USA","bleeng"
598,"2015-05-17",4.6,"Another great beer from Saint Arnold. Darker than a traditional dubbel, but was a pleasant drink, nice flavors, and not too heavy. Try a single first if you can, but don't feel bad buying the four pack! Enjoy!

598,"2015-02-02",3.5,"4 pack from HEB pearland. Poured into wide bottom tulip. Aroma dominated by candy syrup. Sweetness of the candy syrup comes first, then middle note is intertwined by both the sorachi hops, slight citrus lemongrass, and the Belgian yeast; then finishes a little boozy and sweet. Great addition to the icon family.","","ethanTHEtrill"

598,"2015-01-26",3.5,"In the light, a deep amber pour, very shy tan head. Nose is somewhat medicinal with aromas of dried fruit. Bittersweet. Middle is light citrus burst, followed by molasses and spice coating of the tongue. Finish ends slightly citrus through the malt. Different and interesting.","Austin, Texas, USA","ttoadee"
598,"2015-01-22",4.1,"Saint Arnold Icon Red Sorachi Ace Dubbel has a thin, cream-colored head (wide-brim glass), a mostly clear, copper, bubbly appearance, with powdery sediment suspended throughout, and not much lacing left behind. The aroma is of spiced holiday bread, a shade of banana and coriander, and possibly a touch of brown sugar. Taste is of those elements with a straightforward background hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and slick, and Saint Arnold Icon Red Sorachi Ace Dubbel finishes semi-dry and easy drinking. RJT","Laplace, Louisiana, USA","ronaldtheriot"
598,"2015-01-08",3.6,"Hoppy and Belgiany without going anywhere near the Belgian IPA fad. Caramel and dark fruit with a bitter citrus twist.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
598,"2015-01-05",3.4,"Superior dubbel. A dubbel with a big twist of lemon. On tap at the brewery. Pretty drnkable. Still overally sweet but interesting.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
598,"2015-01-04",3.9,"love the different take on a dubbel .. . sweet wort, toffee, and that distinct sorachi ace hop slice. . mild mouth feel and a medium sticky finish .. a well done dubbel, but im not crazy for them to start with ..  Im not gonna call him dad.

I would never expect you to call him dad.

Well Im not going to EVER. Even if theres a FIRE!",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
598,"2015-01-03",3.7,"Draft. Red pour. It is unlike pretty much any dubbel I have tried. It is sweet and candy like but not breast and malty. Like a Belgian imperialaber or something.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
598,"2014-12-28",3.4,"Clear dark ruby with a thin sticky light beige head. Nice herbal and candied sugar nose with a bit of toffee. The flavor is a bit leafy and sweet and boozy with a slight metallic and leafy hoppy bitter.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
598,"2014-12-27",3.6,"Medium brown with a thin off-white head. Fruity and slightly citrus hop aroma. Definitely taste the Sorachi Ace...for me this has a tropical fruit type flavor. Caramel and toasted malt flavors. This is good but loses a lot of the spicy Belgian yeast characteristics that a dubbel normally possesses.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","ttutony"
598,"2014-12-10",3.6,"Tap at sugar land saucer. Dark clear reddish brown with a large creamy cream colored head. Lacing is fairly extensive. Aroma of grass, dark fruit, toasted caramel.
