2516,"2016-07-19",3.6,"Heller erfrischender Antrunk, hopfig-herb mit deutlicher Grasigkeit, die zunehmend bittere Aromen entwickelt. Nuancen von Kräuter, dann wieder hopfiger, an der nun eher rabiaten und trockenen Bitterkeit wird der geringe Alkoholgehalt erstmals ersichtlich. Spritzig, mittellanger weicher Nachhall.

2516,"2016-07-12",3.3,"0.33 l bottle from Bierlager, best before April 2017. Clear, golden yelow with athin, rather fluffy, slowly diminishing, white head. Sweetish, fruity-grassy and floral aroma of pineapple, fresh grass, lychee and caramel. Slightly bitter, a bit sweet, fruity-grassy and a bit floral taste of caramel, straw, pineapple, lychee and grains, followed by a short, moderately bitter, quite grassy and rather dry finish. Almost medium-bodied, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Really nice for that abv (India Session Lager?)!","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"
2516,"2016-06-19",3.5,"Für ein Leichtgewicht bietet dieses hier aber das volle Programm, was mich dann doch überrascht hat. Wunderbar eingehopft mit einer schön fruchtigen, zitronigen Tendenz, dabei jedoch im Abgang sogar leicht vanilin und blumig. Sehr ausgewogen, sehr stimmig eingebraut. Wunderbar.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"

2516,"2016-06-13",3.4,"bottle, díky pane doktore! Pale golden yellow, mid-sized white head, lovely aroma of fresh hops. Light-bodied, shy but good malty background. Lovely aromatic hops that add fruity flavours. A truly good beer for the summer!","Down South, GERMANY","Quack-Duck"
2516,"2016-05-27",3.2,"0,33 l bottle purchased at Bierzwerg bottle shop, Greven. Clear dark golden in the glass with an one finger foamy head. Surprisingly intensive floral hopy on the nose. Taste starts with a short floral hop sequence, followed by a more grainy and pale malt part, some citrus, with a floweresque hopy background. Amazingly complex for such a low alcohol beer. Little bit soapy with present bitterness to the end. Interesting.","Oldenburg, GERMANY","WillemsUrenkel"
2516,"2016-05-19",3.3,"(bottle, 33cl) Clear, pale golden colour with a blond medium-sized foamy head. Fresh hoppy aroma with fruity and delicately herbal accents, including notes of citrus, peaches and tropical hints, backed by a mildly grainy malty touch. Slightly bitter flavour, light bodied with a moderate carbonation. Discreetly grainy malty base with present fruity and slightly herbal hoppy notes tuning in and lingering into mildly hop bitter and slim malty finish. The lack of malty body is not eminent if you are aware of having a low alcoholic beer. 16.V.16","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
2516,"2016-05-19",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2016 From the bottle poured into Spiegelau IPA Glass. Pours clear golden with quickly vanishing white head. Nose is herbal citric hops. Taste is herbal too middle part is a bit watery most likely given to the 2,6% ABV. Finish is Pilsener like herbal astringent finish but only a short one. Given its a light Summer beer I tend to like it for its refreshing herbal style...","GERMANY","Salwal"
