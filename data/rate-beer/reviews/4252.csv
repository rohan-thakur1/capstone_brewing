4252,"2017-04-12",3.6,"Draught at Row 34, 2/22/17.Dark chocolate with a ruddy, dark amber tint, quite murky and topped by a tan head that is medium-sized but steadily fades to a ring.Cocoa, poignant raspberry acids and strong caramel backing it comprise the aroma which lends more vanilla as it warms and is surprisingly free from any overbearing alcohol. Definitely hints of sharpness here and there but its folded in to the bright fruit acidity and probably soaked up by the strong maltiness. Doesnt come off fudgey/cakey, though, and the chocolate notes blend with light roast and a spicy pepper character from the raspberry seeds to produce an interesting, complex nose.In the mouth its certainly rich, malty and quite sweet at times, though theres ample, engaging carbonation and strong acidity from the fruit to help break up/balance the malt. Warming finish with light roast, dark chocolate and light ash and vanilla. Huge and malty, but it doesnt feel overly sugary/cakey/underfermented like many of the adjunct stouts in a similar class. Good for dessert and actually drinkable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Big front taste of raspberries with cream, turning to some molasses, citrus zest and just a touch chocolate. Finish spotlights more of a tart slant on the raspberries along with some wood and dried grass. Well disguised abv in this heavy bodied brew. Almost-medium fizz provides a welcome tongue tingle, yet remains pretty smooth.

4252,"2016-12-03",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Raspberry jam and cherry pits galore rise from this decadently fruity dessert, leading to discreet acidity and even more sugar.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A lofty head of foam covers the reddish darkness.
-The nose has an uncanny resemblance with Kuhnhenns Raspberry Eisbock. Thats a great thing, by the way.
-The finish is a tad lazy. Could see a touch more fruity acidity and length there.
-The carbonation is appropriately soft and fluffy.
-All that being said, this is a very successful dessert beer. Memorable stuff.

4252,"2016-05-20",4.0,"13.1%ABV.  Trippelbock.

Poured out black-burgundy.  The color of congealed and dried blood or the contents of a boudin noir.  40ºSRM.

Nose has smoke, dark malt sweetness, and the candy sweet fruitiness of a Jolly Rancher candy.

Mouthfeel is soupy and almost syrupy.  Palate has immediately competing taste experiences:  dark bread, roasted malt sweetness, the roasty flavors of a bock and the sweet alcoholic, and medicinal and herbal flavors of a Belgian tripel and the sweet fruitiness of a raspberry compote.

Finish is clean.  This is wondrous given the ponderous grain bill that produced this soupy feeling brew.
Again the overall impression with this is like drinking a prune-grape or a cherry-pear nectar, something fruity  and unfiltered.

Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big juicy/tart raspberry, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, toasted brown bread, cherry, plum, red grape, red wine, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, raspberries, and moderate fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big juicy/tart raspberry, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, toasted brown bread, cherry, plum, red grape, red wine, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate fruity/acidic tartness and tannic bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of juicy/tart raspberry, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, toasted brown bread, cherry, plum, red grape, red wine, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, raspberries, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitter/tarness balance; with a light amount of tannic astringency after the finish. Good amount of dryness from acidity and tannic bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, acidic/tannic, and lightly creamy/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding fruited Eisbock! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, raspberries, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. This has more in common with a strong red wine/fruit beer than an eisbock overall; but still has a nice amount of malt complexity in the background to support the strong fruity flavors.

Aroma: Smells smiliar to red wine, with a raspberry note.
Appearance: Pours a cola colour, with a light tan head.
Taste: The first sip just punches you in the face! Ouch! It gets better after a few sips. A slightly sweet red wine taste, with a very tart hit of raspberries. A mellow coffee aftertaste.
Palate: A sharp tarty taste, followed by a smooth finish. Medium body. Light carbonation.
Overall: Not my thing at all. It tastes very similar to red wine, and the minimal carbonation doesnt help that. Too tarty, and reminiscent of the vinegar taste found in red wine. A nice coffee aftertaste though.","Preston, Lancashire, ENGLAND","swampwater"
