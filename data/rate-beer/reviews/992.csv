992,"2017-06-20",4.1,"Bottle.
Pours murky dark yellow with a huge frothy white head. Nice!
Aroma has lots of citrus/grapefruit, malt sweetness, yeast and clove/herbs.
Taste is refreshing, sweet and surprisingly bitter with some yeast and caramel/cookie doughy shining through.
Medium body, high carbonation, round yet dry mouth feel.
Long lingering bitter after taste.
A great thirst quencher that surprised me by the high bitterness, I expected something more traditionally hopped but the modern hops doesnt take overhand.","SWEDEN","Garlic_of_Doom"

992,"2017-05-26",3.6,"Slightly darker than golden, quite hazy on second pour. Big and quite dense white head, good retention and very nice lacing. Quite vivid aroma of hay, fresh fruitiness (yellow fruits in the likes of peach, pear, lemon), slight peppery spiciness and a grassy hint. Overall it kind of feels like farmland on a sunny day. Taste has crackery malts base, fruitiness as per nose, slight spiciness and an earthy/yeasty feeling on the back of things. Overall slightly on the sweet side with a good dose of herbal/grassy hops in a still mildly bitter finish. Maybe feeling a bit less bright in taste than in the nose. Light bodied with quite high carbonation, with a lively but still very easy mouthfeel. Nicely refreshing and decently complex. A well made, very belgian beer.","ITALY","ozzatoadisback"

Opened this ill-informed and slightly misguided by the typically dated 70s comic label that this would be a Light and fruity Blanche de Namur Wit, but had to settle for something a but more complex, more like a confident Belgian saison Keller. Very assertive cloudy yeast profile, not sparking fruity esters but working in perfect accord with grassy and herbal, lemon balm hops (did not pick up on any US hops, nor does the label mention any). Easy drinking, like a meatier Dupont with a twist or a Blanche with a reticent attitude. One to revisit under less thirsty auspices. / rerate 01/2015 draught at Bar Le Grincheux, Strasbourg: close to De la Sennes dry Belgian ale yeast profile and herbal honey blossom hops.

992,"2013-04-27",5.0,"e extraordinaire, et pourtant je ne suis pas un fanatique des bières à 5,2 % abv
(un peu maigrichon), mais disons que lesprit de celle-ci est plutôt dans le style des blanches,
donc le taux dalcool est « normal » pour ce genre de bière. Ceci dit cette bière est bien une
blonde, mais une blonde dété, faite pour désaltérer. On pourrait dire dans le même sens, 
dans lesprit des saisons, qui sont aussi des bières de désoif pour lété.
Cette artisanale refermentée en bouteille est une grande bière.
Couleur doré moyen brillant. Clarté nette. Bulles moyennes à fines partout dans le verre, 
pareille à un feu dartifices. (Et pourtant mon exemplaire de 75 cl est à date en mars 2013,
donc tout juste au timing...). Mousse blanche, épaisse et bien crémeuse. Superbe.
Arômes de houblons très fins, avec une touche de pamplemousse rose et de fleurs des bois (la brasserie est située en Gaume, tout près de la grande forêt de lArdenne, et de la superbe forêt dAnlier, cela lui donne de linspiration ).Splendide. 
Texture de la 1ère bouche quasi veloutée, saveurs magnifiques de houblons et
malts confondus et aussi séparés. Arrière-bouche avec une pointe de piment, et lamertume
dun superbe houblon. 
La 2ème bouche donne une splendide ampleur de la texture, avec toujours cette amertume fine.
La 3ème bouche est pleine, entière, magique. Rétro-nez toujours bien houblonné.
La longueur est très constante, avec des nuances de fleurs, des fruits blancs et une pointe 
dépices fines.
Lalcool est bien dans lesprit de la saison, cest très bien ainsi (ça me coûte de le dire),
et il est bien proportionné.
La levure (et ici, pour autant que lon laisse un peu de volume de bière avec la levure de
refermentation, on est en droit de penser à la couleur dune blanche dans le verre, mais
une blanche bien dense ) est superbe, précise, fine, douce, délicieuse, soyeuse, délicate,
tendre, admirable, aimable, caressante, lisse. Un petit chef doeuvre...
La finale se laisse savourer, humer, ressentir, goûter, déguster autant que vous le souhaitez.
Bière qui est un chef doeuvre pur et simple du brassage artisanal, et qui fait date dans 
lhistoire de la bière. On ne peut quêtre admiratif devant cette beauté de Rulles 
Même si la spécialité de lendroit est plutôt le français avec le grammairien Maurice Grevisse, je vais faire des mathématiques, mais très rapides et intuitives en accordant un 5 à cette merveille.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

992,"2011-12-26",4.0,"One of the best ""summer"" brews imaginable; OK so this review starts with a spoiler, but anyway the rating is visible, aint it? Green 750cc bottle with light green label depicting the usual ""Rulles"" character, feet plunged in the water, enjoying a glass of fine ale while out fishing; a bike in the background suggests he will not drive a car to get back home, and thats fine, I guess. Pours opalescent gold to amber with beautiful consistent white foam head; nose is dominated by the subtle texture of hops. It is very hard to brew such a complex and refined beer with such muscular American herbs, but this exceptional brewer, Gregory Verhelst, succeeded; and now this is no less Belgian and ""classic"" than older and full European labels. In the mouth, an explosion of herbal freshness, but anyway of good balance. This is definitely a great, savory, summer ale, and Im telling you now, in the heart of winter.

992,"2009-05-21",3.4,"Maybe it takes an eclectic personality balanced by an open mind to appreciate and venture into the infinitely diverse world of beer, in light of both the good and the bad and anything in between. But then again, maybe not. No matter whom you are or what walk of life you come from, all it takes is an open mind and an open palate, something I would like to believe everyone is capable of. Those who are not I believe have made the choice not to be, and are thus doing themselves a disservice by not realizing their full potential.


A haze of soft golden hay topped by a cloud of white relaxes in my glass while gentle tendrils of lace make their mark. A few gentle swirls and a fresh burst of foam rises to the top, then settles once more into slumber while leaving more lacy trails. Right away, a wave of sharp acidity resembling cat pee and funk grabs my senses while lemon and spice sprinkled with peppercorn tickles the back of my nose. Sharp and piercing right off the bat, her nose settles into a soft bouquet of coriander, orange, and honey. Quite an interesting conflict of interests. Our first embrace is light with a wisp of a bitter, dry finish while soft floral esters permeate her palate. Creeping in with the dry bitter finish is delightfully biting sour funk slathered with a crisp lemon pucker. Further in, her body continues onto a fuller, chewier path while more citric skin lingers long into her finish. Is that a hint of juniper I detect mingling with her floral undertones? A very down-to-earth homely brew, I feel as if I am being embraced by the Mother herself, taking in all her aromatic and tactile splendor. A final flourish of sour funk finishes her off quite perfectly, in my opinion.


I had no idea what to expect going into my La Rulles Estivales Biere de Gamme, and what a deliciously exotic surprise she turned into. Officially categorized as a Belgian Ale, all I or anyone else really needs to know is that she was perfectly delicious. Styles are pertinent, yes, but only so far as being able to give your understanding of a beer and its palate a home. May I have another, please.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

992,"2008-06-24",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2008 Fully clouded straw colored pour.  Punchy tang of pilsener malt aroma.  Grainy, honey glazed, candied almond and dough primaries.  A pleasant, floral-herbal framing dries it up a bit with a feathery, earthy touch that carries some lavender, musk and meadowy freshness.  Lovely.  
Spectacularly clean flavorsome body.  Vanilla dipped pears, bananas, and apricots sparkling in the chewiest, doughiest, softest gorgeous balance of malt.  Again, as in the aroma, the herbal and floral essences so fresh and pure tend to introduce a vibrant, glowing meadow-like freshness thats pretty breathtaking.  Rindy, zesty citrus touches provide a gritty edge.  Doughiness again at mid palate.  Smooth.  Crackery, bitter sesame seed really pushes the dusty blend of pils malt and warm yeasts. 
Yeast introduces an adhesive like element reminiscent of a the yeasty remnant of houbblon chouffe, but its better contained in this perfectly round construction of malt.  Hops still lively but calmed.
Light-medium body is taut and refreshing, though bolstered by an inarguable malty depth.  Dry, refreshing apricot sweetness in a long finish that layers an aromatic rosy essence that bitterly glows.  So fresh.

Big floral and citrus hop smell with grass, oranges and grapefruit along with a nice spice kick as well.  Sweet, light bready malt aroma in the background which balanced out the bitterness of the hop smell.  Subtle hop bitterness up front but not over-the-top which gives way to a mild malty sweetness.  Touch of coriander and pepper spice up the taste a little before the slight lemony tart bitterness finishes the deal.  Mouthfeel is super crisp and clean and perfect for a warm spring evening.  Solid carbonation in there as well.  This is a supremely drinkable pale and perfectly refreshing on a hat afternoon.  Highly recommended.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

992,"2007-12-04",3.9,"Pours with an initially quite frothy, three-finger thick, pale off-white colored head that leaves some nice lacing on the sides of my tulip glass & even recedes with some structured peaking to it.  As I pour the brew a touch of light struck hop scent reaches my nose, nothing too bad & hopefully it will dissipate.  My hope is confirmed when I finally get to exploring the aroma of this brew; it has a solid grassiness to it (influenced by both hop and pale grains), a fruity citrus character (lychee, apricot, candied tangelo peel) and a nice pale grain driven character of biscuits, fresh crushed soda crackers and an appetizing bread-like aroma.  This has a really nice appetizing aroma; I really like the mix of the bread-like malt aromatics (the dominant note perhaps), grassy hop / grain notes and the soft, yet persistent super hop fruit character.

Light feeling as it hits the tongue & it has a nice, prickly, slight foamy carbonation to it.  Quite dry tasting, but just a touch of sweetness that seems to be accentuated by the fruity hop notes.  A nice, substantial pale malt character builds in intensity as it moves towards a dry, biscuit-like / soda cracker grain character that lingers on in the finish.  Oh yeah, it is pretty hoppy too.  A persistent, mouth coating bitterness is noticeable from the get go & it lingers on into a long, biting finish.  While quite dry, some of  the fruit / citrus notes characteristic of the American hops definitely still come through; flavors of kumquats, aromatic, dried apricots, piquant Curacao orange zest and tangelo peel are all noticeable.  There is also a grassy undercurrent that is accentuated by both the malt and hop usage.  The yeast character supplies a light tartness, some esters / phenolics that definitely accentuates the grassy notes in the beer, a sort of cotton-mouth thing ; really this seems like a nice rustic Saison-type yeast here, though at times it can be hard to pick it out.

This beer is very drinkable, the 750ml bottle just seems to be disappearing.  I could perhaps wish for a little more yeast complexity, but really the ample hop & great malt character wouldnt come through nearly as well.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

992,"2007-10-04",4.4,"2007 750mL bottle freshly imported in to the States, drunk all to myself on 9/26/07Gently-hazed, perfectly bottle conditioned appearance, with a lemon-lime tinted golden body and a large, rocky, white head that shows plentiful lacing.Wonderfully invigorating and refreshing hops in the nose still leave room to catch the clean, but very aromatic Orval yeast esters.  The hops burst all over the nose, some shooting straight up the sinuses in a perky citric fashion (tangerines, mainly), and others supporting the aroma in a more juicy, lush way (peaches, pears, nectarines).  Ample bitterness, as well, but its not too much, of course.  And of course, the malt...It backs the hops well, adding fair amounts of telltale pils malt honey and vanilla notes, but allows itself to be lessened in importance by the aforementioned bitterness and additional peppery hop notes.  High strength, very lasting.  No flaws, of course.The flavor dosent disappoint, in the least, with a stronger showing from the malt, leaving some sticky honey and cookie suggestions to be (mostly) dispersed by grassy and fruity hop notes (tangerine, apple, lilac, lemon zest).  Very supple malt body, with tight, engaging carbonation.  Some light cracker-like malt notes interrupt the softness of the texture, and on the end, some excess honey sweetness seems to build up ever so slightly along with lots of grassiness.  Minor, minor complaints and had I not had a near perfect bottle of Taras Boulba the next night, I would have hardly said a word.  Still world class, but I prefer the bone-dryness and singular peppery hop character of Taras to this one, which might have a touch of excess hop bitterness on account of its use of American hops.A side-by-side with Taras is, of course, in order.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

992,"2007-08-07",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2007 Cloudy orange body with soft yellow hues, sediment stirring within. Pretty lacing is imparted by a mostly diminishing white head, very creamy while it lasts. The nose is lightly sweet and very yeasty. Each inhalation has loads of grassy hops at its core. Notes of lemon, honeydew melon, vanilla, orange peel and coriander all linger above the spicy yeastiness. toasted grains are plentiful and buttery. The aroma is rounded out by pepper and alcohol notes. The flavor is nicely balanced, medium levels of sweetness pair nicely with ample hoppy bitterness. Acidity is high but complimentary. Lemon and coriander notes still succeed in arriving ahead of copious yeast. The ethanol notes in the flavor are very spicy. Peppery tasting yeast only adds to this conundrum. Finishes exceedingly warming, quite bitter and moderately acidic, lemon and grain notes lingering briefly before succumbing to the final wave very spicy yeastiness. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, softly though vigorously carbonated, balanced and pleasant. Alcohol warming is very potent though, for such a low alcohol beer, and detracts from what would otherwise be a sessionable belgian ale.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The flavor was pils malts, fruity esters, lemon grass, grass, doughy malts, and funky yeast byproducts. Mouthfeel was full, the highpoint of the beer.

The aroma is sweet and very yeasty, and the flavor is sweet yeasty with notes of spices and citrus on a malty background, the yeastyness lingers in the end. Nice - Ive been looking forward to this ever since I saw the ratings from ZBF and I was not disappointed.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Dominating grassy flavor, dry and a bit biding with a sweet subnote. Dry bitter end.

Zythos 06. Light yellow with a corney aroma. The head is durable enough to last most of the way. Taste is more corn but bland hops and fresh grains dont do much to make this more than average at best.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"

992,"2005-09-24",4.1,"I hate rating after TAR, it feels like I should just say ""what he said, kinda with a lower rating"". Anyway, I had this on tap at the Dilly Deli with TAR, MAP and JCW. Had no idea what a special treat I was getting at the time. Cloudy with a disappearing billowy head. Tons of sharp lemon, orange peel and yeast. A lot of dense, bright and crisp hop flavor but nothing that screams IPA. Definitely refined in every aspect. Slightly spritzy mouthfeel. Lasting herbal and doughy finish with echoes of orange essence. Tasty.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
992,"2005-09-10",4.3,"Draft: Deep golden. Thin film of head yields abundant white lace. Tantalizing scents of perfumey hops, lemon zest, lavender, fennel, and white pepper. Semi-prickly carbonation, but richly creamy and soft. Rustically flavored, charged with an herbal-laced sharpness, yet pillow-soft with yeast, mandarin oranges,  and toasted dough. Peach fuzz bitterness gently scrapes the tongue and accentuates the dryness. Sassy yeast character displays some mustiness and a hint of bubblegum, but the doughy aspects are much more evident, which film the tongue and highlight the peppery hop sting. Dry, rife with spicy phenols, and highly appetizing as a result. Very little brett, however. Possesses just enough fruitiness to deepen the bodys hardness. Dry finish with an equal dose of lavender and white pepper topped with a dainty interplay of spicy hops, sassy yeast spice, and lingering doughy malts. I was hoping for more brett, but the yeast is still plenty herbal and characterful. So fun and uplifting.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
992,"2005-09-09",4.2,"On tap at Dilly Deli.  This was quite a suprise.  Slightly spicy floral aroma and a strong yellow color.  Flavor has some very pleasant sweet hop presence.  Palate comes off as sticky then rolls back into the throat with a bitter smooth dry feel.  This was a really fine belgian, considerably more hoppy than expected, and very delicious.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"
992,"2005-08-31",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2007 On tap @ the Dilly Deli.  This has been the best beer Ive had this summer.  Light gold color, translucent with a white foamy head.  Looks a lot like a pilsner.  Aroma of fruit, yeast, spice(pepper) and hops.  The bite in this beer reminded me a bit of Oval.  The citrusy flavors were more of an undertone to the spiceness.  Finish was slightly dry, with the hops lingering until the ""bitter end"".  Excellent beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"

992,"2005-07-29",4.5,"Pale golden, nice white filmy head lasts until the end. Exquisite fresh citrus nose, boastful dry tangerine, marmalade, floral amarillos, delicate hay and gentle belgian yeast. Light, almost crisp pils malts, slightly biscuity, but the hops dominate, I’m told they are of 3-4 different varieties, the aroma ones being all american. It is fairly hoppy, could be a Saison with american hops. A gentle herbal tartness procures extra balance on top of an awe-inspiring ease to drink by big sips. Plentiful hay harvest. Heavy citrus component, marrying with the saisonish funky yeast like a natural. Light-medium body, excellent mouth-cleaning carbonation, impressive balance. This blends together the liveliness of the best hoppy american ales with the charming rural Ardennes yeast character. Certainly one of the best summer beers anywhere and anywhen.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

992,"2005-07-10",3.8,"Bottled (beer #10) at the Croydon Draught Beer Festival. This looks like a new beer from Rulles, and a very good one. As the turnover of draught beers was a bit slow, we found ourselves drinking a number of the bottled beers that were available - principally for take away as they were not chilled at all. Despite the imperfect serving conditions, the Rulles beers nearly stole the show. This one was quite rustic and earthy - almost in a saison style - with some farmyardy hints, zippy orangey hops and a bit of yeasty character. In fact the yeast is very slightly intrusive, hense it loses a mark or two. Dry and noticeably sharp, although manages to be quite soft at the same time. Excellent stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
