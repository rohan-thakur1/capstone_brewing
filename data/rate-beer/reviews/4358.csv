4358,"2006-08-02",3.1,"I was a bit disappointed with this beer. I may had too high of expectations as I was hoping for an Arrogant Bastard or a Wailing Wench.

Appearance: Served a dark brown color mostly opaque with a bit of a cloudy gritty look to it.

Smell: Slightly sour apple and brown sugar aroma.

Taste: *VERY* very sweet! borderline cloying. Granny smith, Werthers Originals candies, and caramel candies are swirled in the extremely malty thick sticky taste. There is only a hint of muted sour / bitter in the finish. Big sweet taste but not balanced and not what I was expecting from an American Strong Ale.

Mouthfeel: Thick and sticky. Like a Wee Heavy style beer. This is not bad, I like a thick heavy beer but not what I was expecting from the style.

Drinkability: I am sorry to say that even one pint glass was a bit much to get through. Pleasant taste but *extremely* heavy.

Hope this is helpful.
Cheers!","Paradise, Pennsylvania, USA","Phatz"
4358,"2006-02-07",3.7,"Drat  Pours a clear brown with a small tan head.  Aroma is of sweet malts of carmel and hints of coffee.  Taste is very light for the look of it.  Has a sweeet overtone and a decent blend.  High alcohol content is hidden well.  Has a cool finish which is difficult to describe but is good.  This was my favorite at the brew pub.","Perkasie, Pennsylvania, USA","Birdiebeagle"
4358,"2005-06-29",3.6,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a rich brown color with a thick tan head. Initial flavor is malty, however, a few seconds later comes a wash of sweetness with a definite alcohol presence. I understand there is a 2 pint maximum at the brewery on this one, which I think is smart. A very enjoyable beer","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
4358,"2005-04-08",3.6,"on tap at bcbc, a sweet malty nose, caramel tones, some spices.  body was a deep brown color with white lacing.  flavor was rich with malts, caramel flavor with hints of chocolates.  there is an odd tangy bite to the end of this, almost like an ipa tang but coming from a full body beer, it was odd.  a very good brew, the abv doesnt make an impression, which made it very easy to drop down a pint or two after the sampler was gone.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
4358,"2005-03-19",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2005 This beer is very malty and it reminds me of port, except with less alcohol. Because it has 8% alcohol, they wont sell it outside of the tap. That is a shame because it is very well balanced, a great beer for cold winter nights and it has a nice finish to it. But I dont blame Trip one bit for not wanting kids in our area to have this in a keggar. I detect shades of caramel and apple in this beer but its not overly sweet. This beer is the reason I keep going to Barley Creek.","East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","JFURYCAT"

4358,"2004-03-30",4.0,"Very strong malt flavor, and well hidden alcohol.  Dark amber in color with a good head and good lacing.  Very hoppy and malty.  Barley Creek is a gorgeous brewpub in a gorgeous location, with great food and great beers.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

4358,"2003-10-01",3.4,"Had this at the 2003 GABF. Smells somewhat of hops but mostly roasted malt. Appearance is dark brown almost black. Flavor is mostly dark chocolate/coffee but weak and thin.","Orland Park, Illinois, USA","lemonlovr"
4358,"2003-06-12",2.8,"tap - brown red with decent head.  rather thin and non-distinctive. I could not discern the
cascade hops which I usually detect w/o problem.","Upstate, New York, USA","1more4dessert"
