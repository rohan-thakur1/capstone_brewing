2184,"2016-10-10",4.1,"Picked a Bonner up while visiting The Hop Grenade in Concord, CA. Ive had a couple others from HA and damn do they make some fine beers. Dark amber pour with a slight white head. Malty caramel nose. Perfect balance of roasted caramel, just a touch of bitterness and a dry finish with a full mouthfeel. Really good.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"

2184,"2014-11-11",3.9,"Bomber, cheers Bob! Pours a shiny amber with substantial white head. Complex nose with rich malts -- caramel, almost a touch of chocolate, light smoke, fresh bread. Taste is balanced with mild bitterness, sweet malt quality that dries out cleanly, a bit of hops. Drink pretty full-bodied for the ABV and leaves a long-lasting impression of the elegant, well-crafted brew it is. Needless to say, Im a fan.","Valley Village, California, USA","Ontape"

Fine creamy caramel malt aromas..Toffee and Orkney Fudge..malty and good.
Smooth easy taste.. caramel malts and a touch of grassy hop but its so smooth., there is a little rauch in the back but it helps balance the maltiness.
Good thick yet easily swallowed palate..

2184,"2014-10-20",3.3,"Bottle, bottled on 09/25/2014. Pours clear deep orange, medium creamy off-white head, dissipates fairly quickly leaving nice residual and nice lacing. Aroma is light grain, bready malts, a bit of caramel. Flavor is light plus sweet, light bitter, malty and a bit grassy, some floral tea, a bit of acidity. Medium body, high carbonation. Solid representation of a style that is generally not my thing.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2184,"2014-09-30",3.8,"The beer is bright amber. A warm, inviting glass. Fairly cloudy and glowy in the light. Medium head of off-white foam. Decent retention and lacing.

Taste is noticeably hoppy, slight bitterness, some malty sweetness and nice caramel and light fruit flavors. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Very nice. I drank this back-to-back with the Ayinger Oktoberfest; the Heater Allen is hoppier than the Ayinger, and not as sweet.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Brentv"
2184,"2014-09-27",3.8,"22 oz. bomber from Star Grocery. It pours a nice clear deep golden color with a huge pillowy white head. The aroma is herbal tea with some honey, lemon, intense florals and background notes of sweet and toasty malt. The flavor is more of the same hop forward lemon tea, florals and a great velvety malt quality that ties it all together. Smooth on the palate and very quaffable. A very interesting and tasty Oktoberfest.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

A; Clear copper color with a gigantic foamy off-white head. Some lacing. 

N: Toffee, a touch of burnt brown sugar, corn, biscuit, and graininess. Hint of clove, peppercorn, and earth.

M: Prickly carbonation. Light body. No trace of alcohol.

O: Doesnt reach the high water mark of Ayinger, but thats a tall task. This is a very different beer, too. Its far more smokey than other Oktoberfests Ive had.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

2184,"2012-09-22",3.9,"Bottle @ The BeerMongers...  Poured mildly clear amber/reddish with a nice forming, eggy, light beige head.  Definitely one of the better American examples of the style. Often times I find Amercan Oktoberfest beers to be buttery, bready, and popcorn like.  This one hit the spot. Clean with some green earthiness and biscuity malt tones.

2184,"2011-10-26",4.1,"Shared tasting with Strykzone vis Facebook Chat.. Got this one at Market of Choice in Ashland, OR.  It poured a clear amber with with good sized yellow tinged off-white head and quite decent lacing. Very attractive.  The nose was malty with ripe fruit, and floral hops. Medium body and mouthfeel as smooth as you can make it.  Like velvet.  The flavor is more malt than hops, but the balance seems perfect. There is some spice in  the finish. This is about as good as an Oktoberfest can get.   This small brewer really know how to make world class lagers.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
2184,"2011-10-06",3.7,"22 oz. bottle from Hayduke.  We had it together via facebook chat.  I rolled my bottle and it poured very hazy tea color.  A nice thick one finger layer of orange hued foam and lots of bubbles floating up to supplant it.  The aroma was nice.  It had spices, fruit, malt, and is subtle.  The flavor featured all of those.  The fruit came from some softer hops and reminded me of what is often found in Pale Ales.  Apples were also tasted.  The spices were nice.  The malt was the backbone.  This is as good as any Oktoberfest I have had.  Thanks Ron!","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
2184,"2011-02-16",3.6,"750mm bottle from: mainbrew.com

Visual: clear medium amber. Medium 

Nose: Smoke, and mild toasted malts.

Palate: Medium smokiness, medium malts with a touch of sweetness and toastiness, very smooth and round.

Conclusion:  A good introduction to a smoke, or , Rauch beer. It is not as smoky as many authentic Rauch beers from Bamberg Germany, however if youre on the fence when it comes to smoky beers this one is the one to try. Outside of the smoke character it is quite clean. In addition it is an all around great beer that satisfies the palate without weighing you down to heavy.","West Coast, Oregon, USA","authenticmead"
2184,"2010-12-07",3.7,"Tasted from a 22oz bottle, thanks Chris.  Pours clear amber-orange with a thick white head that leaves very nice lace.  The nose is dominated by hickory smoke with a bit of toasted malt, yeast, and earthy hops underlying.  The flavor is not quite as smoky (although it is present) with the malts shining through and the hops are very light.  The body is light with lively carbonation and a long smoky finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

2184,"2009-09-29",3.4,"22 oz bottle on the cheap (3.49) from Market of Choice. Poured a clear copper with a one inch white head and solid lacing. Aroma was hefty on caramel malt with some earth and pine hops thrown in for balance. The flavor was light and refreshing with some caramel, nuttiness and some light grain and a hop finish. Solid beer, going to try and get into more Oktoberfest brews while the season is upon us.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","Beardface"

2184,"2008-10-23",3.7,"22. Thanks, BVC! Pours a deep, grainy, nearly opaque dark copper, heavily burnished. Definitely an autumnal color, reminds you of piles of wet leaves that have been there for a while. Big nutty sweet caramel biscuit and tea nose. Some nice sweet brown bread there as well. Rich, somewhat dense, very satisfying but clean lager body. Almost has an ale-y heft to it at first that makes it seem like it might be flat, but it’s just a big lager. All the sweet notes from the nose return for a nice and satisfying mid-palate. No great roar of power, and definitely nothing out of balance, but still some strength and a bit of daring in the intensity and variety of flavors. Not usually a style I walk too many times around the bar for, but this one’s a champ.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2184,"2008-10-15",3.8,"Bottle from Belmont Station. Pours copper, great clarity, soft off-white head. Rich malts up front, long warming caramel flavor, soft earthy hop finish. Fairly bitter for an oktoberfest, but all in all comes out very nice.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
2184,"2008-10-15",3.6,"22 oz bottle courtesy of DA.  Pour is hazed orange copper with a one inch white head the falls pretty quick with no lacing.  Aroma of apple sweet maltiness with some nice sharp acidic sourness.  Fresh nose.  Taste is the sour, sweet maltiness to begin, with an earthy grassiness that picks up midway through.  Nice transition of flavors and good complexity.  The aftertaste is bitter and also a bit sour.  Palate is medium-thin, quite drinkable.  Nice Oktoberfest.  Thanks for sending this one my way Derek!","Kansas, USA","theisti"
