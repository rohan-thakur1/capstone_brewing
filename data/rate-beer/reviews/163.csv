There is a lot of peanut butter and chocolate to go along with the coffee. It's just what's advertised. Really good. There isn't little lactose on the back end, but for the most part it's like Reese's Puffs with coffee. Really good. The flavor is much of the same. There is a light lactose but the flavors are a little light. There is a peanut butter and some chocolate. The coffee takes on a little bit of an acidity here. The mouth feel is thin and light with a roasted coffee that lingers with a milky chocolate and peanut butter dust. Not bad, but it could be better

Taste is immediately peanur butter, chocolate, and then coffee and roastiness kicks in. All well balanced. Although I think the coffee detracts from the peanut butter and chocolate. Making me wonder if this is a peanut butter chocolate coffee they are using. I feel the roastiness is just a touch too much for the subtle and coy peanut butter flavor. The flavors are well expressed and dont come across as artificial as other peanut butter beers do. Also, very nice to see this at a low, sessionable 5.5% and not some 10+% impy stout. mouthfeel is a touch thin, but Ive experienced that with a lot of coffee beers.

As the jet black ale hits your tongue, the coffee and a slight bit of peanut butter become apparent, but theyre quickly lost to an extremely disappointing sense of watery nothingness. This beer, in both appearance and aroma, promises richness - on that front it simply doesnt follow through.

The aroma offers up caramel, rich dark roasted coffee, a bit of toffee infused peanut butter and nearly burnt malts. Great aroma. The taste is similar with dark roasted malts to modestly burnt malts, highly roasted coffee beans and some smooth peanut butter. Yummy.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

I didnt taste peanut butter till the finish, which I think was a perfect place to be. Nice job. Wish I brought my growler.","Conneaut, Ohio, USA","beergodd1"

Tons of coffee and creamy peanut butter aroma with roasted malt and chocolate.  Flavor is heavy on the coffee up front, but as this beer warms it takes on a creamy body and the peanut butter shows itself well.  Loved it.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
163,"2011-11-27",4.1,"Sampled from a growler brought to the Black Friday tasting.  Dark mahogany pour with crimson edges and nice latte head.  Aroma is divine.  Lots of Nestle Quik, Hersheys syrup, and Skippy peanut butter along with roasted coffee, vanilla, and caramel.  Almost like a double dipped Reeses PB cup...more chocolate than nuttiness although it is present.  Ample carbonation...a little thin but still thick enough to stick.  Really great start to a great night!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"

Pours a darker, mostly opaque, cola stout pour with reddish brown edges and topped with a fluffy light beige head tha eventually reduces to a thin film... Aroma is creme brûlée-esque that has a large coffee vanilla expression with much less of a peanut butter presence but still a nice semi-sweet desert like feel to it. Some nuttiness surfaces but never quite develops to a full fledged peanut butter nature...flavor continues on a very similar wavelength with creme brûlée toffee vanilla notes with a nutty aspect to it that meshes quite well. Medium bodie xwith a medium level of carbonation. Tasty for sure and was pleasantly surprised. Kind of impressed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

It has not held up so well+++ Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a somewhat thick black color with a medium sized dark brown head that lingered and left great lacing.

163,"2011-09-03",4.1,"Growler from Veldrid just because hes a frigging great guy.  Hope the wedding was awesome.  Pour is black with a great, strong tan/brown head.  Two fingers of head after two weeks in the growler.  Not bad, eh?  Nose is massively cocoa/chocolate and coffee.  No doubt about the cocoa/coffee connection here.  Smells like a cold mocha coffee drink from the cafe.  Taste is cold coffee and lots of chocolate and cocoa.  Bitter and sweet, and creamy too.  The only disappointment for me is the lack of obvious peanut butter.  I desperately want to try a porter/stout that has the actual saltiness of peanut/butter.  Finish is light like a porter, not rich and gooey like a stout.  Love this brew.  Thanks a ton Veldrid for sending me this gem.  I wish more people would randomly send me free growlers of world-class brew, just for answering a question on a thread.  This is why I love Ratebeer.","San Diego, California, USA","Lagunitasfan"

163,"2011-06-17",3.5,"Thanks to jale for sharing this. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass at our Anniversary Party pre-event.

Pours a very dark brown color with a good tan head that persisted for a bit. Slight lacing as it went down into a thin cap. The nose is just as it was described -- a good amount of chocolate with peanut butter backing. Really interesting. Some mild malt presence in the background bringing some roast forward. The flavor doesnt hit as hard on the peanut butter, though it is there. Flavor is mostly chocolate and roast. Dark chocolate. Medium body and good carbonation. Solid brew, Id be glad to have it again.

163,"2011-06-14",4.0,"Growler from my in-laws.  The first thing I noticed was the peanut butter that had settled on the bottom of the growler after it sat for a day or so.  The aroma and flavor are pretty spot on.  Its pretty much a melted down Reeses peanut butter cup with a hit of coffee.  I think the peanut butter actually stands out the most to me.  The one downfall is the thin body.   Overall though, an incredibly smooth, unique brew that Im really glad I got to try.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"

163,"2009-07-16",3.5,"7/13/2009:  Finally!  I have missed this beer the last two years because they ran out early, but not this time...  Willoughby Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter is dark cola brown/almost black in color with a small tan-colored head.  It has lots of coffee and cream in both the aroma and flavor.  There is a little bit of a Reeses Pieces quality as well as some other roasty notes in the flavor, but thats about it.  This beers medium body is a touch thin, but makes it easy to put down several pints in quick succession.  I am disappointed with this beer.  I was really hoping for the peanut butter to be there, but it really just isnt - at all.  More or less this is a just a coffee porter that is somewhat one-dimenstional with a great name that almost makes your mouth water.  Oh well, maybe Southern Tier or Stone or somebody like that will actually do a real PEANUT BUTTER beer one of these years!

This was the current release from the small batch offerings that caught my eye.  As soon as I saw the name I knew it was worth trying no matter how strange it may taste.  After all once you have had the Chocolate Donut beer or Southern Tiers Choklat how can you not seek out some billing itself as peanut buttery?  Unfortunately it didnt quite live up to expectations though it was a solid release.
Aroma / Appearance - The fluid black body looked like your typical porter.  The nose was of strong black coffee blended with milk and creamer.  A hint of chocolate was evident but just barely.  If you like coffee porters and stouts this would be right up your alley.
Flavor / Palate - Day old watery black coffee filled my mouth after the first sample.  A trace of peanut butter swirled down my throat but it was short lived.  The dominant characteristic here is the coffee; this may be a spinoff of the PDG Porter that is perpetually on tap.  In the end it was a little too one-dimensional for my liking.  You may see things differently.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
