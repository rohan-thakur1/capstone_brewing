The look: Black body topped by a medium beige head leaving good lacing
In long: A whole lotta malts in this one.  A little lactic.  A little grape juice and dried dark fruits.  Medium roastiness level.  Despite its full body the problem with this beer is that it really wasnt tasty, I had to focus to pick-up flavours.  Not sweet but certainly not very dry.
