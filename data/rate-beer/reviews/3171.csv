The flavor has a distinct fruityness to deal with the rice, and then the alcohol kicks in adding an extra dimension. Well, that might lead you to think this is a complex and superb sake, but I dont feel it that way. Slighlty warming on the palate. A drinkable one indeed, but not worth a detour. 111105","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
