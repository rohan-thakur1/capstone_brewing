I am a home brewer and know that bottles do not do justice to any brew so I will give this beer another try and reevaluate my score at that time. The hops seemed to have lost all aroma and were flat out just bitter, as if the hops had been in the freezer for a while.","California, USA","robsohoppy"

1322,"2013-01-21",4.0,"Its strange that the Scottish (not ""Scotch"") style hasnt really caught fire in the American craft beer scene. If done right, these beer have it all: plenty of malty sweetness balanced with hop bitterness and a hint of smoke. Theyre versatile as they work great as stand-alone beverages or accompaniment with a meal. Well, at least thats how Id describe Hangar 24 Hullabaloo Winter Beer. 

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Dark, murky, cranberry/maroon colored body. Forms a large, off-white, frothy head which laces and retains really well.

Smell: Sweet, dark malts with a hint of dark fruit and a faint trace of smoke.

Taste: Ill admit I was rather hesitant going into Hangar 24 Hullabaloo Winter Beer, as Im not usually a fan of Scottish Ales. But one sip into it I knew this beer wasnt like most Ive experienced. Theres a much bigger taste profile here thats both robust, complex and perfectly balanced. It has that classic taste of bready, slightly fruity maltiness in the English style. Theres pronounced bitterness through the middle - a nice combination of astringency and piney, resiny hop character. The ending is the best part as theres a strong burst of caramel sweetness followed by semi-sweet chocolate and slight bitterness just before it fades away. Theres a smoky taste riding shotgun the entire time, but its nice and subtle and doesnt distract from the main palate. 

This is a really tasty palate, and a versatile one as I could see this beer working well in a variety of situational pairings: with a meal, with cheese, with dessert or as dessert. Take your pick.

Drinkability: Thankfully, Hangar 24 Hullabaloo Winter Beer drinks like a bigger beer than it actually is. You dont tend to get this much flavor out of 6.5% ABV. Its big enough that one serving satisfies, but light enough that it doesnt overwhelm you. Its smooth and soft all around with an almost creamy-like texture but distinct carbonation to give it some energy. The aftertaste is a little dry, but its easily tolerable.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
1322,"2013-01-08",3.4,"Bottle.  Hazy brown pour with a slick of white foam.  Aroma is toasty nuts, roasted grain, light hop bitterness, and toffee.  Taste is light roast, nuts, perhaps some minimal peat, and some hop bitterness in the finish.  Watery mouthfeel.  Not bad.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
1322,"2012-12-29",2.8,"Tap at the brewery. Clear deep amber pour. Beige foam. Nose is malty, raw, caramel, fairly neutral. Taste is soapy, dusty, dry, quite tannic. Papery finish. Eh. Spotty lace.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1322,"2012-12-22",3.2,"On tap at the source. Pours with a crystal clear bronze hued body with a medium sized off-white head. Aromas are malty, lightly earthy, toasty, medium caramel, and a bit of a distracting roast. Low ester. Flavors are quite roasty for the style, slightly watery, medium malt, toasted, caramel. Medium carbonation. Misses the mark a touch for me.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1322,"2012-12-13",3.9,"Aromas of molasses, wood and cream.   A very light off-white head on a crystal clear copper/amber body.   Although the appearance of this beer is clear and light, the body is substantial.  Light toffee and toasted/smoky wood flavors hit first followed by a creamy milk/bittersweet chocolate thats really interesting.   A well defined bitterness with earthy and grassy qualities keeps the sweetness in check and balances everything out nicely.  That bitterness hangs on through the end and leaves a dryness on the tongue along with the toasted/smoky, woody notes.   Really nice winter ale.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
1322,"2012-12-13",3.9,"12oz bottle, no date from Olive Tree Market in OB for $1.89.  Clear copper brown with a half finger beige head, fading to a swirling creamy film before long. Clean toasty malt nose up front with nutty caramel, light herbal and earthy hops--seems wonderfully balanced so far. Flavor seemed to add a touch of woody hops, some yeast character. The caramel is still there, but again, minimal sweetness. Dry finish, bitterness peaked at a 2-3, earthy. Medium body with low carbonation. Quite tasty.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
1322,"2012-12-11",3.5,"Aromas of oak and herbs. Deep copper in appearance. Flavors of smokey caramel, oak, herbs and oats. Subtle pines and hops on the finish. Overall, pretty basic ale with smokey characteristics. Id give this a C+ rating.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
1322,"2012-12-09",3.6,"Truth in labeling.  This is a nice Scottish ale with an American hop presence.  But you get both flavors, not just one or the other.  A nice choice for a SoCal holiday season.  Some caramel notes blend into the bitterness nicely.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"

Flavor has a hint of chocolate, then light caramel, mild roastiness, and enough bitterness to make it drinkable. Its flavorful, but far from imperially so.

1322,"2012-11-19",3.6,"This review is from the bottle, upon initial pour the liquid is clear with an amber hue.  There is minimal head and the aroma is light and earthy with a malty sweet smell.
