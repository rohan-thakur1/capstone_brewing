1177,"2014-12-10",4.6,"From notes. This was shared at a tasting put on by @mikem409 on November 7. The pour is a beautiful golden amber color with an off-white head that falls down quickly, leaving some good lace. The aroma is beautiful. There is a great fruitiness with orange, lemon, mango, grapefruit. There is a nice movement through a tropical hoppiness and into a floral hoppiness. There is a little pine resin on the back end, which is just a great balance with the hops. The flavor is a little woody, but there is the blast of floral hops and a great citrus presence to go with the piney resin. The mouth feel is just great. Thick and clingy while coming off as light and airy. The aftertaste is beautifully hoppy and full of resin, and a great lingering citrus note with absolutely no detectable alcohol which is extraordinarily impressive for a beer at almost 11%","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1177,"2014-10-20",4.2,"Bottle: Thanks, Jason. Another big Alpine want of mine. Slightly cloudy & unfiltered with a rustic look, amber in color & capped with an off-white, almost gray tinted head that fades quickly. The aroma is immediately captivating & reminds me strongly of Hill Farmsteads Ephraim. Sticky & juicy fruits gushing from wall to wall; mango, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, both citric & tropical all at once with a vibrant, oily & earthy dankness overcasting the entire parade. Light perfume, zesty herbal notes & faint pine with an undertow of inherent sweetness that seems akin to dextrose, giving off a nice sugar cookie vibe. The taste includes a larger presence of spicy & earthy hoppage, though not a bad thing. Might be from the oak chips, too, as theres a strong woodsy, almost forestry thing happening that really makes this unique. Big floral notes, toffee drizzled cookie dough, sticky mango flesh, overripe pineapple, grapefruit, bitter tangerine, all leading into a conclusively herbal, earthy, fruity, semi-sweet & semi-bitter finish. Oily & sticky, lacquering the palate with a fresh coat of dank pine sap & hemp oil. Cant believe this shit is 11% ABV... WHERE IS THE ALCOHOL?

Poured a caramel, honey, murky color with three fingers of khaki cream rocky head. Lots of various streams of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Great layered lacing along the sides of the glass. Excellent retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 4.40)

Smelled hops galore - Citra, spicy Simcoe, floral, grapefruit, tropical, mango, grapefruit rind, resin, faint Cascade and caramel. Some spicy bitterness late, but didnt taste anywhere near 11 percent ABV. (Smell - 4.35)

Wow to the taste. Pretty damn smooth for 11 percent ABV was my first thought. Not as potent as the smell. Citra, floral, light resin, bitter grapefruit, tropical, mango, light pineapple (wishful?), Columbus and light Cascade. (Taste - 4.45)

Medium body. Creamy-to-oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, bitter, but still smooth finish. Warming late. The 11 percent ABV is very well-hidden. This was the best part of the beer. (Feel - 4.69)

A pretty damn good beer. Probably didnt quite live up to my hype, but glad I have another after this. (Overall - 4.44)

Poured to New Belgium globe.

A: Pours a clear golden ale with superb clarity. Fine white single finger head dissipates in a minute or so to leave a thick sheet of meringue foam. Consistent carbonation evident through the ale. Spider web lacing on glass.

S: Pine, sweet alcohol, bubble gum, grapefruit, citrus rinds. Alcohol a hint more evident than I would prefer, but nonetheless, yummy.

T: See above. Add bitterness so acute the glands behind my jaw. Just what Ive been looking for in an Impy IPA lately. Been through Hopslam, Pliny, etc. This is fantastic! I think I might prefer it.

M: Medium body, medium carbonation. Clearly slicks the palate while cold. As it warms, the body of my mouth is dried. Pleasant.

D: This is among the best, no question. I think the hype matches this beer appropriately. Worth seeking, but not a 1200 miles journey (or global: see PtY).

This beer is really interesting - it honestly drinks like a hoppy pale ale other than the oily mouthfeel.

A: Pours a clear amber color with a nice and thick pure white head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to a thin cap and thick collar. Sticky sheets of lace are left down the glass. Looks great.

S: Sugar covered grapefruit, some bitter pith, a touch of malty sweetness and sticky fruit all fill the nose. There is a touch of booze in there which I would suspect being 11%. There is a touch of wood from the oak chips and slight flowery pine to it as well. Theres a ton going on.

T: Wow, definitely drinks a lot lighter than how it smells and how one would guess. Sticky sweet grapefruit, some tropical melon, and sweet sugar cookie malts all hit up front. Candied orange peel with a mild orange pith bitterness. The slight boozy note from the nose is non-existent here.

M: Medium to light bodied with a nice medium plus carbonation level. Sticky sweet citrus fruit finish.

O: I though this was going to be a big and boozy hop bomb when I first smelled it, but it really toned down in the taste and it turned in a lighter drinking tropical fruit and sweet malt bundle of deliciousness. Very excited to have gotten a chance to try my first Alpine IPA. Thanks again Eric!

Poured a golden orange color with a huge white head. Faint aroma with notes of light lemon, citrus, and grapefruit. Taste is grapefruit, stale bread, citrus, caramel, and floral hops.

1177,"2012-08-27",4.5,"A-- Poured a clear Orange amber color. Little carbonation showing. Half finger of white head, Just splotches of lacing on the sides. 

S--- Oaked candied orange that changed to fresh cut grass, mango, grapefruit, orange, and pine. Just a smell I could not get enough of. bended very well. 

T-- Oak, citrus, and pure hoppiness to another level. Really liked how the flavors changed through drinking the beer. Got waves of mango, pineapple, orange, and lemon.

M-- Slick, oily and coating. Long lasting flavo. Great body to this. Reminds me of Sculpin from the brewery but with better hidden ABV. Great touches of oak. 

O-- Insane beer. Just insane. Complex as heck and reminds me of good SBs wine wise. Well constructed beer and a must for any 3X IPA lover.","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"
1177,"2012-08-10",4.3,"Bottles and draft at Toronado last May. This review is obviously the draft version since on tap ipas are far superior. Poured a slightly clearish golden color with medium white head and excellent sticky lacing. Aromas of pure dank piney hops, grapefruit, and oak. Aroma was an easy 10. Taste is very spicy, oily hop resins with some light malts and a little caramel sweetness. Full bodied double ipa. Very good, but a little too hot, Pure hoppiness was noticeably better and more balanced and the Nelson skeeted on both of them. Cheers.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
1177,"2012-08-09",4.2,"Bottle shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul!

Im pretty stoked about revisiting this brew, as I hear the recipe has been changed and the beer is much improved.

The beer is transparent and light orange in color, with a thick, white head that coats the glass with lacing. The aroma is not kidding around. A powerful dose of hops and citrus in the nose and taste buds - no doubt this is an imperial IPA. Absolutely delicious with a great feel. This is 11% abv?!? Impressive. The finish is dry and filled with tangy, bitter hop goodness. This beer is highly drinkable, at least until I try to stand up. What an enormous improvement from the previous batch I tasted. Highly recommended.

1177,"2012-03-01",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/16/2011.  Poured from a growler into a pint glass.

Exponential pours a pale golden yellow color, slightly hazy in the center. A smooth white head retains nicely and leaves chunky lace down the glass. Lots of reaffirming carbonation rises up from the bottom of the glass.

A ton of hops burst into my nose; grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, pine, and herbal aromas, in that order.

A burst of light malty sweetness, then hops for the duration of each sip. Citrus hits me first, with caramelized pineapple and candied grapefruit, but there are more pine and herbal notes. 

Creamy, with a bit of crisp carbonation. This has a medium to full body, although I was expecting fuller just from the ABV. Very smooth. The full carbonation keeps the beer fresh and avoids the overly sticky trap some DIPAs fall into.

So smooth, and the alcohol is very well hidden. With a boat load of hops, I could get into quite a few glasses of this.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1177,"2012-02-18",4.5,"The ""Triple IPA"" may not be classified as a real style just yet, but when youve drank as many beers as I have you start to notice variations even within specific niche styles. Usually beers of that style are just carbonated bitter syrup, but Alpine Exponential Hoppiness is quite unique in that its extremely drinkable, tasty, and even refreshing for a beer considering how much of a monster beer it is.

I received a 22oz bottle in a trade with a friend in San Diego (thanks, Ryan!). I split it with a friend. I poured my half into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Typical west coast glowing orange marmalade hue; very cloudy body with only little carbonation visible. Forms a good sized, eggshell colored, creamy froth head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: Like a bag of pure tropical fruit juice concentrate. Plenty of tropical fruit, but dominated by grapefruit and hop flowers. An underlying candy aroma of Sweet Tarts and a touch of honey. 

Taste: When a beer smells like liquid fruit candy it tends to taste the same. Thats the thing about hops - they smell so juicy that sometimes we forget hops are for bittering. As soon as Alpine Exponential Hoppiness hit my tongue the first flavor I got was intense hoppy bitterness. Its slightly dry, but its quickly refreshed by the delicious, authentic fruitiness of the palate. A wave of sweet, sticky, almost syrup-like flavors of mango, guava and grapefruit saturate the palate. 

The finish reverts back to the bitterness with a distinct resin-like flavor and aftertaste. Its also somewhat gummy and a tad astringent (like burnt gum?). A light honey taste also appears alongside the tropical and citrus fruit flavors of the main palate. The only problem is its a tad too sweet, bordering on becoming cloying, although the strong hop presence helps to balance that out. Im not sure of the IBU rating of this beer but would estimate its well over 100. So you get a lot of bitterness and a lot of sweetness simultaneously. This is one of those big IPAs that walks that fine line between intensely flavored and overly-flavored.

Drinkability: The mouthfeel is noticeably thick and a little less carbonated than Id prefer since it hits the tongue with a thud instead of a crisp crackle. Its soft, comfortable, and even borderline creamy which enables it to go down extremely smooth. At 11% ABV youd think there would be a lot of heat and burn, but the booze is nowhere to be found. I didnt even start to feel buzzed until about 20 minutes after drinking my pint. Alpine Exponential Hoppiness is a pretty versatile beer as you can truly enjoy it on its own or match it with a variety of food pairings.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
1177,"2012-02-05",4.1,"Growler, thanks again Austin!  Nice pour, a shade darker than gold with a fast dissapating white head.  Nice lacing too.  Aroma reeks of hops.  Pine, grapefruit and mixed tropical fruit.  A bit of booze on the nose as well.  Fairly full sweet and sticky body.  Flavor is a balance between sweet malt, bitterness and alcohol.  Pine, sweet grapefruit zest, sweet tropical fruits and booze are in the flavor.  The sweetness is present thrOugh most of the sip, but the bitterness at the end balances it out.  The oak is not very noticeable for me.  I like this beer a lot.  Its a nice treat every once in a while.","Pennsylvania, USA","McGrupp612"

All this hoppiness on top of a decent malt backbone with some detectable sweetness. The sharp citrus edge in the aroma makes it wonderful.

The taste is simply amazing, on the tip of the tongue you get a ton of hops that are mellowed out by the oak chips that are added.

1177,"2011-06-21",4.0,"In short: A clean and sugary blonde IPA with a truckload of hops proposing dried fruits and dry yellowed grass.  Excellent, but not top-10 IIPA people make it to be.
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh less than 2 months after bottling.  Early 2011 batch.  Bottle sent to me by DaSilky1 (as a bonus!!!), thank-you so much Todd
The look: Clear golden blonde body topped by a medium white head
In long: Nose is an explosion of citrusy and grassy hops.  If you love IPAs, you love that aroma.  Taste is a hop-head orgasm.  There is a solid malt backbone but with a crackery and dried white bread flavor that doesnt offer much opposition to the hops, and thats fine with me.  Taste is dominated by dried citrus fruits, yellowed grass, fresh mandarins, fresh grapefruits, orange peels, some pine needles.  The sweetness flavor is similar to the white sugary I have when I eat a mix-bag of dried fruits, and thats probably the main disappointing aspect of the beer (sweetness sensation similar to refined white sugar).  I see in the description that it uses oak chips, I didnt pick it up.  No alcohol fumes in the aroma and the beer doesnt feel boozy at first but the more I drank it the more the back of my palate was burning.  But that was to be expected drinking a full bomber of an 11% IIPA as my first beer of the day with a clean palate.  Not the masterpiece I was hoping but still an excellent west-coast IIPA.  Im want to slow down on my drinking, for five minutes I overcame the temptation to open a bomber of beer, so now I think Ive earned that treat.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1177,"2011-06-07",4.1,"Received in a trade with stawn, thanks man.

Poured from a bottle into an arrogant bastard imperial pilsner glass. Beer is amber and slightly hazy, carbonation moderate to high. Forms a good one fingered white head of medium to small bubbles and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass.

Aroma isnt quite as hoppy as I expected but hops are all over it anyway. There is a malt sweetness to the aroma that underpins the mostly pine hop aroma.

Medium body, nice sweetness up front, not as bitter as expected but there is nice sweet fruit flavors throughout the palate. The beer is surprisingly drinkable, there is no heat or detectable alcohol at all in this beer. Second taste, bitterness grows but I think the sweetness is winning overall. When I lifted the glass to my mouth that time I got punched in the face with the hop aroma. The bitterness builds as almost an aftertaste as I drink. I love it though. Good DIPA (although I think my rDev is going to be negative for this review).

3.5 A: Hazy dark yellow color. One and a half fingers of 1/2 frothy, 1/2 creamy head. Average retention and a decent amount of lacing.

4.0 S: Hops arent as strong as I was expecting, but there certainly is more malt. Piney hops foremost with pineapple and grapefruit. There is an underlying oakiness, but nothing to write home about. A little boozy with strong barleywine-esque malts.

4.0 T: A mix of lots of malts and lots of hops. Barleywine style DIPA for sure. Hops are more fruity than they are piney with pineapple and grapefruit stealing the show again. Bitterness (which doesnt seem harsh anyway) is very much softened by the residual malt sweetness. Malts are strong in a neutral way, somewhere between bready and grainy. The pitfall of this brew is that the booziness is a bit too strong. Hopslam, for example, is just as high in ABV, but the alcohol is much better hidden.

4.0 M: Heavier medium body or perhaps even lighter heavy. Good carbonation and reasonably creamy. Lingering hop bitterness and booze on finish.

3.5 D: Pretty good brew. I like maltier DIPAs, but the alcohol is a bit too strong in this one. Still, I was glad to get ahold of this and would buy it occasionally if it were available.

Aroma: The nose is mostly hops (citrus, floral, herbs, and resin), and a little caramel malt

Appearance: It pours a hazy golden-like color with a medium sized off-white head

Flavor: The taste is still rather hoppy, but it has definitely turned a bit sugary 

Palate: The body is medium-full, the mouth feels sticky, and it has a long and dry finish to it

Overall Impression: 
To me, this stuff was really good, even though it wasnt so fresh.  Man would I love to try this stuff fresh!  I bet it is crazy good.  Even not so fresh, I still enjoyed it.  Maybe I was so excited for it that I had it built up in my mind, but I could feel the great IPA craftsmanship coming through even though the beer was clearly beyond its best days.

Pours a nice golden color with a good white head. The hops absolutely dominate the malts in the nose, but its not quite as hoppy as I would have expected. The same is true of the taste, where everything just doesnt blend together as well as it could, and the hops shine through, but only give massive bitterness without as much of the beautiful hoppy taste that I enjoy. Not at all a bad taste, just not as good as I was expecting. The body was medium with moderate carbonation, and drinkability was good for a hop monster, but nothing too great.

1177,"2010-07-10",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2012 A: Pours a dark amber body, with a large, creamy off-white head. Significant retention before crashing down to a respectable skim. Nice ring around the glass with sheet like lacing.

S: Massive bright citric and tropical fruits... grapefruit, orange, pineapple and mango are most notable... a significant undercurrent of alcohol and sweet malts... almost warm glazed donut in character...

T: Incredibly bitter up front with all of the citric hop character from the nose plus some floral and pine as well... lots of sweet bready, bicuity malts... lots of booze shining through the back... this would get a five if the booze and malt sweetness were toned down just a tad.

M: Resinous, yet smooth throughout. Hearty, but not distracting carbonation. Not much of a bite in the finish because of the booze presence.

O: This is one massive brew. If I could describe this beer in one word it would be ""experimental."" Huge huge hops with no attempt at being balanced. A great idea, just pushed it a tad too far. Although, I started eating pretzels during the second half of the bomber and the boozeyness was diminished.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

The resiny component is interesting.  Full bodied, viscous but well carbonated.  The alcohol is warming, but doesnt really come in to play in the flavor.  This was worth the wait.

1177,"2010-05-25",3.8,"Appearance: Transparent copper body with a nice 1 finger white crown that shows some retention and leaves lots of lacing.

Smell: Very Pliny like in the sense that this brew has lots of pineapple and grapefruit notes but not as much pine sap, lots more malt presence, and lots more floral hop smell.

Taste: An initial hop bitterness that opens up to a nice pale malt that blends flawlessly with some great oak notes from the oak chips used in the recipe. The next wave is all citrus hops and once the fruit flavor subsides a strong hop bitterness finishes this one off. Tip of the cap to Alpine for packing this much hop bitterness into a brew and keeping it from tasting astringent. The bitterness is well crafted and really enjoyable. Alpine does add a heavy dose of sugar sweetness to the brew to counterbalance the extreme bitterness and mask the high abv. The sugar sneaks up on you faster than the abv IMHO.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a touch chewy. Decent amount of carbonation (even after the 2 weeks it has been since it was poured) and smooth!

Drinkability: The 10.50% abv and the sugar are the only things holding me back from giving this excellent brew a higher drinkability rating.

Home Run Alpine!

Aroma is sweet caramel, which usually concerns me, but this time Im open minded.  I smell a little booze too, but it doesnt scare me off, quite to the contrary, it gives me a chubby.  Initial palate shot screams ""Sweet, syrupy, English style IPA!""...and all of that is true....yet I still really like it.

S: The nose on this beer is incredibly floral and piney. The hops do not provide as much in the way of citrus as many California IPAs, but this is more than made up for.

T: This is a wonderfully pungent and bitter IPA. There is a fair amount of grapefruit and orange, which is somewhat surprising due to the absence of these fruits in the nose. The finish is incredibly piney and bitter, but also has a noticeable alcoholic heat to it.

M: The body is full, but almost to a point of syrupy. Luckily there is fairly abundant carbonation after the initial pour, but as this begins to die down, things deteriorate a little bit.

Awesome aroma of orange citrus, hops, tropical fruits, pine resin, caramel malts, and grass.  Flavor is nearly as good, with orange and grapefruit citrus, caramel malts, floral and herbal hops, pine, tropical fruits, tea, and resin.  Medium-full bodied, with a mouthfeel that falls between juicy and malty.  Lingering bitter citrus finish.  Truly outstanding DIPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1177,"2010-02-04",3.9,"Bottle picked up @ the brewery.  This one starts out liquid gold but shows lemon around the edges and tangerine and peaches at its core.  Aroma is candied citrus with honey accompanying acidity.  Flavor is much sweeter than expected.  Mango, pineapple, guava, and papaya are all there...exponentially tropical. This one doesnt tear up the palate as many IIPAs do.  I would definitely say the title is deceiving but I was not at all disappointed with the beer itself.  The 11% is masked incredibly well and this would pair well with many dishes.  A really well crafted and enjoyable beer that was quite different than expectations.  Just prepare yourself.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
1177,"2010-02-02",3.9,"22 from South Bay Drugs, first shipment. Props to Joey! Pours a murky dark brown, very muddy looking. Clearly theyve left behind the marketing philosophy that IPAs should look crisp, transparent, and fetching when served on the deck during summer evenings--this is a big, grainy-looking bruiser of an american ale thats here to strap on the brass knuckles and lay into you. Its not here for you to admire how pretty it is while people nod silently at your craft beer acumen. Which is why it gets a 5 for appearance--dense, creamy off-white head, ridiculously thick opaque lacing sheets, and then that dense body. Intermittent, resigned-looking little bubbles wobble upward through the goo, hoping they break the surface someday. Great big piney nose, and its a combination of the best sorts of pine scents--the needles freshly fallen before theyve had a chance to soak up any ground moisture, combined with the smell of freshly cut soft pine lumber in the shop. The layers and balance within that one little corner of the hop spectrum really have a lot to say for themselves, natural and satisfying. Thick, creamy body, with understated carb. You always figure carbonation is just gonna come bursting out of a beer, you carry mental images all your life of turbocharged nucleation streams guttering up out of industrial pale lagers. This beer takes those bubbles and feeds them roofies--big hop-flavored roofies. Taking a drink is like opening the gates of a jail full of old men. You expect the bubbles to sprint to freedom, but instead, they can only shuffle. Everything about the way this beer looks (murky body, heavy lace) and moves (slow and turgid) would seem to suggest a gargantuan malt bill, but the hops really override it. Theres caramel, sure, and some toffee, maybe a little bit of nut and biscuit. A very familiar american ale mash bill. But pine really carries the day on the mid-palate, just loads of piney hop all over the place. The malt is more like an accent than a complement to the hop, even with as much malt as there obviously is in here.  The finish is a clean bright pine, very little bitterness. Seems like most of the hops went in later on this one. For all the bum news I have heard about EH suffering from bottle shock and losing its power, this was still a great beer. No doubt theres a lot of headroom for it to really show off some horsepower thats hidden by the bottling, shipping, and hanging around--even with a pretty dang fresh bottle, as this is. But whats here is still a treat.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1177,"2010-01-30",4.0,"Bottle courtesy Diomede. Pours a clear dark gold color with a tan froth of suds. Aroma is dank hops, tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, perfume, pine. The oak is also perceivable, but well integrated under the hops. Flavor is fruity hops and a slightly sharp caramel maltiness, doesnt quite live up to the aroma for me. A little sweet compared to their other IPAs. Bitterness isnt very high either, unfortunately. It could use more to cut through the malt and dry out the finish. Good, great even, but not up to Alpine IPA standards.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

The aroma was a hop assault, sharp floral scents, resinous pine, grapefruit zest... Wheres the malt?  It did appear briefly in the flavor.  I got an upfront pale malt sweetness, but it was soon quashed by the hop flavors and a serious bitterness that lingered long into the finish.  Very good, indeed.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"

1177,"2010-01-22",3.5,"My first taste of this beer after years of anticipation exceeded expectations ten fold, a straight blast of piney citrus hoppiness.  Then all of the sudden one swig later and for the next 20oz(approx) it was the malt bomb of all malt bombs.  Dont get me wrong, malt is good and all, but this thing was a caramel wasteland.  Then upon having my second bottle a few nights later, I didnt even get that first swig of all those fun and tasty hop attributes, just heavier hand of malt.  I think I over rated my experience based on that ultimate tease first taste, because I really didnt like it much thereafter.  Could the bottles have been old? Only marginally since I dont think it came out all that long ago in 22oz bottles.  I would love to and will strive to even, have this on tap, brand spanking fresh and rerate.

Amber colored and pours with a pretty nice head for the abv that settles to a thin patchy layer.  The flavor is very citrusy with oranges and lemons coming through strong.  I pick up a little mango as well.  Slick malt underneath all the hops.  A sweet bitter sting shows to let you know this is a hefty beer but despite that this remains remarkably drinkable for what it is.

So much grapefruit and citrus and a super strong floral bitterness. Smooth body and carbonation. The caramel malts become sweet as my tongue adjusts to the avalanche of hops.

The taste is a big blast of biter grapefruit with caramel, nuts and something soapy. There is also a bit of acid from the oak aging (which works here).

Let me say this first, I would have preferred not to have this on cask, I think it is a beer that has more of its complexity brought out with a touch more carbonation and a slightly colder serving temperature.  That doesnt make sense, but in my opinion it seemed to muddled as featured at Blue Palms.  Nonetheless, I was ecstatic to finally be able to try this one.  Appears orange-gold, cloudy, and without much head.  Aroma has grapefruity and citrusy hops, but also another dimension of vanilla and oak sweetness.  A balanced aroma for sure.  Flavor builds rather than jumps out at you, not exactly what I was expecting.  There are hops, but also an underlying maturity to this drink, sort of a oakier version of Southern Tiers OA Unearthly.  Some dried fruit, vanilla, and citrus.  Finish is bitter but balanced.

1177,"2009-05-13",4.4,"Hand bottle generously given to me by my friend mreusch. It pours a pretty, nearly-clear amber with a fluffy white head that diminishes leaving behind cascading lace. This beer features an amazing hop nose without smacking you in the face: citric, floral, perfumy and lightly resinous hop notes are supported by candy sugar and sweet light caramel malt notes. Very nice. Medium-bodied with soft carbonation and a solid tongue-squeezing bitterness that lingers on the back sides of the tongue long after you swallow. There is also a touch of alcohol warmth at the finish. Amazingly subtle and well-integrated up-front: notes of citric and floral hops dance in-step with sweet caramel malt. Pleasantly bitter with a touch of alcohol thrown into the mix, this is an IIPA that doesnt try to hide what it is or feel the need bully its way past your taste buds to get your attention. One of the most refined examples of the style that Ive sampled, this is the Cary Grant of IIPAs. Thanks a million for the bottle of this amazing beer, Matt.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

Nice  grainy maltiness is there as well, but certainly behind that crazy fresh hop blast. Taste is the resin hoppiness, the citrus, though still decently balanced with a strong bready maltiness.

The flavor follows with the bitter orange and grapefruit hops to go with a big dose of pine resin. The hops are balanced nicely by the big, sweet caramel malt yet still plenty of bitterness on the backend. Medium-full bodied and very smooth and almost chewy on the mouthfeel.

1177,"2009-04-22",4.1,"Growler.  Pours a hazy, glowing, golden-orange color.  A thick, frothy, off-white head is lasting, and leaves dense, sticky patches of cloud like lacing behind.  Right up front, the nose shows a powerful blast of citrus blossom hops, followed by sticky pine resin and hints of cannabis.  The underlying malt base is bold in its own right, buttered toffee and hints of toast coming to mind.  Flavors continue the trend, strikingly bitter with grapefruit, orange, and pine hops, yet sufficiently balanced with ample, sweet toffee malts.  Big, thick, and smooth, the palate skirts the edge of being syrupy, but ultimately settles on the substantial, non-cloying side of things.

Pours a deep clear amber with a short-lived off-white head that leaves bits of lacing on the way down.

The aroma is massive with a big, deep resinous pine hop smell that is almost more sweet than bitter combined with the tropical fruit presence of oranges and grapefruits.

The taste is spectacular with the massive pine hop bitterness up front that just hangs onto the palate as the bready malt backbone and citrus hops all pile on.  I also seem to get an interesting spiciness that tingles the palate between sips...tough to identify.  This is a seriously complex beer. 

The mouthfeel is certainly on the fuller side of things with enough soft carbonation to carry all of the flavors that assault the palate.  The flavors just stick to the tongue and build up after each sip.

This is one of the biggest DIPAs Ive ever tasted.  Im not sure Ive ever gotten so many different flavors in a beer of this style and Im seriously impressed by this one.  Pure Hoppiness is good, but this just blew me away.  World class.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Aroma is very piney and powerfully loaded with resinous hops- almost a nice dank weed hop component as well which is nice.  Flavor is tacky with tons of resinous hops, citrus, some grapefruit and lots of pine sap with some nice tropical fruitiness to liven it up a bit.

1177,"2008-05-29",4.2,"A top of the line DIPA and a welcomed sight at our last tasting. Brought to us in a growler that was just poured a day or two earlier. Its a pleasure to enjoy a beer like this because it reminds you how good a DIPA can be. So many are passed off as this style and they just simply arent, no matter how good intentions there were to create one. Not only did Alpine succeed, they succeeded on a high level. 

The beer poured out of the growler a beautiful orange color, a creamy one-finger thick head with a complex hop attack of tropical fruits, pine resin, citrus peel and marijuana. Full bodied, creamy mouthfeel..no harshness at all. Flavors just explode with hoppy goodness. Its really not for the faint of heart. Juicy tropical fruits combined with the piney power of the hop and the resiny goodness that comes from it just really does cartwheels on the tongue. Theres a good bit of sweetness to counter the bitterness in this beer, but make no mistake...the hops are the star of this show and they should be. Highly recommended and a pleasure to drink.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

1177,"2008-04-25",4.1,"Growler from Padrefan98, big thanks for this unexpected gift Jon. Pours a clear deep orangey copper with a large fluffy white head. Aroma is pure heaven. Tons of fresh hops balanced with the perfect touch of malt sweetness. I swear I could sit here and smell this all day long. Medium bodied that is slightly dry and finishes bitter but not overly bitter for the giant hop aroma. Flavor is full of fresh citrus hops, grapefruit rind, cereal, grain, and caramel and help balance this one out. I wish a little more of the sweetness from the aroma followed inot the flavor but still one fantastic beer.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
1177,"2008-04-25",4.2,"Pours dark copper with a slight haze. A fullish rush of fine carbonation swells up a inch-plus head of off-white.
Ripped sheets of clingy foam, and a full coverage skim coat remains throughout.

Pungently hoppy with oak-laden malt undertones.
Grapefruit pith, candied bitter orange peel, pine resin, freshly turned earth, and oak bark. Alcohol is everpresent with each whiff. 

Sticky, sappy, chewy mouthfeel. Tongue- coating, and on the thick side of medium.

Bitter spruce sap, citrus oils, leafy hops, and juicy malt lead off the pallet. An oaky dryness steps forward along with warming alcohol. Lingering bitterness, ripe fruit, and forest floor are a mainstay for each sip.
A whallop of grapefruit, pine needles, and oaky malt.

Quite malty for an IIPA, and approaching barleywine territory, but stopping short.
A bit numbing in the nose and pallet, with the onslaught of hops and alcohol.

Similar to Hopsickle, but more malty, and the oaking adds some nice depth, which rounds out the brew as well.

1177,"2008-04-22",4.2,"On tap at Obriens. Golden murky amber with a thin white head. Enticing lemon, banana, citrus aromas. Smooth and slightly syrupy on your palate. Great bitter hops and perfect light malt. Sweetness hides any alcohol . Pine like finish! Dangerous indeed. Awesome. Beer!!","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
1177,"2008-04-21",3.4,"A well carbonated pour from the growler easily produces a three-finger thick, creamy textured, light tan colored crown of froth.  The beer is a lightly orange tinged, full amber color that shows a lightly hop-hazed, orange-copper hue when held up to the light.  The aroma is very sticky with hop notes; candied grapefruit, huge lychee, apricot & other tropical fruit notes are quite noticeable even while pouring this brew.  A focused sampling of the aroma gets aromatic notes that lean much more towards the herbal / pine  side of the spectrum.  Though the beer still smells of sticky, sugar preserved hop buds.  The sharper side of the hop produces notes of grass, pine sap, some slight chive notes, a huge hemp oil contribution.  It is interesting that this was so intensely fruity smelling as I was pouring it, but that a focused inspection of the aroma is much more dominated by concentrated herbal & essential oil components.

Sweet and thick tasting with a ton of residual malt sugars, these are not by any means overwhelming though as this has a huge hop character that easily offsets the malt; in fact the residual malt sugars are not even overly noticeable because of all the hop character.  Sharply bitter, with lots of green, astringent hop notes and a finish that tastes like what I would imagine chewing on a fat, juicy, marijuana bud (though there is lots of malt to keep this from becoming over-bearing).  Up front and through to the middle some nice, underlying citrus & tropical fruit flavors are found; these contribute flavors of lychee, candied ruby-red-grapefruit, orange-marmalade and peach concentrate.  This is clearly dominated by the greener hop flavors; in addition to the piquantly expressive hemp-oil flavor there are notes of chives, mentholated pine, lots of herbal turpenes (rosemary, garlic chive and a touch of sage oil).  Thick and chewy, this is approaching a Barleywine in heft, it just retains enough lightness to retain the IPA allusions though.  The plethora of hop character also keeps this from every getting sticky or cloying.  The malt character is clearly a supporting character, really not noticeable on its own, but it plays a significant role in carrying the hop character.

My second pour of this beer reminds me how very well carbonated this beer is; visually it is quite apparent, but the beer is thick enough that it is not as noticeable in the flavor as one might think, though it does add a certain prickle / lightness to the beer as it flows across the tongue.  This beer doesnt seem to take to warming as much as some, the combination of hops and alcohol gets a bit harsh after a bit.

Big, powerful, overbearing, an exercise in self inflicted tongue flagellation, but is it good.  It most certainly is, but it is a bit too astringent & hemp-oil dominated for me.  There are times when I can enjoy a scathing, tongue scraping, astringently hoppy beer, but most times I like something a bit more drinkable.  Definitely a beer for the enthusiastic hop head.  I am not sure if I am getting more discriminating or if I am just getting burned out on over-the-top beers, but this is not nearly as enjoyable as I expected.  I really do enjoy excessive amounts of hops in a beer, but it has to have a drinkability and finesse that this beer just doesnt quite have.  Still this is a good beer, though it is one I really only want a 12 oz serving of  (luckily I could share my growler, because there was no way I would finish it on my own).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The flavor has a good amount of sweet but clean malts.   The hops are plentiful, but not overly bitter.   Very flavorful with an herbal, woody quality.   The alcohol is very well hidden.   Balance is almost perfect.   Palate is medium and smooth.   The strength truly is dangerous.   Tastes like a well balanced and flavorful IPA.   I would never guess that is is as strong as it is.

Rerate: growler from the brewery on release day last friday, consumed that night with the two buddies that I drove out there with.   This is a glorious beer.   Having this fresh on release day couldnt have hurt, but this ws just stunning stuff, with the oak and tropical fruity hops working perfectly together in the aroma, and the flavor balancing sweetness and bitterness just so to hide the ridiculous 11.25% abv that this batch came out to.   You would never guess that this beer is that strong, but the flavor is a pleasurable sensory overload.

Big tropical fruit citrus pine nose with light clean caramel.  Some dry hopping grassiness/tastiness noted.  If I try, I get a little clean oak.  The new bottling seems to be much tastier and smellier than my previous samplings, so now Ill put it at a 4.3 now.  Rerate.  22oz bottle from wetherel, thanks John!  Clear orange with a 1/2 finger light beige head, fading to a thick ring and film before too long.  Aroma is full of fruit--pineapple and citrus the strongest--with plenty of piny hops as well.  Sweet caramel, cotton candy and light grass make up the rest of the aroma.  Flavor seems to be a bit subdued due to the intense bitterness of the beer.  This doesnt make sense, but its all I can figure out at this point.  I cant say that I can pick out any oak chips anywhere.  Anyways, the caramel and cotton candy sweetness are a good deal stronger in the flavor, but still cant undo what has been done with the hops. Bone dry finish.  Full body with low carbonation.  Even though they are both fruity, this takes on a completely different road compared to something like Dreadnaught.  Not bad--merely different.  I dont really like the intensity of the cotton candy though.

Aroma:  This beer reeks of hops, the aroma jumped out of the growler the moment it the cap came off.  The glass holds plethora of sugary pink grapefruit, over ripe tangerine and pine forest floor after a good rain.  The smell is overly fragrant but not really aggressive.  


Appearance:  An unassuming brash copper with a clean feel.  Almost no bubble movement inside the glass, only a few strays.  Head is full and fluffy, an attractive antique white.


Flavor:  Begins with a lot of the same qualities as lemon iced tea; almost pungent and herbal on the front of the tongue, bits of apples around the sides and lemon bitterness across the back.  An almost cheese like characteristic comes in next, surprisingly attractive for such a poor description on my part.  Citrus moves in next with the same buttery grapefruit sense that the Pure Hoppiness possesses.  It creeps around the back sides of the tongue and gently lays down a blanket of soothing bitterness.  Finishes murky, almost damp and mossy with hints of kiwi and under ripe green grapefruit.


Palate:  Medium body, somewhat hard with just a nip of carbonation sting.


Overall:  Very nice with a curious and unique flavor.   Not an overly complex or deep beer but quite enjoyable none the less.  Highly recommended to hop heads","Los Angeles, California, USA","WestsideThreat"

My two drinking buddies not only disagreed, but didnt even get a whiff or taste of vanilla in their experience (buddies were there for draught, not cask). Im guessing Simcoe, but I believe there is more at work in that hop mix. Very rich. Yes as far as the hops breakdown goes, sure, there is some of the citrusy and even grapefruit bits, not much of the piney bits though.

The wood was quite apparent in the nose, although I did not know at the time it was oak chipped...I just kinda figured it was aged in oak.

Thick with soft carbonation. Tad fuzzy. Instantly sharply alcoholic and brashly hoppy, yet equally-soft hop nuanced. Hops continue with their explosive medley of soft citrus and pine-tinged flavors. Full-blown hop bitterness lacerates the palate, but the tangerine-accented hop softness restores a sense of balance. Slight presence of salty tannins lends more sharpness to the otherwise-juicy body. Absent balance of malt is instead replaced by brilliantly-extracted hop flavors, which act as support to the brash bitterness. Ends with a breath of salty dryness, otherwise awash with a fully rich display of juicy, tongue-clinging hop oils, pinewood, and bright hop burps.

In the time it took me to write that the head has collapsed into a white veil with a couple of white fringed fish eyes on an amber body.

The nose, upon closer inspection, is fecund (theres a snotty word for you) with pine, caramel chews, juniper, and fresh hop funk.  As you can guess hops dominate the pallet in this one but with enough of that caramel maltieness from the nose to round it out and give the beer a big smooth thick mouthfeel.

I was expecting a brash hop-flavored kick in the teeth but the bitterness is like silk leaving plenty of pine forest and hop flowers on  the tongue.  It gets more of that funky quality as it warms as well as a touch of snow.  The bitterness is everywhere like a subwoofer in your mouth.

Rerate: 2004-  Since the new batch has come out, I've been drinking this non-stop.  Growlers of smooth 11% for $8.50!  It's not just cheap and smooth.  It is one of the top double IPAs out there IMO.  I had a Dreadnaught the other night.  It was excellent, but I think I like the Exponential better.  The Dreadnaught was a touch too sweet and syrupy.  The new batch of the exponential may lack a little of the mango tha I smelled and tasted in the 2003.  The 2004 tastes a little more oaky, smooth, and dry.  This is so good, I'm sitting here licking the lace off of my glass.  Unfortuately, I just finished it.  Fortunately, I'm going to get my growlers refilled this weekend.  RERERERERERATE 061504 release:  This batch has the best aroma since the first.  Aroma has a lot of orange, citrus, and spice to it.  Very piney, and has a lot of spice to it.  More spice than I've tasted in previous batches.  Mouthful is not a creamy as batch # 2 but is still very good.  This is a very good all around exponential.  Pat nailed it with this one.  Batch # 1 probably is still my favorite, but this one is very close.  Excellent balance.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"
1177,"2003-08-16",4.3,"I get a nice fire orangish color with some decent head.  It gives off a passion fruit, kumquat and peach aroma.  The taste is pretty damn cool for a double ipa cause the pine forest is not up front and in my face, instead I get pinapples and peaches and then some of the pine forest appears. As time goes on starfruit appears and i fuckin love the starfruit. For 10.5 this beer is damn smooth with a lot of cool ass character.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
1177,"2003-08-16",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2010 1st batch (2003) It pours a nice hazy yet brilliant orange color and is topped off by a nice icy shimmering head..the aroma had tons of plump oranges and grapefruits, sweet mango, and touches of pine..the flavors showed nice ripe mandarine orange, pine needles, hop resin, sweet citrus ribbon candy...The bitterness is insane yet totally checked by the fruity sweetness of the malts..This beer right here puts dreadnaught, and the rest of em, to freakin shame!  If only this was more readily available to anyone outside of san diego youd see what i was talking about..oh well..more for me.  Did i mention that it was 10.5%??  yeah.  Re-Rate 2nd batch (2004) Edition:  I dont know, I do not find this years as good as the 2003 because its less sweet, more dry, and less balanced showing more bitterness and alcohol and just isnt as desireable. re-rate 3rd batch (2004): Just like Batch 1, superb...Avg. Rating for Draft 8.5.8.5.17 (4.3)Re-Rate 2009 Bottle:  Pours crystal clear bronze and full frothy head.  nose is resiny hops draped over fruits like nectarines, peaches, and mango with a soft oaky earthiness underneath.  Flavors are heavily influenced by the oak hear with the hop flavors taking the fruity route of peachand nectarine with a full, somewhat syrupy nature...while the bitterness is relentlessly resiny with soft indications of pine,  and the alcohol is warming. I re-rate this as IPAs, not to mention  IIIIIPAs arent my thing anymore and the world need know dat, foos...but yeah. Still good.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
