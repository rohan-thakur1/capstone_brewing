3427,"2016-06-13",4.1,"Picked up a berrylicious cake at Nakitanitei near Lingua World Cafe in Osaka. 
I got it to pair with Odells Friek which is a 6.9% ale with cherries and raspberries added then aged 2 years in oak barrels.
Its an orange pink color best described as salmon with a fizzy light pink foam that vanished in an eyeblink. Sharp oaky aroma with an almond nut quality I surmise came from the cherry pits. Theres also a tart cherry and raspberry component which I enjoy.
A lovely soft round carbonation that reveals a very acidic, tart cherry, nutty almond and earthy raspberry. This is exceedingly tart, acidic but gives enough berry sweetness in the dry lingering finish.
Man with the cake the berry flavor really pops prompting me to say Wow! While the chocolate gives an amazing sweet counterpoint.
If youve got a berry sour get this cake to pair with it. Superb. On its own Id say hovering around 4 but paired with this raspberry-chocolate cake its easily a 4.2 so Ill split the difference and give it a 4.1.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

A - Pours murky red with a small one finger tall white head leaving little to no lacing down the glass. It was carbonated at least.


S - Smells of your typical kriek but with a bit less sweetness. Hints of cherries, dulled funk, light sourness, and wet oak. It was pretty funky initially but it faded as it warmed up and allowed some of the sweet fruits to come through.


T - Starts off with a nice dose of tart cherries slowly giving way to a mix of dry oak tannins, dulled fruity sweetness, and light horse blanket funk. Based on the nose I thought this one might be pretty funky but it isnt. Finish is a mix of light sweetness and dulled sourness, lingering for a short period of time. Pretty good.


M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Light tartness in the feel, lingering through the finish.

3427,"2014-05-14",4.2,"August 24th, 2012 - Heres a treat: a special indulgence to mark the last evening of my summer vacation, to conclude my stay with my family back home, and a kick-off before returning to a strict and stringent ketogenic diet. With a special kind of affected reverence, I poured the Friek into my favorite glass (which has not nor will travel with me for fear of breaking it), revealing a brew with a blushing peach color, and little to no head. Theres a moment of alarm as I consider the possibility that the beer has gone flat, but I see enough bubbles in the body to assuage myself. I dont have to crane my head too far to take in the aroma - the dominant note is an oak sourness that reminds me of some of the heavier Belgian brews my old roommate and I used to sip with relish back in Colorado. Lighter touches of rose, vanilla, sour cherry, and some dark chocolate shavings decorate the central pillar of sourness and pungent wood like a pagan decoration. On the taste I catch more ripe raspberry than I did on the nose, and a lighter, brighter cherry flavor swells and takes on more prominence. Overall, the flavor of the Friek begins very quiet and placid, ramping up as the sourness and oak burn kick in, and then bringing in a cornucopia of little sweet fruit flavors. After that, its a quick drop from the cacophony of tastes, leaving a low, exhausted oak note and a lumbering, deep, mashed raspberry and cherry taste to contrast with the earlier, brighter fruit notes. In the case that you couldnt tell from the above, this is a powerful beer drinking experience. Each sip brings the drinker on a roller coaster loop of flavors and tastes, replicating the peak and drops. This is a fruit beer worth splurging on, and a worthy way to end a relaxing vacation home with the family.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The beer is hazy and ruby/orange colored with minimal head. Cherries, oak, and wild yeast make up the aroma. Acetic feel with lots of tart cherry flavor. Well done. Delicious with lots of fruit. Slight pucker in the cheeks. Acetic finish. A solid fruit sour ale.

Aroma is dry oak, funk, underlying cherries, and a bit of lemon with a very dry and clean finish.  Taste is dominated by dry cherry followed by minimal funk, tartness, and a sour, cherry burn down into the finish.  Clean and dry.  Definitely closer to an american wild/sour than a proper lambic but there are some fruit lambic aspects to the aroma and taste.

3427,"2012-11-10",3.7,"Picked this up recently for $16 despite passing on it earlier in the year. Its dark purple-red-burgundy and had a head for a moment then it disappeared. It is carbonated fine though so maybe my glass was dirty. Smells very woody like barrels and a hint of cherries and Brett. Taste is cherries, tart raspberry, very strong wood barrel flavor, not bad at all. This really doesnt taste like lambic to me but as an American Wild Ale it works. Only problem is the price tag, the quality if this beer does not justify $16 and I would never buy it again.

Flavors largely follow suit, towing the line between sweet and tart, never taking a clear stance on either side of the equation.  Cherry and raspberry flavors seem authentic, but also a bit excessively sugared.  Yeast again comes of quite lactic, but there is no lambic-like buggy funk to be found.  The palate is a letdown, coming across rather flat and lifeless.  Its surprisingly watery as well, definitely lacking in body.  Meh.

3427,"2011-11-26",3.6,"Bought bottle at kokoman, a store that does not store its beer as well as possible but anyway it pours a nice color but is murky and has no head. Red-brown like a Flemish brown. In fact the aroma follows with rodenbach character and mellow, deep cherry-impacted wood. Comes across as thin and lacking depth, but I attribute that also to the poor storage conditions. But there is really nothing not to like. We have subdued, disciplined acidity, characterful wood tannins, and natural fruit sweetness for balance. Very drinkable and would like to have again.

3427,"2011-07-26",3.3,"A vigorous pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a scant, one-finger thick, pale pink tinged, off-white colored head that disappears fairly quickly.  The beer is a dark cherry color that shows a bright, lightly hazed, pale red / amber hue when held up to the light.   The aroma has a spicy tartness to it that speaks to either cherry acid character or acetic acid or both, it is not overly aggressive.  There is a chewy, cherry skin complexity and fruitiness here in the aroma as well as maybe a touch of tart raspberry character; the tart raspberry notes become a bit more noticeable as the beer warms up.  Other sharper notes of oak contribute a touch of spiciness and just a general soft woodiness.  There is a touch of medicinal / phenolic aromatic character.

Sharply tart, though not exceedingly so (I am not puckering up), there is a just a hint of sweetness here and both of these accentuate a tart cherry flavor and a chewy raspberry pulp fruitiness.  There is just a hint of carbonation to this beer that adds just enough texture so that it is not flat.  There is an acidity to this beer that combines with the carbonic acid to give this beer a fair amount of bite.  The finish has a slight woodiness to it that is a touch astringent and just a hint spicy, as well as just a bit like a woody plank.  This is actually quite light bodied; it is definitely very drinkable.  The tartness here, while not very aggressive, provides a nice balancing note to the fruit; much of it comes from the fruit itself, but there also seems to be a fair amount of lactic acidity to this beer.  As the beer significantly warms a sense of the malt starts to become apparent; there is some biscuit like malt character and a touch of toasted whole grain flavors that are noticed, especially in the long finish of this beer.

This is not the most complex beer in the world; calling this a Lambic could certainly lead one to be a bit disappointed, though I certainly wasnt expecting this to be anything like a Lambic, so I am not nearly so disappointed as I would be.  I definitely feel like I should be able to say more about this beer than I am able; it is certainly a bit more simplistic than it should be.  The beer actually has a bit more carbonation than the feeble head would suggest.  In some ways this can taste a bit like watered down cherry / raspberry juice, though it is not quite all that bad.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Funky, musty aroma with lots of earthy oak and barnyard character. Hints of old wood, wet hay and damp basement along with slight vinegary acetic acid and a boat load of fresh fruit. The cherries are pretty strong with a slight syrupy medicinal character but the raspberries are very prominent. Im even picking up the pits/seeds.

Medium bodied but on the lower end of the spectrum with a very tart, mouth-puckering character. Sour without being acidic. Very dry with lots of funky bugs and toasted oak barrel character. This beer is bursting with fresh fruit. There s plenty of tart dark cherry but just like the aroma the tart, funky raspberries are more dominant.

Acquired in a recent trade I shared this at a large tasting as more than four ounces would not have agreed with me at the time. It seemed to be a hit which is no surprise - a quality American sour the balance is just perfect for a spring evening by the bonfire.

Aroma and appearance - The opaque maroon body is dim even under direct light. Looking like a thick Cherry 7UP it sparkles with a wisp of clear lacing. The cherry and raspberries are tart, crisp, and sharp without being too powerful. Rather than curling the nose hair this one simply puts it on end.

Flavor and palate - Dry and sour this tastes like someone decided to make a Sour Patch Kid based cherry soft drink. The balance is nearly perfect. Each sip builds on the last so that by the end the finish burns the throat. More than a half pint would be hard on my stomach so have the Tums handy if you plan on drinking this entire thing alone.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3427,"2011-05-21",2.8,"Poured into a tulip. Big thanks to KeefD for this.

3.0 A: Heavily hazed deep amber, not quite ripe plum color. Aggressive pour yielded just a touch of head, but it fell really quickly and left no lacing.

3.5 S: The cherry sticks out slightly more than the raspberry, but neither are very intense. A decent tartness, but just a touch of acidic sourness. Somewhat grassy with a mountain stream freshness.

3.5 T: Cherry and raspberry mesh together well, but there could be some more power behind them. Only mildly acidic with a touch of acetic acid and not much more in terms of lactic acid. Any mouthpuckering comes from a cranberry-like tartness and not the sourness. The oak is surprisingly mild and there is nearly no tannic astringency. A moderate sweetness to balance out the tartness.

3.5 M: Medium body. A bit undercarbonated and the carbonation that is there needs to be spritzier. It lies a bit heavy on the tongue. Otherwise, okay.

3.0 D: Im not really that impressed with this one, especially given the high price tag. I would have preferred a much bigger fruit component, with a ""buggier"" base beer.

As your palate adjusts you can start to pick out the fruit notes, which really work well.  Oak finishes.  This beer could use a little bit more complexity in the finish, as it goes straight from sour fruit to the light oak finish.  Sourness is abrupt at the beginning but fades as you continue to drink it.  Mouthfeel is very full bodied and the carbonation is relatively light.

Taste was a pretty big exclamation of the aroma. Sourness and Brett yeast somewhat overwhelm the palate, with a somewhat Pickering mouthfeel, not unlike lackluster wine. But the taste was superb. Sour cherry, sour cranberry (I know its not what they were using or going for, but that was he resulting taste nonetheless), a lingering taste not unlike a musty cellar full of oak wine barrels. Even though the palate was a little rough, I found it oddly drinkable and thirst quenching. Hard to describe. In all, an OK beer.

3427,"2011-02-28",3.8,"Typical sour pour with a hazy, pinkish, mahogany color and a fizzy, pinkish head which dissipates to nothing with no lace.  The nose is like a sweet tart with subtle sweetness from the raspberries, a sour cherry tartness, wild yeast tartness, bretty funk, barnyard, light horse blanket, and a subtle wet wood note.  The flavor is seemingly more young lambic-like with plenty of tart and sour notes to go around; the sweet raspberry notes are incredibly faint and almost completely masked by the tartness and acidity but still notable nevertheless.  Other notes of mushroom funk, light horse blanket, sour cherries, tart bretty notes, underlying cranberry, a high acidity (though not puckering), and a very faint wet wood.  The palate is very lively, somewhere between puckering and quenching with the acidity, and light to medium in body.  The finish is still high in acidity bringing the quenching nature of the beer to near puckering levels, average in length, sour cherries and cranberries, and the wet wood notes becoming almost musky; I get a very subtle vanilla notes after the sourness leaves the tongue.  As far lambics go, this seems to be very young, despite what the bottle description says.  I feel like the die hard sour beer lovers will fall in love with this one, I was hoping for a bit more complexity and a sourness that did not completely dominate the flavor.  That said, the use of the fruit was nice adding sweetness and tartness.  I think with more time in the Woodcut barrels, this may have been an excellent fruit lambic, but right now it is just a wheat based sour fruit beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

3427,"2010-10-28",3.7,"(Draught)  Pours a cloudy red body with a small off-white head.  Aroma of cherry, grass, vinegar, yogurt, and raspberries.  Flavor cherry, yogurt, raspberries, and tart citrus.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"

3427,"2010-09-19",3.8,"Sampled at GABF!  Raspberry pour produced a very small white ring.  Tart cherry skin, oak, balsamic vinegar, and funk.  Doesnt quite have the pronounced woodiness of ""Woodcut"" but it is there.  Pretty tasty.  Really like their more forward offerings!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
3427,"2010-09-19",4.4,"Sampled at GABF on 9/17/2010. This sour ale pours a hazy reddish color from the tap. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is cranberry, cherry, fruity and tart with some wood. A medium bodied sour. The malts are fruity and sweet, tart and funk. Lots of cherry, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is tart.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3427,"2010-03-09",3.6,"Avery Sour Ale Fest. Very cool beer.  Sour and tart cherry flavor with some earthy funk thrown in.  Really enjoyed this one.  Cool brew.","Colorado, USA","That1Guy"
3427,"2010-03-03",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2011 sampled at FOBAB 2009... poured a strawberry red with a thin wispy just off-white head... soft berry aroma with vanilla and wood accents... medium tart berry flavors with added vanilla notes.  medium mouthfeel with soft yet lively carbonation.  is this there first attempt at a sour?  not bad at all.
750ml bottle. thanks to peter for the trade.  rerated on 7/30/2011... pours a deeper red currant shade of hue, effervescent with bubbles permeating throughout, and a hint of a thin bubbly wisps not totally constituting a head.  score for the appearance will stand at a 3 as its not all that visually enticing and also lacks much of a withstanding and lasting head... aroma of semi-sour cherries with oak tannins, perhaps a dash of cinnamon.... flavors seem to be equal cherry and raspberries, perky with semi-lively carbonation, but somewhat short in duration.  finish is a little abrupt lending a bit of earth and a soft very light bitterness.  thin a bit watery in the mouth and therefore subtracting a point in the palate department.  aside from that, my score stands.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3427,"2010-03-01",3.6,"cloudy medium-dark red body, off-white/pink head.  sharp lacto/pedio nose of soap-soaked cherries and raspberries.  moderately sharp and acetic, some lacto/cream/yogurt/fattiness, finishing with more musty raspberries (light seedy note).  better than expected.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3427,"2010-02-28",3.6,"Draught at Sour Fest. Redish amber with very small white head. Aroma of woody funk with some caramels and unidentifiable fruit. Taste is sour funk with prevalent woodiness. Palate has medium carbonation and body.","Denver, Colorado, USA","potbeerjob"
3427,"2010-01-10",3.5,"Draught at Big Beers, Belgians and Barleywines Festival.  Pours clear light ruby with a medium-low white head, some retention with fair lacing.  Aroma is medium malt (straw, grain) with sour cherries, earthy hops, and funky yeast.  Medium sour and sweet cherries balanced, medium malt flavor with no hops.  Medium-light body, medium carbonation, and a dry finish.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
3427,"2009-11-29",3.8,"FoBAB 2009.  This poured a pinkish amber body with a tiny white head.  It had an aroma of lightly tart cherries, a damp wood pile, a drizzle of white vinegar, and bit of funk.  In the flavor, the above lay atop some old bread dough with some sourness kicking in.  Pretty decent brew.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3427,"2009-11-14",3.8,"Sampled at FoBAB 09.  Murky red pour.  Some head.  Aroma is tart fruit, sour, some earthy funk notes.  Flavor is sour cherry, a bit of earthiness and sugar.  Pretty good lambic.  . .","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
3427,"2009-11-09",4.0,"FOBAB 09. Pours a murky reddish amber color with a quickly dissipating white head. Taste is of raspberry, assorted other fruit, wood, and grass. Taste starts off with different kinds of fruit, specifically raspberry and cherry. Has a nice underlying wooden flavor underneath all the fruit. Tartness starts to set in after a few sips. Has a nice lingering earthy funk flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp, but too light. Drinks real easy.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
3427,"2009-11-09",4.0,"Sampled at FoBAB 2009. Pours a hazy raspberry amber, murky, whitish small head that dies to a film, laces, a bit reddish. Aromas are berries, sweet and tart, a bit of wet wood, sourness, touch of vinegar, vanilla. Initial is lightly tart, berry, vanilla, sour, faint vinegar, wet wood, full, but light. Odd. A pretty good sessionable sour. Sticks to the palate, nice. A great flanders red interpretation with a few teeth.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3427,"2009-11-08",4.2,"FOBAB- 2009-  pours a pinkish red with a small white head.  notes of cherry pie, tart cherries, jam, bread, and earth.  damn good.  tight beer.  smells like awesome fresh cherry pie and flavor has really nice cherry tartness to it.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
