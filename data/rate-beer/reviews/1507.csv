1507,"2016-12-31",3.8,"12 ounce bottle from Woodmans in Janesville, WI, served at cellar temperature in an Ayinger weizen glass. Big smooth dark tan head fills much of the glass and wont go away; when it finally recedes a totally opaque blackness can be seen...coffee unquestionably dominates the nose, dark-roasty coffee, but some weizenbock character does emerge with time, a bit of caramelized banana, clove and sourdough showing up, though always struggling for a place with the java....on the tongue, sweet and caramel-like at first, but with a somewhat rough tartness and a bit of alcohol coming in quickly, and coffee bitterness dominating the long finish...very smooth on the tongue, full and velvety-creamy, with just enough carbonation to sparkle a touch. Interesting concoction that works for the most part - far and away the best thing Ive had from this brewery so far.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1507,"2016-12-02",3.6,"Having this beer when its a little old and the coffee characteristics suffer from it. Aroma is good but no coffee. Flavor has the coffee showing up but not so much like fresh coffee.. Body is good though personally I would have preferred it a bit softer from the crisp carbonation.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
1507,"2016-06-26",3.8,"Bottle thanks to Bytemesis poured dark cola brown with a beige head and nice lacing. Aromas of caramel malt, lactose, chocolate, and vanilla. Flavor is mild bitter sweet.","Wisconsin, USA","BrewHaMeister"
1507,"2016-06-26",3.7,"Bottle. Pours deep black, small beige head, good lacing. Aroma of coffee, roasty malt, anise. Flavor is light sweet, CV light bitter, mega coffee, roasty. Lingering bitterness, bit of ashtray. Medium body.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
1507,"2016-06-22",4.1,"Taste: Deep dark semi sweet malts, dark bread, complex, dry coffee finish, hint of chocolate malts and dark fruits as well. Big roasted coffee nose.

1507,"2015-12-25",3.3,"12 oz bottle poured into Moeder Lambic glass on Christmas Day after a big prime rib dinner. Im going into this with an open mind despite the fact coffee is not a big selling point for me in a beer. Dark black colored ale with minor (and mildly disappointing) tannish head. Nose is more subdued than anticipated but the coffee, roasted malt, and chocolate characteristics are present. Everything about this one proclaims coffee. Roasted malts, nutty qualities, full on mouthfeel, subtle undercurrent of dark chocolate. Slightly thinner than other coffee efforts which falls in line with the fact its a wheat coffee ale and not a coffee stout. If you love coffee, you should meet this ""Joe"". For me, its not really in my wheelhouse. I can appreciate but Ill likely have to find a taker for the remaining bottle I have left.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"
1507,"2015-12-23",4.2,"Pours black with a medium khaki head with excellent retention.

1507,"2015-11-21",4.0,"12oz bottle from Casanova in Hudson on a Sunday with commonmac. Coffee and chocolate nose. Nice creamy body. Maybe some subtle vanilla. Chocolate coffee taste with nice finish. Solid. Nice to meet you joe.","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
1507,"2015-10-29",3.8,"Bottle. Black pour with a brown head. Aroma starts very bitter and roasty, some coffee and dark chocolate notes, more sweetness as it warms with some maraschino cherry. Flavour is surprisingly rich, some sweet wheat malt coming through with coffee notes and chocolate, hints of citrus and a little spicy when cold giving way to sweet fruit as it warms. Really interesting brew, and pretty tasty.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
1507,"2015-10-03",3.6,"I like Alterra and I like Three Sheeps. The combination works really well as one may expect. Maybe I will try heating some up in a mug tomorrow morning.","","Cousin_Larry"
1507,"2015-08-24",3.2,"Coffee hits the front, not the back of the tongue, which makes me think of coffee grounds rather than good coffee. Frothy palate, yucky finish. The man serving it suggested that this batch is nearing the end; could be better when fresher. (At Summer Beer Dabbler, St. Paul, MN)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1507,"2015-08-13",4.1,"On tap at Old Fashioned pours a deep black with a thin layer of beige head. Nose has burnt malt/wheat chaff, molasses, licorice, toast, coffee bean, burnt caramel. Flavor has more of the same, tons of chocolate covered coffee bean, toast, brown sugar, licorice, some dried fruit, a bit nutty too. Full bodied but dry. Very well made.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1507,"2015-05-31",4.2,"If I could get away with drinking this as my morning coffee at work, the day would be much brighter. Or much sleepier, considering 3 Sheeps has pushed the 2015 vintage of Joe to 8.0% ABV. The coffee aroma wraps itself around a little chocolate scent and leave you with a smooth, sweet ale. Enjoyed from a bottle.",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"
1507,"2015-05-04",4.5,"If you like iced coffee...this is the closest thing in beer form. The lighter/smoother base of the wheat, compared to a stout or porter, really lets the Colectivo roast shine through.","Wisconsin, USA","jro"
1507,"2015-04-25",3.6,"On tap at Happy Gnome. Pours near black with a a light yellowish brown head that dissipates slowly to the edges.

1507,"2014-09-28",3.8,"Bottled. Poured black with a well-retained, sticky beige head.. looked great! The aroma picked up lots of coffee (sweet and tangy notes) joined by spicy, kind of dank wheat.. you need like coffee to enjoy that smell. The flavor found a wash of cold coffee from the front through the back of the palate.. some meaty wheat and more coffee at the core.. finished with burnt coffee and chocolate joined by a hit of tangy wheat. Medium-bodied, dry, and tangy on the palate.. moderate, rolling carbonation moved it well through the mouth.. tasty stuff.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1507,"2014-09-11",3.8,"Malts, coffee, cocoa. Pours nearly black with a slight medium brown foam. Nice flavor of malt, coffee, cocoa. This so not a spiced/herb beer in my tasting. In fact beeradvocate categorizes this beer as a American Dark Wheat Ale which I believe is accurate. Nice palate finish and a really nice beer.","Illinois, USA","bierenjoyer1"

1507,"2012-08-24",4.2,"On cask at GTMW - Wow...first rate for this one? Pours back with a thin off white head. Nose is mocha, real pungent lightly sweet with no bitter roastiness. Wow--this is in your face coffee and chocolate, and its beautiful. Taste has smooth coffee--no bitterness--with chocolate, light roast, and coffee grounds on the finish. Smooth and thin bodied, but thats fine--I could smell this stuff all day.
