4334,"2017-01-14",4.0,"Bottle. Archer Road Beer Stop, Sheffield. Dark bronze. Soft haze. Thin, dense film of beige head, that sticks all the way. Nose has lots of rye spice. Notes of bourbon and chocolatey, vanilla infused oak. Bit of a jaffa cake thing going on. Taste is soft, orangey sweet. Gets spicy, peppery bitter. Bit of a citric twang. Soft and smooth, massaging mouthfeel. The finish is spicy and soft bitter. Missus is comparing this with Shameless Santa. Im inclined to agree. Lovely.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"

Aroma is also well balanced with spice, vanilla, and toffee. Only problem I had was bottle was not capped properly.","LAS VEGAS, Nevada, USA","kathouse"
