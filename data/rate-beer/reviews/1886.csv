Hurray for 2 buck pints! Anyway. This is a great brew, pretty much my platonic ideal of a pale ale; a style Im generally not too into.

Beer #3 in the endless series of limited edition artist and artisan beers. Gigantic and Three Floyds unleash this true weapon of mass distraction. Citrus and tropical hoppyness lead to fill malt flavour from proper English malt, kilned over Welsh coal. Brewed for those of us that live and die in the Timbers Army and Section 8.

Nice to see Gigantic using their fifth anniversary as a justification to re-release some of their seasonals that I never got a chance to try! This, they claim, is an English Pale Ale - to which, I respond, Yeah, right! Not in a negative way, yunnerstand - this is excellent, with a bright, distinctly NON-Noble hop character youd never find in a true EPA. It settles down a bit, and sorta kinda pretends to be an EPA, with a pleasant toasted/biscuity malt character, but then the massive bitter finish comes through. This is definitely a beer for whom a Lemmy quote on the label is appropriate. Now, just double up the hops in the boil, do a bunch of dry-hopping with Mosaic, and boost the malt bill by about 40%, will you? (15/20)

Pours fuzzy apricot with a sheet of fine whites and soapy hedges. Smells of peat, malt, coal, grapfruit, orange zest, grass and some floral coatings. Nice nose. Tastes of fine malts with a smoked accent, some peaty character, a bit of hay, lots of biscuit, some bitterness and a hint of orange pith.
