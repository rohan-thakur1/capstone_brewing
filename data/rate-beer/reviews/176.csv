176,"2017-06-07",3.7,"12floz bottle (BBD: 08.16.2017, $1.50) poured into a mug glass. It appears a very dark brown with a glistening light brown head. Bakers chocolate and molasses aromas are not strong, but noted. This beer is robust, yet not overbearing. Flavors consist of roasted and crystal/caramel malts that convey moderate amounts of dark chocolate and praline. Ill use the overused term solid to summarize the quality of this porter.","","balloonbuffoon"

Aroma: quite intense aromas of coffee, dark roasted and toasted malts, dark chocolate. Hints of alcohol but only after pouring. Very light hint of vanilla.

176,"2016-07-07",4.2,"Alkohol:  6,6% obj. 
 Kolor:  Ciemny brąz przechodzący w czarny. Nieprzejrzysty trunek. 
 Piana:  Wysoka, bujna, zbita jak białko.
Beżowa czapa równo ułożonych drobnych oczek. Bardzo długo pozostaje na górze. Opada powoli do grubej warstewki. Na ściankach mnóstwo malunków.
Silna strona piwa. 
 Zapach:  Ciemne owoce. Na pierwszy plan czarna porzeczka, śliwki, daktyle, rodzynki. Delikatna paloność, ciemne słody. Po pewnym czasie aromat zaczyna budować się od nowa i przybierać na złożoności. Pojawia się karmel i chlebowa nuta ciemnego pieczywa. Dopiero po ogrzaniu kawa i gorzka czekolada. Zdecydowana woń cukru trzcinowego.
Przyjemnie. 
 Smak:  Już po pierwszych łykach kremowe, gładziutkie i śliskie na języku. W smaku już potężna kawowość i płynna gorzka czekolada. W tle orzechy włoskie. Następnie karmel, trochę toffi i ciemne pieczywo.
Palony charakter miesza się z pieczonymi nutkami ciemnego słodu.
Smak zrównoważony, bogaty. Raz po raz balans przesuwa się ze strony wytrawnej na średnio-słodką.
Chmielowoś toczy ciągłą walkę z ciemnymi słodami. Średnie ciało, alkohol całkowicie ułożony. Goryczka średnia z kawowo-prażonym finiszem. Posmak palonego ziarna ciągle pozostaje w ustach. 
Bardzo dobry, jak nie doskonały wyznacznik stylu. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Zawsze chciałem spróbować tego piwa.
Browar specjalizuje się w świetnych porterach. Porter Bałtycki z Smuttynose należy do Top 3 najlepszych Baltic Porters na świecie.

To piwo natomiast jest z pewnością wyznacznikiem stylu Robust Porter.
Złożony smak i aromat tworzą ciemne słody, skórka chlebowa, toffi, karmel i oczywiście kawa z czekoladą.
Dość mocny, konkretny, bogaty trunek.
Silne nachmielenie i akcenty pieczone równoważy mocny (jak na styl) ale niewyczuwalny alkohol.
Fajna tekstura i kremowa, śliska gładkość na języku sprawiają, że pije się to piwo niezwykle przyjemnie.

Begins with wooden malts among a toffee sweetness with hints of cane sugar, which directly turns more present, accompanied by molasse. Burned malts settle the balance in this one, smoothing the way for a spicy coffee bitterness, wrapped up by soft cream, creating a smooth mouthfeel. High carbonation adds complexity and piercing force to the coffee, which punshes in a pleasant way through the slick sweetness, creating a convincing, diversified complexity. Finishes very smooth, sweetness turns coca-cola like for a split-second, soon getting detained by rich, roasted, unsweetened chocolate and coffee, along with wooden hints.","GERMANY","aleigator"

176,"2014-05-19",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 2-18-12 - 
Poured from bottle into pint glass

Appearance  Pours a deep-deep brown nearly pitch black color with a tan head. The head fades slowly and leaves a persistent foam on the top of the beer with some very nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Quite a nice look.

Smell  Sweeter chocolate aromas with a hint of vanilla and roasted notes are consistent throughout the entire aroma. Toward the end the sweetness lightens a little bit, and gives way to a slightly more bitter chocolate aroma.

Taste  The taste matches the aroma quite nice. The nose however leads you to believe it will be sweeter then it is. In the beginning it is a little bit of sweeter chocolate mixed with vanilla and a bit of roasted coffee. The sweet chocolate although, it is only sweet in comparison to where it goes, as over time it bitters more and more, to a bitter cocoa flavor with heavy roasted notes. 

Mouthfeel  From the look I expected something a bit more heavy and syrupy in body, but instead was met with something lighter. While lighter, it did have a very creamy feel, closer to something you may expect with a dry nitrogen driven stout. The level of carbonation and body made it very easy to drink.

Overall  This was a very nice porter. Although I dont think I would consider it Robust as the name implies, it is very drinkable and good none the less.","","Darkmagus82"

176,"2014-04-22",4.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. It had a best by date of 7/9/14 and came as part of a mixpack for $15.99 ($1.33 per bottle or $0.11 per ounce).

Appearance: Opaque black body with a large, fluffy, frothy, dark tan head which retains and laces extremely well.

Smell: Classic dark malty aroma with hints of dairy and milk chocolate and a faint floral scent.

Taste: I drink so many experimental style beers so often that I forget how good a beer brewed in a classic style can be. Smuttynose Robust Porter is a definite to-spec robust porter and would hit every note on a BJCP taste test. Its tasty and well-balanced, though not quite to the point of a being a mind blower.

The palette begins with a sweet taste of dark malts, and looking at the recipe on the brewerys website, theres quite a lot of them here. An interesting combination of milk chocolate, cola, and maybe a hint of cherry. It becomes a little bitter through the middle with a slightly toasty flavor. This grows stronger towards the end as the Cascade hops make their presence known and impart a slight citrusy or flowery taste. Additional notes of dark chocolate complement the bitterness well. 

Drinkability: The word robust in a beers name tends to imply strong flavor and a huge body, but thats not really the case here. Though the palette is plenty flavorful, Smuttynose Robust Porter is not intense or intimidating. The mouthfeel is calm and soft with a smooth texture and finish. It does leave a slightly dry aftertaste akin to burnt toast, but its easily tolerable. For 6% ABV, this beer has the right amount of taste for its weight and is satisfying just one serving at a time.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

176,"2014-02-02",3.0,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. A fairly unique aroma combination that starts with a notable earthy/mushroom and coffee mix. After a while, I started to pick up some raisins followed by some basement-dampness. As this warms and mellows, some light alcohol notes start to poke through with a medium strength cola-caramel smell. The dark brown body is topped by a thin, light-colored espresso head that leaves a trace amount of lacing. The taste is primarily coffee bitter at a medium level with a medium/medium-light sweetness. The tongue starts out with the cola-caramel flavors and some dark fruits (plums and raisins). The medium body has an average carbonation which is oily with a bit of a grainy feel to it. A toasted, borderline burnt toast, flavor finishes the drink and leaves a strong coffee and cola aftertaste that lingers.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

176,"2014-01-18",4.0,"12oz bottle served in a pint glass.

A - Pours a very dark brown(almost black). 2 fingers of dark tan foam cling to the sides of the glass and retains well creating a frothy cap.

S - Sweet roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, raw malts mix with roasted to create a complex aroma. Dark yeast, undercooked brown bread. Awesome!

T - Intense bitter dark chocolate overwhelms the senses. Full bodied coffee, acidic, roasted malt, hints of lactic and acidic berry fruit. Hops seem to bounce between pine and citrus at different times. Lightly sweet against the powerful coffee flavors. Bitterness goes from from to back transforming into a cocoa bitter finish.

M - Heavy body upfront but a thin liquidy feel towards the finish, light to medium drying carbonation. The finish is dry and bitter.

A dense and well....robust porter that will grab your attention for sure. The coffee and roast character is bold and very fresh. Dense and intense keep coming to mind. The mouthfeel starts full and creamy then quickly trasnitions into a thin dry finish. This is what I was hoping Founders Breakfast stout would taste like. My first Smuttynose and it will not be the last.

Nose is big and bright. There is a nice fruity scent of berries on top of a dark roasted malt. Coffee, chocolate and a light sweetness. There is no alcohol on the nose. It even has a faint touch of lemon rind that adds even more brightness. Caramel as the malt warms and some nutty qualities too. Its complex on the nose and as it unfolds it gets deeper and more vivid. 

Taste is so wonderful. Its the deft combination of dark roasted malt and those bright sweet fruits that greet the palate. Then you notice the chocolate and are delighted. The coffee is blended with it perfectly and they are inseparable. The malt is soft and it s caramel sweetness is full and with the nutty flavors it tastes sticky and sweet. It has a grainy edge to it and that is carried in the mouthfeel. The hop floral is faint but its there to add lightness to the body. Its hearty and creamy at the same time. The dark malt even imparts a bitter that keeps everything rolling across the tongue for a complex and rich drink without heaviness. 

Smuttynose has really done a terrific porter here. My favorite of its aspects is the light berry-like fruit. So many times dark fruits impart a heavier quality to a beer like this one but this is just buoyant on the palate. Balanced perfectly and drinks with a delightfully long aftertaste.

Medium body with a medium-high carbonation and an astringency that hangs on the tongue and lets u know its a robust porter. Overall, a good example of a robust porter, but it could be improved with a more complex malt bill.

176,"2013-04-07",4.0,"Rated 3/17/13. 12 oz bottle says 5.7%. Poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark brown color with good opacity for the style. The head is a two finger mocha shade. It takes a while for the head to recede away, and it leaves beautiful lacing down the glass.

S: This one is very forward in coffee, dry chocolate, roasted barley, and slight hop qualities. The hops come across in a faded manner - and honestly, thats a good thing.

T: The strongest note here is that of roasted barley, creating a coffee expression when mixed with the (faded) hops. The hops do come across a bit citrusy on the back end, but its balanced with the rich unsweetened chocolate and coffee flavors. Id say this is the perfect age for this one (two months before the best by date) - some hoppiness is there, just doing enough to balance any malty sweetness without providing an overbearing acidic nature.

M: I like how balanced the mouthfeel is: its dry enough to be easy to drink, yet theres enough of a lingering flavor to interest the palate. It could use a bit more body, but thats just nitpicking, really.

O: Not much to say here, its a great porter that Ive been ignoring for far too long. As I said before, this bottle is at the perfect age for consumption.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

176,"2012-01-20",4.2,"Bottle:
Another beer of this brewery with such a nice label. Still not sure whats awaiting me in that bottle.
Hmmm... An almost black pour with a nice black beer in the glass and a medium light tan/light brown head between vast and airy.
The smell is already incredible: roasted malts (almost as deep and complex as many imperial stouts), hint of burned rubber some fresh liquorice soaked hops, coffee.
The taste is incredibly strong and full of flavour, especially for such a low alcohol beer.
Nice roasted/burned malts and barleys, roasted coffee, burned wood, good bitter, coal, some fresh grass, hint of hops, some dark dried and smoked dark fruits and grains/herbs.
Damn this is strong and full of taste.
The bitterness grows and seems to get stronger towards the aftertaste.
The afteraste doesnt stay really long and isnt extremely present, but its still really good and full of roasted stuff, dried hops and good bitter.
Low carbo, soft and light spicy mouthfeel, full body and a texture between watery and creamy.
A very well executed Porter! Theres nothing here which I think anyone will dislike about this entire brew and its appearance (label, pour, beer in glass).","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"

Id like to sample this while sober sometime ; nothing too smutty about this beer,  but I recall from my almost nonsensical notes a good roasty coffee and aromatic hop showcasing. It looked very good in a tulip , giant beige head ,deep brown body , if almost like it could not be more comfortable in any other glass.

176,"2011-06-25",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2013 12 oz Bottle. The pour was a deep dark brown, almost black with an average (1-2 finger) frothy light brown head that reduced down to a thin puddled film, which lasted throughout and had some really excellent streaky lacing. 

The aroma was of burnt chocolate malts and a strong leathery yeast with notes of dark roasted coffee, molasses, dark bitter chocolate and a mild smokiness. 

The taste was mildly bitter-sweet and very malty with a bold chocolate note in the beginning, and then became a little more on the bitter side with a strong dose of coffee towards the finish. The flavor lasted a good long while following the swallow with a nice roasty coffee taste settling in on the taste buds. 

Mouthfeel was full in body and rather creamy yet slightly dry in texture with an mild carbonation. 

Overall I found this brew to be very Robust just as the name insinuates, and rather flavorful with a nice roasty characteristic. The mocha espresso taste made it very drinkable and quite enjoyable to sip on. This is a beer that most definitely does justice to the style...

Initial impression is of full and creamy mouthfeel - stout-like and very nice. The flavor is first sweet and not particularly complex,. malty, or roasty. No hop flavor. The finish is slightly harsh and burnt-tasting. My guess is that they used a pinch too much black malt and a pinch too little chocolate malt... the balance is off somehow.

176,"2011-04-23",3.5,"Picked this bottle up at Vintage Estate in Ohio. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

Pours nearly black with a thin light mocha head that disappears pretty quickly and leaves just a bit of a thin collar. There are a few bubbles on top as well. The nose brings some very nice dark chocolate along with a bit of roast. Chocolate is quite nice and hits well. The roast lingers in the background, but adds some complexity. 

The flavor hits pretty hard and offers up quite a bit of goodness. The chocolate and roast blend beautifully along with some lingering dryness and bitterness. Light amounts of espresso and molasses in the finish. Quite nice and doesnt really present any alcohol. There is a lingering bit of strange dryness in the long finish; almost cardboard-like, but I wouldnt call it oxidized. Medium-to-full body with moderate carbonation. Really quite nice and one of the better porters that Ive had in quite sometime.

176,"2010-11-18",3.5,"When an American brewer uses a term to strong, robust in this case, it usually means to prepare for a monster. That is not the case here and this is of relatively normal gravity for a porter of this country of origin and is rather good for a beer of any level of alcohol. The appearance is a nice, dark brown color. The head is small and tan and the lacing spotty. The nose is rich and roasty. It is mostly coffee w/ a maltiness that implies a bit of sweetness. The beer is only a tad sweet though, just enough to bring out some rich chocolate and mocha overtones. It is medium bodied w/ very reserved carbonation, which works quite well for the style. A mild earthy bitterness rounds things out in the finish. This is a nice beer, it is not strong but fully flavored.

There is a faint bit of resin in the aroma as well that shows its self later on. The flavor has plenty of roasty bitterness and bright hop presence. There are deep notes of vanilla and charred oak and a bit of licorice and berry as it warms.

Compact foam that seems pulled with nitrogen but isnt!
A bit yeasty but one of the first pints of a new just-agitated keg. So im sure itll clarify with time. The foam is surely long lasting. Tipical creamy, roasted robust porter nose with a scent of black olives.
On the palate licorice and earthy notes with a well established burnt and resiny bitter. Black olives as well.
A bit of CSA as the Smuttynose IPA tasted earlier, but still not too strong to bother.

Pours a near black pour, reddish brown at the edges, not quite opaque, but dark, a big billowy brown head that cakes at a good level, laces very well.

Initial is medium bodied, coats well, nothing overbearing, but good flavors throw roast, coffee, a touch of ashy smoke, faint nut, touch of chocolate. This beer is nice, a drinkable dark ale that doesnt weigh you down with sweeter dark malts, instead striking a good balance, nice flavors without being overdone.

176,"2009-03-29",3.5,"[Bottle] Pours dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma is very nice at first, with lots of chocolate, and very faint notes of dark fruits and smoke. As it warms, it gradually changes, taking on a more burned popcorn character that is not nearly as appealing and really quite astoundingly different from the initial smell. The taste has a fair amount of chocolate, but it is largely dominated by the charred malt that came out in the aroma. It isnt bad, but it makes it a little one dimensional. Medium mouthfeel with a long finish. Overall this was an interesting beer that I am glad I had a whole bottle of to drink. The aroma is so jekyll and hyde that had I rated this at a festival, or at a tasting, I would have most likely missed out on one of the phases that it goes through.

The aroma is a complex blend of earthy hops, sugar malts, sweetened espresso, bitter cocoa, and hints of dark fruit. Flavor is earthy and roasty with strong coffee. It has a strong flavor with very little sweetness, light earthy hop flavor, and subtle alcohol. Mid-palate brings firm earthy bitterness with some very bitter cocoa and light malt sweetness. The finish is sharply dry and bitter with hops and coffee. The mouthfeel is crisply carbonated - almost too much - with a dryness that coats and makes the medium-full body feel lighter. Overall, a very strongly flavored porter. The roastiness is intense  - but rich, not burnt or acrid. It is also surprisingly strong with earthy hops.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

176,"2009-02-21",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2009 (bottle) Pours black with a dark tan head and decent lacing.  The aroma is initially really bizarre, theres a good base of chocolate here, but theres also this odd aroma of butter and tartness.  Smells of must and wet dog as well.  This label with the dog on it is appropriate.  Taste is just heavily roasted french roast coffee, maybe some dark chocolate, but this is really walking that tightrope between being pleasant or astringent, and the circus theme on the label again describes this beer perfectly.  The obnoxious snap pea flavor is also noted right before the finish, which pushes it over the edge.  The finish is ok, with a bit of sweetness that rounds out to a light bitterness.  I hope this is just a bad bottle, because this beer was pretty disappointing. That was definitely a bad bottle, because this new bottle is so much better.  Nice chocolate aroma, with some hints of licorice and roasted malt.  Not must or wet dog this time.  Taste is really good too, some rich chocolate, perfect roast, and hints of tart berry skin.

Best Before 8/08

I received this in a recent trade with israel, thanks again! Smuttynose Robust Porter pours the darkest of browns that border on black. When the body is directly backlit there are very faint garnet hues throughout. A soft pour produced a swirling two fingers worth of khaki colored head. As it fell to the thick cap it settled at it became creamy and left some really nice sheet lacing down the glass. 

This porter has a really great nose. Its all at once roasty, nutty, and chocolaty. The roastiness leads the way and is accompanied by a nice mellow dark chocolaty goodness. Something along the lines of hazelnut comes through faintly here and there along with ghost like notes of maple syrup. The nuttiness seems to show up at different times. Each swirl of the glass brings a quick whiff of coffee grounds. 

The flavor falls just short of the stellar aroma but is very good none the less. The roastiness still has the spotlight and all the other aromas are there in the flavor although not quite as bright and vibrant. The coffee grounds and roastiness leaves a slightly bitter finish that makes this an all around solid porter. The nuttiness plays in the flavor too flashing here and there.

Robust porter sports a medium body with enough carbonation to keep things moving quickly. The roasty bitterness keeps growing as I drink. 

The drinkability is enhanced by the lighter body and solid carbonation. This is a porter than can be easily enjoyed a few at a time.

This is one of my favorite sessionable porters and I tend to pick up a sixer whenever Im in an area that carries Smuttynose. Robust Porter is incredibly easy to drink and very flavorful.

The head was actually a duo-color tan and chocolate, and it dissipated down to a thin layer that carried through the entire drink.  Aroma is even caramel, chocolate, rich roast coffee.  Frankly, Im not a big fan of coffee notes in porters, but this one is balanced as nicely as any Ive tried with that characteristic.  The flavor is an initial dark choco, almost sweet, with the coffee bringing up the rear, hangin out on the mouth.  The palate is mid-level heavy, which isnt surprising.  Theres also a smokey hazelnut coffee sort of oliy clinging that isnt quite as pleasant.  In the end, this is a very drinkable porter.  Nothing extreme, nothing paint-by-numbers blah.

Coffee flavors linger for quite a bit and coat the surfaces of my mouth with a dryness that I wasnt expecting.  Aftertaste is quite strong and has heavy hops and bitter coffee notes.  The hopping of this brew has given it a dryness that I have not found in many porters which have tended to be on the sticky-sweet side.

It pours black with a tall root beer-like head which was tan in color and demonstrated some durability.  Aroma was lots of dry roastiness with some measure of toffee, coffee, and chocolate smells.  The first flavor that hits you is a big amount of bitterness brought on by just how much dry roastiness there is in the flavor which is accompanied by some chalky mouthfeel, followed with a sweeter and smoother finish.  About half-way down the glass, the mouthfeel seem smoother and slicker as well.

Gorgeous Porter. Fully opaque with a huge tan head. At least 3 fingers thick and densely packed with bubbles, looks creamy as hell. Tremendous retention and phenomenal cobweb lacing. Some Imp Stouts wish they could look this good. Nose is chalky, full of chocolate and roasted beans, dark malts and grounds, with a hint of vanilla and licorice. Damn good smelling beer as well. Fore holds all of the elements of the aroma, chocolate and coffee mainly, but also vanilla and roasted malts. Its a bit of a step down from the intensity of the aroma, but still nicely done. Back end is very roasty and with a budding chocolate presence. Medium-full bodied, perfectly creamy mouthfeel for the style. Finish picks up some hop astringency, to go along with the sweetness and roasted notes that are present everywhere else. Great brew.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

Taste is equally if not more rich, dark and roasty and lightly bittered to perfectly balance.  Full bodied and just the perfect palate for a porter with light to moderate carbonation.

Crisp, medium-strong bitter attack on first tasting - activates and pushes the salivary glands into overdrive!  We want more!  Bitter coffee and bitter gourmet dark chocolate (though to a lesser degree) taste, roasty and salty with a nice overall malt-hop balance.  Faint touch of currant and a very nice, rounded, natural espresso flavor.  Medium-full body, smooth on whole (excepting the crisp beginning) with a dryish, nutty, salty aftertaste (somewhat reminiscent of licorice, though the edible kind).

176,"2007-07-24",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2013 (Bottle) Aroma a creamy roast, some vanilla manifests itself.  Dark, with a little foamy head--more head than I usually see on a Porter.  This Porter strikes me as a bit more stout-like than most porters.  Flavour: not very bitter.  Too sweet, but without the caramel taste that I like in many Porters.  Some roast emerges, a burnt tone here or there.  Some of the smoothness of a stout is present too.  Eh...I think this one falls short of the real top-notch Porters.  Its a good beer but it doesnt pack the punch that it ought to.  There is not enough bitterness...and theres too much of the burned flavor.  If the burnt flavor were diminished and replaced by more hops, this would be a top-notch brew.

Note: I drank this again, YEARS later (almost 6 years to be specific) and it was a completely different beer.  Much more bitter, much more roast, and less sweet.  But still, I would prefer hops.

Smell: Malty with currents of sweet chocolate and roasted coffee beans running throughout. Faint fruity scent, as well.

Taste: Like a demitasse of espresso served with a small square of chocolate melted within. Caramel. Grains. Hops are piney and they blend quite well with the other flavors. A touch sour. Lingering dry roasty finish. 

Will you people please just relax for two seconds? All the rich flavors will come together perfectly, trust me.

Mmm. There. Delish!

Mouthfeel: Nice and creamy. Just a hair above medium in body (medium-plus?). Carbonation remains light.

Drinkability: The first and only porter claiming to be ""robust"" that really delivered for me. Im positively nonplussed with amazement.

176,"2007-06-03",4.1,"5/11/2007:  Smuttynose Robust Porter pours a clear, very dark brown color (near black really).  The initial foamy brown head gives way to a lasting foamy crown after it slowly collapses down.  The aroma is rich and malty and contains chocolate malt, mocha cream, and a deep, smooth alcohol presence.  Very inviting!  The flavor is rish, robust, and complex, but controlled and not overwhelming.  At first the flavor is slightly sweet.  Bittersweet chocolate, hints of coffee and cream, and a dark chocolate bitterness arose the tastebuds.  Ther eis a deep, soft fruity quality as well as hints of well-integrated alcohol that run throughout the flavor as well.  The overall bitterness is balanced and has a blend of semi-sweet and dark chocolate flavor to it.  The finish is lengthy and roasty.  All of this flavor is contained within the medium-full body of this beer.  The palate is smooth and creamy.  Smuttynose Robust Porter is a great representation of a robust porter!

Pop the lid and you get that aroma of stout or porter, you know, roasty and burned wood. I must admit, it is a little milder smelling than most stronger porters. The color is opaque dark brown or black and there is a thin ring around the inside of the glass for a head. Barely any lacing around the inside of the glass as you drink. The taste has a bitter impact almost like a Baltic or imperial porter.  A little more personality than I care for in a porter.  The alky content is a little up front on the flavor, not quite in your face, but getting there. If I didnt see the % on this site, I would think it to be about 7%.  The carbonation is sparse but present, could use a bit more. Upon finishing this brew I get a back of your throat medium bitterness that hangs for a few moments.

Creamy sweetness intensifies at it warms.  Some pine and light citrus hops into the finish.  Hoppiness carries over into the bitterness, as well.  Palate:  Medium bodied.  Moderate carbonation.

Theres also a surprisingly hoppy character in the background. Body is extremely smooth with a creamy texture. Nice roasty malts give off a Bosco Chocolate Sauce flavor. The nice hop character to this Porter balances the malt nicely. It also gives it a subtle fruity note of orange peel. Theres also walnut hints. The finish is a nice balance of roasted espresso beans and hop bitterness. This is a great hoppy Porter.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Taste is really good, if it wasnt for the hops.  The underlying porter has a very roasty, smooth, coffee and chocolate thing going on with an incredible mouthfeel.

176,"2007-01-07",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Ive always understood a porter to be defined somewhat as a lighter stout.  I doubt this has any veracity to it, but its an impression that has kept me motivated to continue drinking beer without feeling like a total clod.  Stupidity or a sense thereof is a great way to keep somebody out of a hobby or academic field.  Even if my assumption is off, I like my porters expressive and bold, unafraid to put a little drama in their flavor.  The Smuttynose Robust Porter, one of their few beers available at the 2006 GABF, is a nice example of how I like it done.  A solid ebony body and a dark, oaken head (even in such a small glass) are good tip offs that its going to be something I like, showing no signs of weakness or cowardice.  Chocolate forms the foundation of the aroma, only slightly bitter, followed by the more natural and more sweet scent of molasses.  Those two aromas are accompanied by a Scottish peat smell that nuzzles up to the first two aromas with an impressive tolerance.  The final element of the smell that I could pick out was a sort of generic meatiness, maybe belonging to pork or beef, but something truly grizzly in its carnivorous foundation.  If theres one way to be bold, its to put the smell of cooked animal in your beer.  However, in the end, the Robust Porter is less robust than I expected, maintaining a level of flavor that sort of bumps around in intensity but never gets loud enough to really catch my attention (or my loving praise).  Its mostly coffee and alcohol, making up some imaginative bitter cocktail flavor, and then begins a strange presentation of peat and earthy vegetable flavors, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and potato.  Im pretty open to steamed vegetables, but I know many people arent, so this could draw a lot of ire from devout meat eaters.  Bold, yes, but maybe not as much as it could have been.  It tries to be tough, but chickens out at the last minute and keeps up just enough bravado to hang with the boys as a tough, but not tough enough porter.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

176,"2006-10-12",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2006 Pours a beautifully opaque near-black with a two-finger tan to light brown head.  There is an immediate chocolate and, surprisingly, raspberry nose which relaxes after about half a minute to a nutty, coffee aroma.  Definite hop presence.  As it warms, burnt toffee prevails.  Taste is upfront molasses and coffee with a nice hoppy bitterness.  Sweet malt is always present but never shouts.  A solid mouthfeel and soft carbonation.  The long finish favors bitter over sweet.  The head dimishes to a fine layer but never leaves.  Smuttynose has nailed a porter with a lot of character that could easily be a session beer.  Very well-balanced and thoroughly enjoyable.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","molarade"

The Smuttyness pours a rich and silkly looking dark blackish color with an extremely thin amberish tan head that quickly retreats.  The aroma brings out a hugely dark and robust roasted cocoay coffee (more on the cocoa side) nose.  Amazing aroma!!  The flavor is also very toasted bringing out a silky texture on the tongue at first with the tastes of roasted chocolate and malts.  It progresses slowly into a more coffee hopped finish, where the roasted coffee lingers on the palate for a bit.  Has a small lean towards a stout.  A seriously solid porter.

A delicate sea breeze salt and great roasted character. Deep black pool of liquid, with a rosy glint of North Carolina star sapphire, topped with a frothy swirling tempest of tan Stellwagen sea foam. Flavor continues along the lines of the aroma, but is a major dissapointment. The rich creamy malts soon fade into a watered down love. An alacrity of sewage pond vapors and angry bees cacophonates a incestuous steam train of weak coffee grounds, drippings from a melted Hershey bar, and a Margarita glass edged in Kosher salt. The oaky hull of a sloop fades into the distance of this beer, with biting cinnamon and lacksidasical roasted beet sugars. Palate maintains oak dryness.

This poured black with a thick coffee with cream head. Wonderful rich mocha and grass hop nose. A nice vanilla cream note to the aroma, I really like this aroma, some nuttiness mixes with the spicy hop I keep going back to coffee when I stick my nose in the glass, but it is not due to a roast note, although there is a bit of that, it is just that kind of rich sweetness that a chocolate coffee drink has, or one with a nice dose of Irish cream or somesuch. Thick cocoa biscuit flavor. Then a wet coffee ground flavor and a mocha finish. Christwagons, this is good. Nice finish of hops, grass mainly, but a bit of herbal flavor too that accents the cocoa and chocolate with a fine touch. Thanks for this bottle Sean, I will get more. As for the food in the oven, it smells fine, and the woman is still living back beyond a bridge I burned to the ground. The future looks better with beer this good.

Flavor is fairly dominated by the hops, but not the bittering hops, more of the aromatic hops contributing to the taste. This also gives it a grassiness which carries through the finish.

176,"2006-03-12",3.4,"Bottle:  Pours to a near-black brown, opaque when held to the light though it doesnt appear to be very murky or hazy.  A medium light brown head quickly forms and just as quickly dies, though it does hold a nice large ring around the glass.  The aroma is full roasted malt, roast coffee, mild chocolate, and a bit of fruit - plums, grapes, strawberry, and hints of smoke.  The taste is roasted malt and roasted coffee, but the roast flavors are not over the top.  There are also some notes of chocolate, dry spices, and a bit of charred wood.  Finishes with some charred wood and big roast flavors.  Medium bodied, full at times, kept nice and crisp in the mouth by fine carbonation.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
176,"2006-03-10",3.5,"(12 oz bottle: Chevy Chase Liquors in Washington, DC) This is a fairly old bottle, so aging has surely had an impact on this beer.  Very bubbly in structure, but with a creamy top, the tan head rises to nearly two inches on the pour before slowly ebbing to a quarter inch layer.  Jet black in color through every angle of the glass except at the extreme bottom edge where a bit of ruddiness sneaks out.  Ample flavors of yeast, chocolate, ash, charcoal, and bitter roastiness define this self-proclaimed ""robust"" porter, an apt description to be sure.  Slight peppery flavor accompanies a modest sourness that acts as a counterpoint to the light sweetness and its this spicy and sour traits that are somewhat of a distraction for me.  Ashy, bitter, roasty finish doesnt give the chocolate adequate room to breath.  Robust also describes the body, which while not thick and heavy, is still medium-full bodied, not bad for a porter.  The nose, however, is less aromatic than I expected, projecting a modest roastiness, so this is the one aspect where robustness is lacking.  Overall head retention is about as good as it gets, as an hour has passed and yet that quarter-inch head is still proudly on display.  Unfortunately, lacing is minimal with just a small slash across part of the glass.  Quite a nice porter overall.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Pours nearly black with glowing ruby highlights, hefty and rich looking, and with a thick and lasting brown head.  Lovely hoppy aroma is floral and resinous over top of deep and rich chocolate and (mostly) coffe malts.  As the beer warms, the coffee becomes the major player, pungent yet pleasant.  A smoky, grilled meat flavor emerges, sweet and caramelized, which compliments the persistent resinous hops.  I only wish it had a drier feel.

Bold and unforgiving black hue with a sadly shortlived creamy, tan head.  Im truly at a loss for a clever story here...instead, Im going to give you a recipe for excellent brownies, because thats what this beer brings to mind.  Youll need: 2 squares unsweetened chocolate, 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 c. sugar, 1/2 c. all-purpose flour, 2 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 c. chopped nuts (optional).  Melt chocolate and butter.  Remove from heat and stir in sugar.  Add eggs, one at a time.  Stir in flour, vanilla, and nuts.  Pour into a greased 10x6"" pan.  Cook at 350° for 30 minutes.  To bring it inline with this beer, consider grinding a handfull of espresso beans into a powder and sprinkling them on top.  Wonderful balance of rich chocolate sweetness and roasty coffee bitterness.  Hops could stand to be, well, nonexistent, but I can deal with them.  Significant body with an oily smoothness, broken only slightly by the carbonation.  Wie is de kleine krokodil?

176,"2004-10-14",2.9,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2004 2004 bottle.  From my oversized snifter this thing is just pitch black. I held it to a bunch of different lights and looked at it from all angles.  Black.  Huge creamy mocha head and a small amount of fine sediment at the bottom of the bottle.  Im going to start off by talking about the flavor because this beer is about one thing, black malt.  Wow.  It dosent come on heavy at first, but its definitely dominant even from the start.  Bitter, black roast coffee. Im thinking, ""Ive never done it, but I bet sucking on coffee rinds kinda tastes like this.""  Its not all coffee, roast and bitterness though, there is some lingering sweetness that peeks in, probably some light chocolate malt.  Rich and bitter it remains, with some black licorice notes as well.  On the finish, I detect some alcohol mixed in with the extreme bitterness.  Hops are done right, in its defense, making a big but not ridiculous appearance (or is it the bitterness from the roasted malt? the bitterness comes at you from every angle).  Towards the end of the bottle and after the beer has warmed fully, the black malt takes over completely and it just gets out of control.  My last few sips as I polish this off are all black, bitter, burnt notes.  The mouthfeel really saves this one though, adding a smooth, creamy, medium-full body, with only minimal carbonation.  It naturally follows that the aroma would be quite weak, as black malt does not tend to be a friend of powerfully full aromas.  Its a good roasty, lightly chocolatey aroma, but not what it should be for the force of this beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The only let down was that, in common with a number of the other US beers we sampled, the flavour was nowhere near as intense as the aroma.

Very tobbacy-o taste - this is remarkable. The palate is quite bitter, the taste isn't. It just seems to beg to have raisins in it, or to be drunk with a smoked sausage or a good Italian salami. I want to taste some hops, but they just don't emerge. Warming up, I do get the taste of bitter chocolate, filled with the raisins and rum. And, of course, tobacco. Very full-bodied, rich, without getting oppressive. Anyway you look at it, this is an impressive beer, the more as this isn't really my style. ""Kudo's"" as they say. BIG thanks to D.

Aroma of big columbian coffee beans, dark chocolate, milk blended in a rather low-profile expressiveness. Taste is also coffeeish in its malt development, but an unexpected strong piney/resinous/citrusy bitterness indicate a large hop presence and make the finish very long. Medium bodied and perhaps a tad overcarbonated, but I'm judging it against its Great Lakes rival. Good porter that wears its name with great pride, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected. I prefer the clean smokey/roasty to straightforward citrusy bitter finish I guess.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

A deep pool of black with edges of crimson….. the soft fizzy caramel head shortly stands then takes a nap. I take a whiff….. nose of coco, cappuccino, raisins and Smores; you know, marshmallow – gram crackers – chocolate – and campfire.
 The flavor is toasty and charred,   heavily kilned chocolate malts, lots of hard wood burning camp fire, rustic and heavy on the malt baby! 
 BRB, I need some water to cleanse the palate…………… Nope, it’s just that smoky & chocolaty…. Nice hops bringing up the tale end here. Silky palate, finish is a bitter/sweet dryness, Good toasty coco malty porter!

ReRate-bottle-Its been a long week and I havent had a beer in about a week.  I have been stressed with finals.  I decided to crack this one open from my secret santa box.  Like in the previous rating, it pours very dark for a poerter-about 92% black i would say.  Tan head that leaves a rim around the glass.  Its more viscus than many of the ilk.  Big chocolate aroma followed with hits of burnt char, earthy tones, chocolate chip cookies, and dark malt husks-wonderful!  This beer has a great mouthfeal.  the finish is long with lots of char, chocolate and those malt husks.  This is one under-rated porter. As the beer warmed, the aroma became even better, showing maple surup and a slight butterscotch note (and it wasnt diacytl) it has awesome balance and is a big beer for its style and abv.  I need more smuttynose beers!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

176,"2003-05-28",4.0,"Good pour, comes out thick like used motor oil. Looks similar too, until hit by light and then you can see reddish/copper hues. Smells of chocolate, coffee, slight hops and faint sweet spices tickle the inside of my nose. The creamy bone white head is appealing, though it dissipates rather quickly. First sip is a pointed attack of the hops on the tip of my tongue. I can then feel the limited bubbles wash over and off of my tongue and leave behind chocolate, toffee and coffee flavors. The aftertaste is dominated by espresso and chocolate, however smoky oak and toasted coconut make their presence known. The aftertaste lingers on until you lift your glass again, seemingly no matter how long you take; this is pleasurable. All in all, the Smuttynose is one of my favourite porters.

Pours very dark and thick. Small, creamy, well-tanned head. Not completely diminishing. Decent lacing. Only when held up to very brightl light can one see the lovely, clear ruby hue.
The nose is full of milk chocolate and coffee, vanilla, toasted cashews and allspice. Burnt flowers as well. Very nice!
The flavor is of espresso and bittersweet dark chocolate up front. Moderately bitter on the backside with hints of buttermilk and warm alcohol.
Full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Medium-length, dry, bitter finish with a hint of capuccino and freshly mown grass at the conclusion. A very hearty, well-hopped porter! World Class!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
