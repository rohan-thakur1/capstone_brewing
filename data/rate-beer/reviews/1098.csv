1098,"2011-05-21",3.0,"Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. Its a clear one, pale golden to yellow in color and with some white bubbles on top. The aroma reminds me more of a cider than a perry. Some barnyardish notes. The flavor is much the same, more evident on pears. Dry, slightly astringent and medium bodied. Lasting, mouth puckering, drying finish. A quite pleasant one, very dry and quite quenching. 110129","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
