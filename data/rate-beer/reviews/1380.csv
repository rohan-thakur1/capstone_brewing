1380,"2016-08-24",3.3,"Tap (Svatovaclavsky, Olomouc)
Dark brown, small tight head. Rich roasty aroma. Sweet, some cake-tin fruitiness. Light palate, crisp carbonation. Syrupy burnt body, but not sweet, quite well attenuated. An easy drinker. Malty dark finish. Rather decent, carbonation maybe a bit high, carbonic acid even detectable in the taste. Reminds me of treacle without the sweetness.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

1380,"2013-03-10",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
This aromatic Tmavy develops roasted coffee beans in a slender body leading to roasted bitterness and a touch of citrusy tartness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A superb head of foam thrones atop the blackness.
-The flavor profile was not as distinct as the nose.
-This brewer doesnt seem to shine with malts in the flavor profile.
-I preferred his hoppy brews, but this was still mighty fine.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
