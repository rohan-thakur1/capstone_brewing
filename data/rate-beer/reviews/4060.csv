Would have liked it to dry out a bit more at the ed, but perhaps that would have made it a bit harsh.

4060,"2017-06-10",3.8,"Crisp copper coloured body with a lighter orange and peach coloured tint, all with a thinnish, two centimetre tall off-white head. Aroma of citrus, light pine, a bit of floral notes and a smooth malt kick throughout, this one is nice and robust. Light to Medium-bodied; Assertive floral and grassy hop kick at first with a very smooth and subtle malt backbone showing some smooth yeast flavours as well and a hint of bread. Aftertaste is nice and mellow with only some of the hops coming out, but not a pressing bite nor any real pungency, just a nice balance and good flavour. Overall, a nice APA with a good profile, nice complexity, yet still smooth and easy-to-drink. Great to try, especially fresh and immediately after buying!

An appetizing beginning. Taste is up front bittersweet, with a mix of hops bitterness, and an underlying sweetness best described as a blend of honey melon and caramel. The finish turns quite bitter as the hops really come through and dominate. Body is medium, carbonation adequate, and there is even a touch of warmth at the end. Good fun for hops heads. Fun sipping.

The aroma reflected a nice blend of clean sweet malts, subtle crisp sweet and bitter pine. Lemon to citrusy pulpy sweetness.
The flavor took all of the previously mentioned aromas to blend nicely and lead into a sweet aftertaste with some subtle bitter piney/citrus notes. Semi-sticky sort of malty finish.

4060,"2016-10-05",3.8,"Bottle, with big thanks to Tom. I have a big soft spot in my heart for Alesmith. I came upon this whole beer world pretty late in life, and Alesmith entered the Seattle market right at the perfect time to grip me. I¬íd been lurking on ratebeer long enough to know how to use the search features, and had been drinking cool beers for awhile but was just starting to rate (in fact, a locally purchased Nut Brown was rating #18 for me). When I heard the chatter that Alesmith was coming to town, I did a little RB search and I¬íll be damned if they didn¬ít have the number 1 IPA, scotch ale, a top barley wine, and a top 10 beer overall, among others. So I went right out and bought a bottle of everything (well, everything except the grand cru, because that one was only rated high but not super high and why buy a beer lower than a 4.0 if I didn¬ít have to?). I brought them over to a cool beer-cognizant friend¬ís house to ""help"" him homebrew, and got to show off how much I knew about beer, telling everybody how these guys made some of the world¬ís best beers. And hell, I should know because I was a rater now, with 17 beers under my belt. In retrospect I¬ím sure I came off as a giant douche, but luckily I was with friends who could put up with my newfound enthusiasm. I¬íve (thankfully) mellowed since then, but I¬ím still a big fan of AleSmith, and even though I haven¬ít bought it in years I¬ím glad to know I can buy a 6er of their IPA at my local here in Cincinnati.

4060,"2016-09-15",3.8,"6-pack. Pours a cloudy medium amber with a dense and sudsy off-white head that lasts.This is the first clue that this beer might not be quite as fresh, or even quite the same, as the batches that made its reputation. I ordered a couple 6-packs on the gushing enthusiasm of several friends who¬íd been to SD, and the corroboration of all the great rates here. Everybody who could possibly flip for an APA appears to have flipped for this beer. But all the high rates here call it a bright gold, and what¬ís in the glass now is decidedly cloudy and dark amber. Grist bill change? What¬ís up with this? Nose shows biscuity, toasty malts, some caramel, and a decent dose of pine and grapefruit. There¬ís a good range of rates for this beer now, but some of the higher ones call out an insane array of diverse hop notes. Blame where it¬ís due here--CraftShack shipped these 6-packs, and the box sat for over a week after I ordered it. Could the beers have been on the way from the distro and that¬ís why the box sat? Sure, possibly. But most likely it was CraftShack sitting on bottles that were getting no younger.Medium body with moderate carb. A tiny bit flabby for an APA, but this is the sort of thing that would go away with a bit more brightness from a proper hop bill, which might have faded somewhat now. Still, there¬ís a nice toasty caramel, with biscuity notes, and some good pine and grapefruit presence. This is a pleasant easy drinker, but hardly the explosive and finely-tuned flagship that so many have described. I definitely expect to bump up this rate if I ever get to SD.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

4060,"2015-10-06",4.0,"Sampled April 2015
A steady pour into my IPA glass produces a two-finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a nice copper color that shows a brilliantly clear, almost metallic, bright copper hue when held up to the light. Even as I pour this beer it smells dense, juicy, and ripe with tons of hop fruit character. Screaming kumquat zest, amped up guava, tangelo zest, gooseberry concentrate, floral laden, tropical, slightly spicy fruit preserves just ooze from the aroma here.

Light bodied, with a perceived sweetness from the juicy hop character, but the beer finishes dry, and with a soft bitterness that is fairly clean. Peppery, with a slightly dank, herbal character up front that is backed by an ample, fruit character that contributes flavors of kumquat preserves, guava, spicy ripe mangoes, and a concentrated, floral peach character.

This is a really nice beer, if you like super hoppy, without bitterness, and with a supporting malt character then this should be right up your alley. I really like that this is only 6%. It is so well balanced, and not overly dry, which for me, really kills the juiciness of the ripe, fruity, hop flavors that beers like this should have.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

>>> An heavily drinkable Pale Ale with AleSmith malt signature and an amazing balance.

+  Drinkability is very high, thanks to a wondeful balance, good carbonation, clean mouthfeel and delicate malt backbone 
+  Like almost every AleSmith beer, the malt backbone is perfect for the beer. Subtle, but with a perfect honeyed and crackery touch and a mild spiciness that add some depth
+  There¬ís a moderate herbal/resinous bitter finish that add some punch to the beer, but it also dissipates quickly to leave a dry impression. Too often with these beers, the bitterness is sticky and hinders drinkability/enjoyability. This is not the case here 
‚àí  Aromatic features were not as bright as described by some others, but it might very well be because the bottles is a few weeks old if not more already

Glass: Stone Ruination IPA pint glass 
From: Trader Joe¬ís in Mission Valley (San Diego), Calif. 
Price: $2.00 
Purchased: June 26, 2015
Consumed: June 27, 2015
Misc.: I¬íve had a taster of this, but this will be the first time I¬íve reviewed it.

Poured a paleish, orange, clear color with 2-to-3 fingers of off-white, frothy head. Just a few bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Average, uneven lacing on the sides of the glass. Good retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 4.25)

Very nice on the nose. Getting Simcoe, Mosaic, Citra, grapefruit zest, pine, tropical, mango, resin (on the back end), pineapple, floral and orange blossom. Reminding me slightly of a Duet and, to a lesser degree, Nelson. Smelling more like an IPA. Lovely. (Smell - 4.75)

Taste wasn¬ít nearly as good, but still decent. The hop flavor isn¬ít as potent either. Still getting Mosaic, Citra, floral, pine, grapefruit pulp, tropical, pineapple, mango, nectarine, orange blossom, peach and apricot. Could practically taste pulp. (Taste - 4.13)

Light body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Clean, crisp finish. Goes down well. (Feel - 4.00)

This was much better than the last time I tried it at the brewery. Very good. (Overall - 4.25)

Flavor of caramel, tea, honey, grass, citrus, herbs, florals, and sweet cereal. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and an incredibly smooth mouthfeel. Smells amazing and drinks so easy.

4060,"2015-06-12",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
From this smashing American Pale Ale rise flowers, citrus fruit and honey, a perfumy profile balanced out by fierce bubbling and resinous bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A healthy head of foam covers the translucent golden. Head retention is impressive too.
-The finish is relatively easygoing, which increases drinkability.
-That aroma is something else.
-The flavor profile is perhaps not as bright as the aroma. There is a quiet moment in the middle that 
-This one was better quite cool.

4060,"2015-01-27",4.1,"Pale ale. Too light for me these days, generally, as the hops aren¬ít as pronounced as I really enjoy and so many brewers go so light-bodied that the texture isn¬ít as pleasurable for me. This is a definite exception.

All of the fine things in a beer are presented to me when I crack the cap and breathe it in. Fresh pine, caramel malts in a soothing aroma and a sea-salted butter cookie underneath it all. This is one of the most aromatic pales I¬íve ever enjoyed. I could almost get away with breathing it in for hours for the warmth and buttery goodness of it; but my mouth is craving it, and so therefore I drink.
The brew is clear as glass, rich amber, covered in a heavy foam, the head displays its artistic lacing in a golden-white, thick and sticky.
The flavor is rich as well. Buttery caramel is absolutely up front, accented with a light pine that must have been soaked in grapefruit for hours, melting in my mouth and making me realize that I¬ím almost out of this delicious stuff!
The taste is mellow, the bitter there, and as completely hoppy as I need it to be, but so smooth that you could feed this brew to anyone and convert them to craft. The finish is only slightly dry, sticky and almost sultry. This liquid slips over my tongue; creamy and sexy, not too sweet, not too bitchy.
