2050,"2015-09-16",3.4,"Bottle... Pours deeply amber with copper highlights and a small, fleeting, white head. The aroma features tons of rich caramel and a light splash of young port. Full-bodied with soft carbonation. The flavor is bright, tart, fruity and malty. Finishes tart, tangy and fruity. I have no clue what fruits are in here, but they work.

2050,"2015-09-13",3.7,"Poured a muddled orange rust color with aromas of light wet wood, v8negar, some light fruit and wine. Flavors Marche the aromas spur and vinegar with some light port notes, and wet wood. Solid overall.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2050,"2015-07-16",4.1,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is fruity with a faint citrus note and moderate pineapple and tropical fruit. Some light colored berry and stone fruit notes with a bit of pear. Light grape notes and hints of oak. Light alcohol spice. Light caramel malt notes. 
Pours a slightly hazy, reddish brown/ burnt auburn with medium small, somewhat thin, dark tan head that recedes to the edges where it lingers. Light lacing and medium small legs. 
Flavor is lightly acidic with a medium light sweetness. Medium light malt notes of caramel and light toasted bread. Rather fruity with light citrus, moderate tropical fruit, moderate grape and stone fruit, light pear, berry and cherry. Medium low bitterness. Light alcohol spice and light oak. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a very fruity and tasty beer. Im not usually a fan of darker, acidic beers but this tastes really light and fruity even if it is approaching an amber or brown color and has some malt presence. Oak is light, but complimentary and the alcohol is well hidden. Only lightly acidic.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Nose shows notes of oak, red wine, port, funk, light herbal notes. Flavor continues suit with heavy barrel influence with notes of port, spearmint, herbs, and funk.

Nothing really specific, though, just fruity. Body is medium and so is carbonation. Juicy/vinous. A good one but not a great one.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

2050,"2014-05-04",3.8,"Draft at De Garde, Tillamook. Pours a very cloudy medium yellow-orange, decent amount of off-white head. Aroma is very port-forward, but with some estery notes as well. Body is full and rich, not much vinous notes, but catching a hint of woody bite. Slight booziness at tail end, with some grain character as well.
