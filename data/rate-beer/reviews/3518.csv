3518,"2015-11-16",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2015 Tasted on tap in a shaker glass at ElijahPs in Alton, Il. It poured a near-opaque brown colour with sudsy beige foam, long-lasting with a little lace. Aroma was low but pleasant, flavours matched and were much bigger: super malty, bready, biscuity, chocolatey, hint of bright coffee acidity, tannin-y like nuts or strong black tea. Non-deScript hops which provided a balanced bitterness, but little else. Light-medium body, moderate carbonation, nice alcoholic strength, dark malt complexity lasts well into the aftertaste. Reminiscent of The Civil Life American Brown except less hoppy. Lost Abbey Red Poppy is one of my all-time favourite beers, and English mild is my all-time favourite style, so Ive been hoping to taste this base beer for years, ever since learning of the connection. What a treat, AND its as delicious as Id hoped, which is not always the case with these long-term obsessions. Its easy to see how it holds up so well to tart cherries and hardwood aging.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

3518,"2014-06-13",3.8,"18th March 2014: on-tap in the Hopping Pig, San Diego. The best beer on my first flight of four. Came a clear reddy/brown dark amber with a full beige crown. Malt notes fill your nose and mouth with chocolate being the strongest noticeable, caramel and toffee follow closely behind. This isnt a sweet brew though, it is balanced with a fruity, piney hop undertone that stops the malts running away with the brew. Tasty and unexpected in San Diego, glad I came across it.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

$3.00 for a world class mild ale that serves as the base for a beer I have been dying to try for years? People in San Diego truly are spoiled when it comes to choice. A mild ale that would put almost any in England to shame this has a little bit of a West Coast attitude as well.

Aroma / Appearance - A chestnut base is as rich as the inside of a peanut butter Buckeye. Absorbing all light, it is paired with a pleasing dusty head. Nuttiness lingers in the air with the smell of gentle hops that bind together the aspects of everything a mild ale should be.

Flavor / Palate - The feel of fresh summer iced tea hits the tongue with a refreshing presence. It is tough not to just drink the entire thing in a few sips and order another. The creamy mouthfeel progresses towards a mild bitter conclusion rich in flavor while still delicate enough to be sessionable. If this is the base for Red Poppy I can not wait to crack open a bottle.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
