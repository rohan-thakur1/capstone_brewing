3079,"2017-03-23",4.5,"12floz bottle without freshness dating purchased about six months ago from consumption date 03.23.2017. Note a label change from Unplugged to a thumbprint design. Paid $3 for a single. Poured vigorously into a normal sized nonic glass. Appears dark brown with a pillowy light-tan head. Nose invites me to a feast of a drinking experience. Aromatics are of woodsy smoke, such as a campfire. Some smoked meat is in there as well. This transcends to robustly balanced palate hickory and a touch of cocoa. Creamy upon first taste, then it following through with smokey and mildly roasted. I wonder if this would go with BBQ. Yet, it tastes like a BBQ. So maybe not enough to contrast. Ok, I got it. Steak and taters would seem to be appropriate. Its been a while since I last had a really good smoked porter. This ranks up there with Alaskan as a contemporary.","","balloonbuffoon"

3079,"2016-12-16",3.9,"Got in a trade with the The-Adjunct-Hippie. 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/4/2016. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that linger. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big peat smoke, wood, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, and herbal; with lighter notes of caramel, charcoal, fruit, leather, pepper, and roast/smokey earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. A bit too fruity/peaty in the nose, but not overwhelming. Taste of big peat smoke, wood, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, and herbal; with lighter notes of caramel, charcoal, fruit, leather, pepper, and roast/smokey earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy hop and roast/char bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peat smoke, wood, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, herbal, light pepper, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from roast/hop bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.1%. Overall this is a very nice smoked American porter style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Other than the aromas being a bit off; this was spot on for an American porter in every way. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3079,"2016-12-06",4.0,"Its pretty crazy that Wisconsins best brewery (OK, top 3 at worst) doesnt have a standard porter among its dozens of beers. Its even crazier that the smokiness is so well balanced, considering that most smoked beers Ive tried seem like pyromaniacs projects gone wild. Smoke on the Porter has a smoky sweetness throughout the aroma and taste. It makes me wish Dan Carey would make a few more porters and maybe just a plain one (which Im certain would be anything but).",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"

3079,"2016-08-22",3.8,"12 ounce bottle from Badger Spirits in Janesville, WI (July 2016), served at cellar temperature in a New Glarus Glass. Not-quite-opaque black body topped by a very creamy taupe head, slowly diminishing...light to moderate smokiness in the nose, mostly typical porter dark roasted malts; I know porters are pretty popular to hit with the smoker, but this is not the first time Ive thought that the Germans have had it right all along - smoking lagers gives you a stronger smoky intensity just about every time; if youre using smoked malt in something that already has a lot of roastiness and sometimes comes off as smoky, whats the point? anyway its a nice nose, but its got nothing on Schlenkerla thats for sure...on the tongue, its a bit more distinctive I think, with a lovely velvety semi-sweet initial flavor, lots of sweet caramelized malts here, giving way slowly but implacably to an almost overwhelming finishing bitterness and burnt character that verges on harshness...the full body and soft mouthfeel and low-to-moderate carbonation are well-judged, and this ends up a pretty impressive experience after all, even if its not going to displace any of my favorite smoked lagers anytime soon...","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Pours a quite dark black/brown with some reddish tints and an offbrown head leaving some drippy lacing. Aroma has smoke, and also chocolate and licorice and roasted malt. Taste is of salty meat smoke, sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Nicely balanced between the ""smoke"" component and the ""porter"" component. My memory of this fresh two years ago was more smoke-y and not as much porter-y, but that is anecdotal. This is quite yummy.  Medium to full bodied. Could be more chocolate/roasty rich, in my opinion, but that angle perhaps would kill the smoke. Finishes slightly bittersweet, and a touch smokey. This is a nice one.

Taste is smooth roasted malt and smoke -- but the smoke isnt overpowering. Thats really the key for me -- I didnt want to drink a campfire, but they dialed it back just enough to add to the beer without defining it.

3079,"2009-01-21",4.0,"A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass nets me a two-finger thick, lightly browned, tan colored head.  The beer is quite dark, with a burnt, concentrated brown color.  When held up to the light the beer shows an almost opaque darkness, but does show some flashes of murky, concentrated amber around the edges.  The aroma has the hearty aroma of smoked malt, it smells quite similar to beech-wood smoked malt, though perhaps a touch softer ad less meaty.  Underneath the chewy smoked malt character are notes of roasted grain; a touch of char, a rich toasted whole grain character and as the beer warms a bit, rich notes of dark chocolate and city roast coffee beans.  I really like that the smoke is distinct, dominant even, but doesnt drown out the beautiful dark malt aromatics here.

Fairly light bodied, almost thin in some ways.  The beer is also quite dry tasting up front, with even a touch of roast grain derived acidity to it.  The smoke adds some richness to the flavor, but isnt quite as prominent as it was in the aroma.  The dark, roasted malt notes play a significant, almost leading role here; roasted cocoa, well toasted whole grain bread crust, blackened toffee and, in the finish, a bitter, burnt grain note  and some charred acidity lingers on in the palate.  The smoke seems to accentuate, or perhaps even contribute to a certain sweetness here in the finish.  As the beer warms up it starts to gain in richness and texture; the body has more viscousness to it and it feels fuller as it rolls across the tongue.  The malt sweetness also is magnified as the beer warms up, this works really well with the smokiness and even adds a touch of dark fruit character up front.

This is quite a nice beer.  I really like the mix of flavors from the smoked and the roasted malt mix.  My biggest complaint is that a 12oz bottle is not nearly enough of this for one sitting.  This is one of those beers that started out a bit slow, but finished up great.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The mouthfeel is creamy on the tongue but not at all thick; it swallows a little watery.  As it warms, the chocolate becomes less pronounced, and the smoke gains some breadth, not so much bacon, more peat and aniseed.

How: Bottle 12oz.  One of the bottle I got from the simultaneous generosity of mreush, ughsmash, Stine and Kingpinipa.  A conspiracy Im telling you!!!
The look: Black body topped by a very small tan head
In long: Nose is very smoky on top of rich molasses.  Taste is a whole bunch of fruits in molasses.  The fruity flavours here go way beyond the usual porters dark fruits.  Grapes, berries, figs and even some lighter dessert fruits such as pineapples and kiwis providing a nice tartness.  Smoke is there and roastiness level is moderate but its really the fruit flavours that come out the most here.  A little hard-candy sweetness.  Everything comes together very well in this beer.  Smoky but not too much, complex fruitiness, lively carbonation, light astringency in the finish, nice roastiness and molasses backbone.  A very good beer.  As fruity and smoked as my senile aunt Lucie on medicinal marijuana.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Not so much a Rauchbier, but more of a pleasant experience similar to that of Alaskan Smoked.  Good stuff, but not something I would want to drink alot of - smoked beers are not my forte.

Woah - a pungent, noticable, complex aroma: coffee, floral, citrus.  The flavor is equally exciting - solid coffee taste, sweet malts, and fruit.  Then comes a real kicker - gentle hops and a rich sort of wood smoke, reminiscent of campfires and tasty smoked meat.  A little weird, but it works out very nicely!

The smoke is a little less evident up front in the taste with the sweetness of roasted malts and molasses hitting first.  This gives way to a bit of the chocolate and dark fruits before the smoke makes itself felt in the finish, lingering nicely.

3079,"2008-05-29",4.1,"The aroma is smoky, and meaty witht light hints of roasted malts, and a little caramel sweetness. The color is a very deep brown with a fluffy white head. Considering the very smoky aroma, I expected this beer to taste a little smokier, however at the front of the mouth this brew just tastes like a really fantasic porter with great flavors of chocolate, cherry, oak, & coffee. However mid-mouth the flavor gets intensley more smokey with better woody and meaty flavors. The beer finishes with a good dryness. 
The texture is creamy and smooth.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

A nice combination of smoke, chocolate and roastiness on the nose.  A little too well balanced for my tastes, Id like to see the smoke out front a little more.  The smoke is pretty muted on the flavor, theres a lot more chocolate and roasted malt than smoked.  Really tasty and flavorful, but not as smoky as I was hoping for.  Theres a good bit of smokiness late on in the finish though, with just a touch of smoked meat notes.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a texture that would pass for creamy were it not for the slightly overactive fizzy carbonation.

I actually prefer smoked beers with the subtle smokiness to them versus the brash in your face variety.  This beer almost doesnt have any smoked qualities to it, so in that sense, I almost feel let down.

Seems like it uses oatmeal too.  Beechwood or applewood smoke.  Salted meat and juniper berries.  Spruce hops.  The flavor is very balanced with sweet milk chocolate, acetic smoked malts, juniper berries, and spruce hops.  Things in this reminds of the Norwegian Wood beer.  The palate is perhaps a touch over-carbonated and leaves my mouth watering with a thin, slick body thats dry and astringent.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

The aroma is smokey, the smoked ham Bamberg style smokey that I love, underneath the heavy smoked malt, some coacoa/chocolate notes were detected. The flavor is solid, theres more balance between the smoked malt and the coacoa/chocolate notes so it feels less like a rauchbier and more like what a smoked porter should be, in the end some dryness is felt and the smoke feels a bit woody.

Folks talk of bacon, but I dont get it.  I LOVE bacon, the smell of it, the taste of it.  But I never get that in heavily smoked beers.  I get the aroma of ashes and a flavor akin to adding water to the bottom of your grill after cooking.  This wasnt quite that bad but the smoke didnt have the subtlty of ofther smoked beers Ive enjoyed.

I dont want to say this is unsubtle because its not overwhelmingly smoky, but its definitely more assertive than a lot of smoke beers Ive had.  The smokiness doesnt cover up the nice roasty, chocolatey porter characteristics, which is nice.  In addition, the smokiness is a nice crisp, appetizing smelling smoke.

I hate to use the word ""balanced"" to describe a smoked beer, but thats really whats going on here.  Clean malt aromas of chocolate and mild toast come through in equal parts with the smoke.  The smoke is rather similar to the quality of the Alaskan Smoked Porter, but the level is a bit less.  I want more of that ham, bacon, and salty intensity.

Pours brownish black, not quite as dark as a porter as Id expect.  Head is nice and big and tan.  Nose is smoke city, meaty, roasty and rich.  Taste evokes the same kind of smoke as in the nose, in some ways this is like drinking meat, but its beer.  Sometimes I dont know how I feel about smoked as a style.

Warming really opened this one up - I would have been maybe 3.6 or so initially - glad I waited.  Terrific porter aroma - deep roast nutty/chocolate malt, smelled oily and rich, with molasses and dry herbal bitterness; over all of it rode strong but not overpowering hardwood/peat smokiness.  The taste followed, deep rich nutty roast and coffee, the earthy peat and herbal bitterness were more pronounced.

Reminds of the old fish smokehouse in Port Washington, WI just north of where I grew up.  Not overbearing, but great aroma.  Flavor contains smoke up front with a great dry malt balance.  Essences of smoke and wood and burnt caramel.  A bit of biscuit too.  Finish is clean from the dryness.  Medium body smooths everything out just perfect.  Best smoked porter I have had.

3079,"2008-02-22",4.1,"12 oz. bottle either from joeybgood or secret santa, thanks to both.  Pours an extremely dark brown with mahogany highlights.  Good sized creamy beige head leaves delicate lacing.  The nose is the perfect amount of smoke along with chocolate and roasted and caramel malts.  The flavor is much like the aroma.  Nothing dominates and it works well together.  Smoke, roasted malts, caramel malts, and chocolate all in balance.  Medium bodied and creamy smooth.

Medium bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation, and a creamy finish.  Long duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

In fact, there is the feeling of smoke in my throat.  The palate is rich and creamy.  This one is good.  Later - I seem to be burping up smoke house meats.

3079,"2008-02-17",4.1,"Aroma of woodsy smoke with some light toffee and caramel. The nose is certainly very subtle, but inviting nevertheless. The beer appears black with red tints and there is a sand colored one finger head. The sweet malt, nuttiness, and cream is the first thing you taste before the smoke saunters in. The smoke is the dominant flavor, though it never seems hammy, artificial, or overpowering, some of the things than can take away from other examples of the style, at least fresh ones. The sweet maltiness and roast in the underlying porter really help the beer shine. This really is one of the most rounded smoked beers, porter or otherwise, that I have had. The New Glarus Unplugged series seem to be one winner after the next. Well done!","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Aroma is a thick and pleasant barbecue smoke with a touch of fresh cut wood notes and chocolate malts hiding behind everything. Really nice flavor that starts with a strong smoke statement with a touch of saltiness that re-creates the nose of a true meat smokehouse! Nice! Dark chocolates are found throughout with robust black malts. Medium bodied with a carbonated sting in the finish, slight bitterness lingers, but the smoked notes fade rather quickly.

A bit of a tan head stuck around.  Smoked, malty aroma, very mild.  But the flavor, wow.  Smoked flavor really cut through, but it gave way quickly to a sustained malt taste with delicious chocolate notes.  Again, this is a full-bodied beer, and one can definitely feel it.  I was a bit disappointed that the smoke flavor didnt linger, but some may enjoy its nuanced character.  Overall a great porter.","Washington, USA","cblado"

3079,"2008-02-09",3.7,"Very nice, but this wants to be a Porter much more than it wants to be a Rauchbier, and my preference is for the latter.  Nice pour, a nearly black dark brown body with a substantial beige head that coats the glass with spidery Belgian lacing.  The aroma is fairly strong with the bacon and smoked ham, but then the roasted malt trailed by some chocolate surges in too aggressively and lessens the effect.  The bacon-sausage-ham bounces back even stronger in the flavor, the barley-coffee-chocolate letting it run the show.  Very nice beer, but Id like it more if NG meated up the aroma some more.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

Thats about all that I get is smokey with a faint maltiness. Awesome. The taste is the best part. This beer explodes with flavor as it crosses my lips. Lots of smoke and super toasty malts abound on this one. The mouthfeel is the second best part, the carbonation is vibrant and active. It helps to move the flavors around my mouth.

3079,"2008-02-07",3.6,"Courtesy of gillard. Poured dark brown with tan head. The aroma hits you with a pulse of smoke and wood before faint roasty malts are noticed behind the smoke. The taste begins with nice smokiness that leads into bacon wrapped wood. Theres also faint roasty malts hidden somewhat by the smoke. So the base beer is a bit lost. I do enjoy the level of smokiness here.

A decent amount of lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of bittersweet chocolate, charred malts, and moderate smoke.  The flavor consisted of mocha, vanilla, burnt wood, smoke, cold coffee, and a mild bready yeast note.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with light carbonation.  A nicely done porter, but I would have prefered the smokiness to be a bit more aggressive.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

This has a very nice smokey aroma of a campfire with some smoked meat and sausage being cooked. The flavor is very roasty and smokey as well. It isnt too smokey though to where it is not enjoyable though. Flavors of smoked sausage, smoked malts, and dark chocolate all come through.

The flavor showed a bit more of a subdued smokiness, with coffee taking a more prominent role.  Some oaky vanilla and cream add smoothness, while a touch of cola adds some caramel or molasses sweetness. The mouthfeel is substantial, but its a touch over carbonated and chalky for my liking.

Smells of a good amount of smoke, that typical campfire/Sunday morning breakfast aroma that is so pleasant.  Not a total smoke bomb, but certainly prevalent.

The aroma has notes of smoked meat and smoked wood, hints of coffee, chocolate, herbal hops, and a touch of fig. The taste mostly follows suit with a dry smoky wood character upfront supported by some ripened fleshy fruit, chocolate and walnut. The finish shows some coffee and perhaps some hop bitterness. The mouth feel is lively and thin (yep it is a porter) with a dry chalky finish. Overall a solid solid porter where the smoke is forward but does not cover up the malt completely.

Almost like opening a bottle of liquid smoke at first, but mellows out nicely to reveal a Carmel-dark fruit base. The flavor is a wallop of smoke followed by sweetness followed by a nice hop finish.

Thanks to Ughsmash for sending some of these my way.  It is one of the things Ill miss most about Wisconsin (though the selection here almost makes up for the lack of readily available New Glarus).  Ive been eagerly anticipating this one for a while to see how it would stack up against the Smoked Rye Bock.  As it turns out I think the two may be roughly equal.  The smoke does different things to each but the end result is the same - a solid one-off bottling.
Aroma / Appearance - The best part of this beer is the aroma.  I could have spent hours soaking in the smoked chestnut, coffee and fireplace scents.  It has more smoke to it than the Rye Bock but is not overpowering.  Dark fruity undertones tease at what could be inside as with most of the Unplugged series.  The pour resulted in a dark brown body with clear lacing and sandy head.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was perfectly balanced.  Not too thick and not too thin, I was able to pick up ash, cocoa and burnt marshmellows.  Blackberries and cherries unfolded next.  The finish of smoked ham reminded me of the Back Road Christmas Porter from a few years ago.  For the time of year this is the perfect beer.  The smell of a yule log burning in the fireplace would complement it well.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3079,"2007-12-04",3.8,"Opaque and cherry black in the glass with a tan wrung hugging the edges. Aroma rides the smoked hide and branded leather with lovely complexity. Fire scores the dark chocolate lingering by the hazelnuts for a symphonic smore and match made in smoked heaven. Flavor aligns more lightly than the deep delving nose had indicated, annunciated by heavy carbonation and a lacquered based body. Singed graham crackers and soot mingle with mocha grinds and apple wood to create the dark chocolate composure avec dry smoky accents. Bakers chocolate gets charred as the tongue lightly licks branded leather. The body maintains a medium balance while the substance remains mainstream, echoing with smoky dark chocolate for a lovely flavored finish to establish a worthwhile endgame.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

3079,"2007-12-01",3.8,"I agree that this beer is pretty good; and a fine example of this ""Unplugged"" series, which has been a bit hit&miss to me.  This beer is smoke-y and a nice sampling of summer sausage flavor Ive found in other smoked beers without the challenging intensity that some of those beers offer.  Quite nice.

This beer pours a non-viscous but rich black that is nearly opaque.  Head was rich and composed of tiny off-white bubbles.  Intially, I had maybe 2cm of it atop my pint glass although this faded to 5mm coating that covers the breadth of my beer (rim to rim coverage on the glass).  Aroma is a bit smokey, and offers some summer-sausage aroma that Ive found in other beers, like Schlenkerla, although this beers smokiness is not overpowering in its intensity.  The smokiness is up-front in this beers flavor; I get a lot of the smoked-sausage taste right at the beginning and in the front of my mouth.  At the finish the dark roastiness becomes evident.  I think this beer would be pretty good without the smokiness; I dont get the impression that the smokiness is covering up anything unpleasant.  Mouthfeel is very dry and cinder-y.  This beer is very drinkable for a smoked beer (without being boring)...most beers of this style are more challenging for me to drink than this particular example.

I would highly recommend this beer, even if youve not enjoyed other smoked beers.  I picked up a 12oz single of this at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

3079,"2007-11-27",3.9,"11/27/2007:  Smoke on the Porter is dark brown in color, clear, and has a small foamy tan head that slowly fades.  The aroma has a nice amount of smoke that is subtly meaty and accompanied by roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate, and black, espresso roast coffee.  Lots of rich, smooth  chocolate (semi-sweet and dark) graces the tastebuds at first.  There is also a nice, balanced level of residual sweetness.  The maltiness is then followed by a perfectly balanced and well-intergrated smoke that really isnt meaty or burnt, but something in the middle like caramelized marshmallow with some char.  The finish tastes something like milk chocolate covered smoked expresso beans followed by really, really dark chocolate.  It is really quite delicious.  The body of this beer is medium-full and it has a smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel (probably due to the lighter than usual carbonation level).  I really like this beer, but the smoke is so subtle at times that it would be quite easy to miss it altogether (my wife didnt pick up on it at all).

Milk, cocoa, and lightly cooked bacon aroma; bonfire, and a hint of cold-press french roast, though its acridity is restrained and playing comfortably into the larger context of thick sweetness.  Flavor suggests lactose sugar, honey, berries, and heavy dark malts; mild astringency.  Acerbic, brash cola and licorice sweetness, smoke being less prevalent than vanilla and sarsaparilla tones.  Lemon touch.  Palate is somewhat too light, with a slight sharpness; this tends to lend an inordinate strength to those cola tones.  Ashen coffee ground finish.

3079,"2007-11-17",4.0,"A bit effervescent, then the head dies to a really small sustained ring. Deep dark mahogany, smells of wood and a bit of bacon, caramel and pepper. Smoky and sweet, with a sourish meaty presence (umami) rolling around on the tongue. The sweet part is just a bit of brown sugar. A bit astringent in the flavor, and thats OK, but the thinness detracts a bit. Thanks Ughsmash!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3079,"2007-11-15",4.0,"Bottled.  Poured clear, deep ruddy brown with a short cap of beige/light brown headage.  The aroma was quite delightful.. soft and calculated smoked meaty malts, well-roasted dark chocolate, other black malts, and brown sugar all blended together seamlessly.. I like how the smoke is a player, but doesnt mask the roasty dark malts.  The flavor had a dry-roasted, medium-bodied, chocolate and coffee-based porter at the core, with light coffee bitterness and the same sweeter smoked malts and woodiness surrounding (some smoked malts wash over the deeper-rooted chocolate and some darker fruity malts especially at the back-end)... sweet overall with nice roast and smoky accents.  Light-medium bodied and dry on the palate with lower carbonation.. well-balanced.. sweet, smoky finish.  This was mighty tasty!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3079,"2007-11-15",3.9,"12oz, no date, though I think it was bottled within the last week.  Deep deep ruby with a one finger tan head, fades to a creamy film.  Didnt have a hard time finding the smoke at all, though it isnt as smoky as Schlenkerla.  Roasted malts--not like coffee in this case--and some fruity notes (I cant put my finger on it) are up front.  Theres also some light spice and soft notes of brown sugar.  Flavor adds a little more smoke clear to the ashy, roasty dry finish (bitterness peaks at a 3).  Backing up a bit, flavor has plenty of roast with the acidic tang I pick up in most porters/stouts.  Also some milk chocolate notes.  Smooth low to moderate carbonation with a light to medium body--I echo that its just a tad thin.  Very good stuff!","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
3079,"2007-11-13",4.1,"Pours a very dark brown/black with dark red when tilted to the light. Head is a light tan color that retains well and leaves some nice lacing. Smell is roasty, with some smokiness (though not much) and has hints of sweet cherries. Taste is roasty right at the start, leading into a little bit of sweetness from lactose followed by a lighter fruitiness (pear-like?) and of course has a lingering smoky finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body and on the lower side of carbonation. Good beer, Ill have to try it again in something other than a pint glass.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"
3079,"2007-11-13",4.4,"Dark color.  Smell of roasted coffee, malt, chocolate frosting, minor smoke, caramel and burning leaves.  Taste of malt, dark chocolate, light brown sugar, hops, roasted coffee and light smoke flavor.  Very smooth and goes down very nice.  Wonderful smoked porter.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
3079,"2007-11-10",3.9,"Oakey,grain malt aromakissed by the delectable scent of Beechwood loved German malt,taste is a wonderful combination of coffees choclate fudge,and subtle roastedness,all tenderly laced with the hint of smoke leaving a slight coffee and smoke taste on the tongue,mouthfeel is light medium,and you start losing the smoke in the middle of the glass,its a really good porter from Mr. Carey,just a touch thin to be considered classic","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
3079,"2007-11-09",4.4,"Very dark brown color with a thin, stable lid of dark beige bubbles. Light aromas of smoke enveloped by dark chocolate, roasted malts and pale malts. A smooth subtle scent that just begs for a smoke sausage, grilled meats or a peasant feast. Very smooth and creamy feel. This feels like a perfect cask ale, smooth with a small bubbles gliding the liquid across the tongue. Starts out quite dry with roasted malts. Middle is full of dark caramel, full malt sweetness and a touch of herbal hops. Linger is solid with the full malt spectrum, from pale to roasted, with toasted in between. While I wouldnt mind a touch more smoke, this is another great brew from New Glarus.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
