Loads of funky grape juice! (Pardon my dumbing down here...) This was about as close to wine as beer can get! Loads and loads of oaky, vinous notes.

4429,"2017-05-07",3.9,"From Toer de Geuze 2017 >> Clairement plus une bière fruitée quune bière au vin. Le fruité du Pinot impose franchement son cachet à cette gueuze au nez et à lattaque; lacidité arrivant en arrière bouche pour soutenir la dégustation et lui donner une certaine vigueur avec beaucoup déquilibre. Point de caractère vineux dans celle-là, mais des saveurs de barriques plus ou moins complexes, et agréables, en fin de compte, qui font la signature de Tilquin. Donc assez douce mais sans sucrosité.","Braine, BELGIUM","poech73"
4429,"2017-05-07",4.0,"Pours entirely flat, has a dark orange-reddish color.

Smell is defined by old oak, sweet grapes which contrast beautifully the sublime tartness, lingering underneath, building the foundation in this, together with a wet cellar quality. 

Has practically no carbonation but drinks very nice nontheless, due ro a velvet mouthfeel, paired with a well nuanced sour refreshment. 

Tastes of a musty tartness, which compliments to lighter, sweet grapes, featuring a stone pit note, mingling into blue cheese. Turns even fruitier during mid palate, developing a bright lemon sourness, together with a tongue tingling dryness. Finishes wooden, dusty, moldy, yummy - with lots of ripe grapes mingle into lemon zest.

Very well nuanced grape lambic, flawless, with an intriguing depth, showcasing the pinot noir in a very compelling way.","GERMANY","aleigator"

4429,"2017-02-19",4.1,"Évolution claire de ce Pinot entre il y a qcq mois et maintenant, le fruité saffirme un peu plus tout en notant que leffervescence ressentie habituellement demeure un peu en demi teinte.
De couleur acajou sur léger voile, le col est modeste virant sur un léger rosâtre qui retombe rapidement.
Arôme offre une profondeur de fruité de cépage avec en rétro un léger funk caractéristique des lambics. Petite touche de boisé, fleuri avec une impression de léger souffre et effluve tannique.
Palais offre un agréable fruité du pinot avec une effervescence qui semble avoir repris une place plus intéressante sans pour autant rivaliser avec celle des autres produits Tilquin. Sur un essai plus ancien, le Pinot ressort davantage offrant un aspect fruité pulpeux complété par de fines notes de tanins.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

4429,"2016-12-20",4.8,"Tilquins new grape lambic, from a 75 cl bottle at Moeder Lambic Original, the tenth anniversary of which is the immediate cause of this beers existence. Very regularly shaped, creamy, dense, pale greyish beige, moussy head over a downright stunning looking, equally misty, very deep and warm sunset amber beer with copper red hue - I could not stop gazing at it. Aroma is fantastic, complex lambic funk with a ton of fresh fruit drenched into it: overripe blue plums - or indeed Pinot Noir grapes, stale sweat, fruit yoghurt, tomato concentrate, redcurrant, grape peel and toasty grape seeds - even grape seed oil gaining strenght as it warms up, lemon juice, moist wood, red wine or sherry vinegar, stewed raspberries... Intensely fruity onset, a wave of both the actual grapes with a deeply situated sweet core surrounded by wryness also coming from the classic lambic properties of unripe plum, redcurrant and lemon, acidic but not overly puckering, finely tingling, lambrusco-like carbonation, smooth mouthfeel with a bready undertone. This breadiness is gradually accentuated by not only yeast aspects as consumption of the bottle progresses, but also by a biscuity, toasty grape peel flavor manifesting itself in the finish, amidst a wealth of drying lactic tartness, bone dry vinegary acidity, some woody tannins - and, finally, a redeeming grape juice sweetish touch. This is a lambic of utmost beauty and complexity - and therefore automatically a world class beer. I am glad I tasted this masterpiece, hopefully more and bigger batches of it will follow in the future. Kudos to Pierre Tilquin, once again.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
