493,"2013-03-28",3.9,"Oily black pour and in a similarly thick indent on the glass with swirl - but no head pops up at any stage. Warming walnutiness without any firm notion of the 21 years of booze previously inhabiting the barrell the blend aged in.
Very smooth sumptous cocoa and slight metallic underlay, perhaps a subtle nod of whisky creeping in only to be swept up with dry roasted welts of soily cinnamon. 
The palate impressively thin, super soft carb but not too thin. Lacks a lot of creaminess that I think could really help whispers of fudge and peach sweetness. The linger is where the whisky truly reveals itself in a fade-to-black boozy burn and grainy dryness. Pings of ginger and lesser aniseed before the finish slopes off. Much less intense a savouring than I expected and hoped for - would love to know if this has been aged for more than a month, if even close to 90 days.

Overall this was a real treat to pick up, having not attended either MTB event. However Id just come from the Black Isle (9 months aged Hibernator!) so it had a lot to stack up against. I hope to be confirmed or corrected but the stouts were the Imperial Export and Imperial Brown. This is really excellent, but leaves too much room for an impact youd normally associate from The Kernel, even if ageing isnt their cup of tea just yet - I hope theres more to come.
