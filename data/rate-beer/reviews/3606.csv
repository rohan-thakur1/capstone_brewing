Looks: Cloudy hazy amber honey colour with small lumps of yeast particles; Less than one-quarter finger head with soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Good sticky lacing and zero carbonation.</p[>

Aroma: Fairly fragrant and sweet Ale malt, with light pineapples, shades of passion fruits, floral, light honey, sugar and light bread.

Taste: Mid to light sweet light Ale malt, with fair grapefruits, light floral, light caramel, molasses, resins, light biscuits, yeast, lemon, moderate bitter hops and grass.

Body: Close to light body. Thin and quite oozy palate. 

Mouth Feel: Fair to light Ale maltyness in a watery background. Strong American hops stole the show with fair grapefruits, floral and strong resin ooze. Fair sweetness, biscuity and yeasty with strong lemon to round. Pretty good!

Hoppiness: Pineapples, light passion fruits, floral and light honey in nose. Grapefruit, light floral, strong resins, lemon and grass in taste. Bitterness is moderately strong for a lasting, mid to high astringent floral finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Oozy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: Maybe being clocked at low abv plus wheat-thinned, this one is restrained as a light pale Ale, a bit too watery. That said, it has strong fruity hop aroma and pound-for-pound oozy citrusy hoppy taste. A very solid light Bitter. Recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Throwing the bottle down the stairs wouldnÂ’t have produced more head. Excellent aroma - super fresh and stiff citrus kicked my attention up. Sweet peaches, sweet grapefruit, nectarine, floral, very nice caramel. Not overly complex but who cares - this just smells very good. Powdery orange as well. The taste is, well, tasty but nothing as goo as the aroma. Plenty of citrus and hops, no doubt about that, apple, hard and long bitterness that I canÂ’t get out of my mouth... I can fix that by drinking more. Caramel, light bready things, rand out of beer.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

3606,"2011-06-09",3.3,"My Bottom Line:
This BitterÂ’s pleasant leafy and citrusy hop resins evolve in a soft, lush body, but this bottleÂ’s aroma was really not an attractive prelude to the flavor profile.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the hazy honeyed gold.
-A rubbery, phenolic touch in the nose marred most of the experience for me.
-The bright second half of each sip benefits from a citrusy hop comeback.
-The hop aroma is faint compared to the finishing bitterness. Either this bottle is not fresh (quite possible) or the aroma doesnÂ’t appropriately announce what is to come. 
-Malts provide sustenance in the form of light toast and caramel, but hops tend to take over here. I wish I had tried this from a cask first...
