Straight from the brewshop courtesy of my brother. Pours jet black with a gorgeous dense brown head. Aroma is a punch in the face of hops, citrusy, slightly piney, and a very slight hint of roasted malt. The taste is also heavily skewed towards the hoppy spectrum with a massive assault on the tongue of the same citrus and pine hops in the aroma. You have to like hops to like this beer, and thankfully, I LOVE hops. The aftertaste is nice and rich malt to balance it out, the beer feels almost creamy in the mouth, and leaves you wanting more.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","yarry"

3989,"2013-04-18",4.2,"On tap @ Imbibe  this is a dark brown-black ale with a 3 finger puffy off white cap that has a viscous mouth feel.

The flavour has big roasty-toasty malts assault the palate, hops balance with a resinous piney flare  complexity mid palate with some Spearmint, smoke, citrus peel, tobacco, roast walnut  then it goes to a rich viscous roasty-piney finish.  
Every once in a while a local crafter produces a unique twist on a style that just lights up your palate  Malevolent is that type of brew.
