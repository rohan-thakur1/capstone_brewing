2011,"2017-06-07",3.7,"Pours a very dark brown with a huge frothy tan khaki head that leaves a lot of lacing. The aromas were a little lacking but consisted of caramel and roasted malt. Flavors are made of nuts, coffee, caramel and some milk. A creamy and fairly light body with a bitter and dry finish. This was more sweet stout-like than it was brown ale but delicious nonetheless.","West Virginia, USA","WVHouseofBeer"

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, chocolate, nuts, mocha, roasted malts and coffee.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque ruby/dark brown beer with heavy yeast and with a medium beige head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, chocolate, nuts and mocha; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts and coffee.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Amazing idea to bring lactose and coffee? together in a Brown Ale. Great appearance, flavour and palate; but the aroma could have been stronger. All those hops are definitely needed, but are never distinctly noticeable.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Robust coffee bean aroma with sweet and roasted malts balancing each other out. Roasted espresso/coffee bean along with dark chocolate and lactic sugar. Its nice to come across a coffee beer that doesnt smell like a week old used coffee filter. Some caramel, toffee and lighter chocolate balancing out the roast. 

Medium bodied with tight carbonation and a stronger roast presence than the aroma suggests. Lots of dry, roasted coffee bean flavor but it never becomes acrid or overbearing. Espresso like flavor with chocolate/mocha sweetness along with toast, toffee and oatmeal. Some lactic sugar sweetness but not as much as expected. Could use a bit more of that, in my opinion, to balance things out. Overall, this beer is decently balanced and easy to drink with nice coffee flavor but I didnt find anything that elevates it above an average coffee beer.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Nose has rich toasty malts, light coffee, and maybe some toffee sweetness. The body is full, but not super thick. On the drier side. The taste is great. Starts off with a sweet toffee front followed by chocolate and then delicious roasty coffee notes. It ends with a flavor of burnt malts, and while Im normally not a fan of burnt-tasting beers, I cant stop drinking this one. One of the best incorporations of well-roasted malts Ive yet consumed.

2011,"2012-08-28",3.8,"The pour is a very dark brown with a moderately full, pale tan, fluffy, pillowy head which is somewhat lasting and leaves thick soapy lace.  The nose is pleasant with lots of nutty notes (roasted almonds, hazelnut), roasty but with restraint, a sharp grapefruit hop note, milk chocolate, buttered dark toast, maybe a light chocolate ice cream note.  The flavor is similar with plenty of resinous and sharp grapefruit which somehow is complementary to the coffee and chocolate notes, milk chocolate, earthy coffee roast, burnt toast, some peppery spice, and roasted almonds.  The palate is medium to full, silky, creamy, and nearly lively.  The finish is still very nutty, a hefty acidity from coffee and citrus alike, some spicy resins, and burnt toast.  The hop choices were evident with the resin and intense citrus notes but surprisingly did not contrast with the coffee and chocolate notes.  The acidity did become slightly overbearing by the finish but that is usually pretty standard for coffee beers.  I do not really see this a substitute from mocha coffee drink but it is interesting to see the coffee and hop notes meld well together.

Brune légère, col fin beige.
Arôme me paraît plus houblonné laissant des notes de citron surtout quand la mousse reste présente, note de café en retrait avec une pointe de chocolat.
En bouche, aspect plus black IPA avec une belle note de houblons citronné rajoutant une fine amertume. Le tout est sec et pétillant avec un café amer laissant un fin picotement et rappelant ce café un peu froid. Le café reste en deçà de ce que jattendais, moyennement grillé et torréfié avec au final un houblon qui domine.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Pours hazy dark red color with a frothy head, leaves a nice lacing behind. Aroma of chocolate malts, mild dark berry notes, fairly strong coffee, caramel and a hint of nuts.
