1586,"2015-04-20",3.1,"Bottle picked up on a whim at Whole Foods for $7. 04/20/2015. Pours cloudy white, like skim milk. Aroma is banana, subtle canned pineapple, touch of vanilla with creamy rice milk. Taste is creamy banana and sweet coconut, light yogurt with warming finish. Light medium body. A little rough and muted, but not bad for something at this price and easily available.","New York, USA","jbeatty"
1586,"2015-04-03",3.4,"Bottle. Banana aroma with hint of licorice. Cloudy white color. Slight banana flavor upfront with subtle pineapple note. Mouthfeel is a smooth and creamy but a little thin. Warming alcohol in the finish with licorice notes.

1586,"2011-10-16",3.9,"375 mL bottle.  Pours a clouded white like coconut milk.  Sweet sugary banana frosting aroma.  Palate is ever so slightly grainy.  Flavor is sweet, sugary vanilla frosting, fruity banana elements, almond, cotton candy, brown sugar, and more sugary descriptors.  A little alcohol creeps into the finish.  This is easy to drink and quite flavorful with no harsh edges.  I really like it.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
1586,"2011-06-15",3.2,"Thanks turd for sharing. Pours a cloudy milk white. Nose is interesting, has a rich almost dessert-ish quality with notes of spicy alcohol and cream cheese icing. Full bodied with a mild sweetness.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
1586,"2011-06-09",2.9,"Bottle I bought at Whole Foods last summer.  Cloudy unattractive milky white.   . Nose of vinegar, sherry, coconut, banana, toffee. Flavor has more coconut, almond, sherry, big alcohol burn, lightly astringent.  Meh.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
1586,"2011-05-01",3.2,"Bottle.  Pours lightly cloudy and milky white.  Some rather small particulates cling to the glass.  Aroma is banana, coconut, and vanilla, and light rice.  Flavor is spicy and peppery alcohol with coconut, banana, and licorice.  Sweet with a moderate alcohol burn.  This one tempered the wasabi spice very nicely.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1586,"2009-10-16",3.2,"Bottle: Pours a lightly cloudy milky white with no legs; the particulates are small and unobtrusive. The nose is minerally and ripe with apple, grape and alcohol, some bright koji and rice notes as well. The flavor isnt as sweet as I was expecting, more of a creamy banana/coconut note with the alcohol and acidity to balance. The impact is light and the acidity is lightened by the sweetness. Fortunately. And the finish is easy and not too chewy. Nice nigori, Im not usually a fan, especially of nigori genshus.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1586,"2009-02-01",2.7,"375 mL bottle from Whole Foods Market, Charlottesville, VA. Pours a slightly viscous milky white color. Aroma of rice, banana, pineapple, mango. Taste is sweet... banana, vanilla and fairly strong ethanol. Medium bodied. This is a dessert sake, definitely.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
1586,"2009-01-09",2.9,"Labeled as Fudo Myoo Ginjo Nigori Genshu Sake....Shake Well. Sent in a picture to be uploaded. Pours a sort of milky yellow color that looks like something, as a man, I would refrain from...err..swallowing... Some film left on the glass. Strong aroma with paint thinner, banana, pineapple, alcohol and vanilla ice cream and a touch of pastis. Taste is alcohol, and strongly so. Note of banana cream and coconut as well. Very sweet and has a decent amount of koji and a bit of unami-ness in the finish. Okay for the price but not repeatable.

Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, as well as very hot. Seems like just a poorly made, low balance, high alcohol Nigori.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1586,"2008-04-15",3.9,"Aroma is ricey with banana and slightly yeasty.  It has a creamy texture with some noticeable sediment - but not unpleasantly so.  The taste is sweat with a strong rice flavor with more subtle hints of coconut and maybe some mango.  There is a slight alcohol burn at the end.

As a side note - I have had a couple of different 375ml bottles bought from whole foods in Chicago.  There seems to be quite a bit of variation in the taste of this sake since some bottles seemed sweeter or fruiter than others.  Certainly not the most consistent Sake, but still one I enjoy regularly.","Illinois, USA","Kailunkat"
1586,"2008-03-25",2.8,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2010 The aroma is sweet with both rice and alcohol. The appearance is cloudy white. The flavor is like the aroma with a touch of coconut. The palate is thick for a sake. Overall I am satisfied that this is an above average sake.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1586,"2008-03-25",2.9,"Quite good in its over all style. The sake is very sweet and its taste is chunky, with a slight tangy sensation. straight forward and tasty at its core.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1586,"2008-01-11",3.5,"Bottle. Pours milky white with some flecks of sediment visible. Mild aroma has vanilla, coconut and rice. Also some   damp yeast aroma. Flavor has mildly sweet vanilla underlying everything, with a hint of spices and with some alcohol bite in the cheeks. Some floral and citrus notes, as well. Sweetness lingers in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and textured.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"
1586,"2008-01-05",3.5,"Bottle purchased at Whole Foods, Charlottesville, VA. Pours cloudy, chunky white. Alcohol in the nose, with coconut and some tartness. Fruit, alcohol, and coconut in the mouth. Tasty.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
1586,"2007-11-27",3.4,"Chilled bottle from Whole Foods, Sarasota, FL. Poured cloudy white pour with sticky legs. Moderate coconut and melons aroma. Medium body with a creamy texture. Medium tart fruit and rice flavor with a medium sweet finish with a warming burn of moderate duration. My expectations were met.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1586,"2007-08-04",3.0,"Atlanta, Ga. - Briarcliff Whole Foods - 375 screw top bottle - served chilled. Slightly darker than a clear pour - has some glint to it.  Fresh, coconut-like aroma. Flavor has a definite pleasant alcohol burn to it. Some boiled rice, some coconut. a hint of vanilla. Very clena tasting and refined. Clean, even mouthfeel.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
1586,"2007-04-21",3.7,"375ml bottle: Pours to a completely opaque, cloudy white with some dirty yellow tints and no head.  The aroma is honeydew melon rind, mild vanilla bean, light chocolate, banana, pineapple or mild citrus, alcohol, a combination of light yeast & wonderbread, and a very mild hint of black pepper.  The taste is mild rice & flower at first, its actually surprising how mild it is as it hits the tongue.  However this quickly explodes into rose petals (without the bitterness), alcohol, mild coconut, buttery almonds, cocoa bean, soy milk, mild vanilla, white chocolate.  Medium-full bodied for a sake, thick & silky in the mouth, the alcohol is high but the mouthfeel is very comforting and smooth.  Finishes with some alcohol-honeydew-peach-vanilla-white chocolate flavors.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
