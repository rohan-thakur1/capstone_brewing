285,"2017-06-12",4.6,"I had two bottles of Pliny at Wades Wines Tasting Room in Spring 2017, and loved it. This is a flagship West Coast IPA, and stands up to it's reputation. Although local breweries are producing Doubles as good, if not better, I wouldn't turn it down. Strong and smooth, but with some bitterness I could do without.

285,"2017-05-23",3.5,"510ml bottle - thanks Helen proximally, and random visitor from S.F. ultimately!
Bottled 29 days ago, thats one of the freshest US hop-oriented beers Ive ever had. Pale gold, crystal clear, brief loose head. Pretty fruity hops, but some sweaty stankiness too, and a promise of bitterness. Once the chills off, some caramel appears too. Light palate, crisp carbonaton, but not lacking fullness. Oooooh, thats a very pleasing taste - very citrussy/lemony hop forward, would not be surprised to see citra several times in the hop schedule - but with a very pleasant balance and drinkability to it. Like the bitter bite, makes my teeth slighty metallic. Light malts gently support the hops, but play second fiddle. Strange for a hop-forward beer to be better in the taste than the aroma, but Im very happy its so. Finish gets more bitter, more herbal, and even with a bit of seared pork fat in it, which I particularly like. Really picked up after the aroma.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
285,"2017-05-22",2.9,"I recently bought 2 bottles from April 2017 production and tried them on two separate occasions. In short, this IPA is OK but I wasnt impressed and felt underwhelmed with all of the hype about it. The best part is its fragrance - very floral. Taste is like a common IPA with plenty of hop flavor, fairly bitter, and light/watery mouthfeel. Didnt really detect any creaminess. Probably its better on tap and would be curious to try it but I wont be making the effort to find this in bottle again anytime soon.","","djnorth"

285,"2017-04-16",4.3,"(On tap @ Toronado SD, April 3/17) Pours a clear medium gold with an average white head and lace. Aroma is longer on resinous herbal and conifer notes than many modern IPAs, like pine and fir, grapefruit and citrus oils, lemongrass, some sweet orange and light tropical fruit notes, a hint of pretty clean and lightly sweet malt poking through the resin. Flavour again showcases lots of pretty hefty but flavourful hop resins, more pine needles, herbs, grapefruit peels, sweet orange, grass, lightly sweet and clean but definitely present pale malt backbone. Fairly high resinous bitterness, not totally palate scouring but quite a grip in the finish. Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly slick. A really nice balance for a bitter resinous style of DIPA. Its not a million times better than other good examples, but it is definitely very good.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

285,"2017-04-02",4.8,"What can be said that hasnt been said already about Pliny. Its a legendary IPA, and for good reason. Its appearance and aroma are beautiful, goldish orange, with a hoppy pine scent. The taste is awesome, smooth and malty, slightly sweet, notes of caramel and just an all around treat for the taste buds. As a stout lover, I appreciate this IPA not just for what it brings to my mouth, but what it doesnt bring too. Its hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so, and a bit more malt flavor than most Imperials. Keep Pliny cold, and drink it fresh. From a bottle, consumed within 24 hours of purchase. All around excellent, masterfully crafted (and marketed too) IPA.","California, USA","kevinator63"

285,"2017-03-24",4.4,"De Russian River(USA) esta Double IPA de nombre Pliny the Elder, la productora de este mito cervecero es originaria de Santa Rosa California, se tienen como los creadores de la ahora muy popular American IPA y de este estilo, durante mucho tiempo esta cerveza fue considerada la mejor Double IPA del planeta por su buen balance entre malta y lúpulo, tambien era el estandarte de la costa este, La cerveza Pliny the Elder (Plinio el Viejo) recibe su nombre en honor al viajero, naturalista, historiador, escritor y director romano Gaius Minor Plinius Caecilius Secundus, a quien se adjudica el haber dado el primer nombre botánico para el lúpulo: Salictarius Lupus, que significa lobo entre los matorrales un nombre muy apropiado al crecimiento salvaje que el lúpulo desarrollaba entre los sauces, con un nombre legendario y una fama envidiable dentro del ámbito cervecero, veamos que nos espera.
En apariencia es una cerveza con buena corona de espuma de tamaño mediano, muy clara, perlas de compactas a medianas, buena retención, bien la adherencia en el vaso, color dorado muy claro con destellos amarillos, ligeramente turbia, cuerpo medio, muy agradable en vista.
En aroma es realmente única tiene notas pináceas, florales y cítricas a toronja, cascara de naranja, ligera nota a guayaba, hay un toque de dulzor restringido seguramente propiciado por las maltas, la intensidad es mucha, en cuanto estilos IPA, IIPA y otros en donde los lúpulos son el ingrediente estrella se debe procurar tomar la cerveza lo mas fresco posible puesto que después de los primeros tres meses las propiedades del aroma y amargor de este ingrediente comienzan a degradarse.
En el paladar es muy equilibrada el amargor esta bien presente pero no es tan agresivo y se nivela con la malta y el dulzor que otorga, los sabores que se pueden identificar son pináceos y florales, resina vegetal, cítrica como toronja y cascara de naranja, guayaba, ligero toque a miel, en cuanto a textura porta cuerpo medio muy sedoso, deja una capa sobre las mejillas similar a el aceite muy posiblemente sea propiedad del Dry Hopping, una cerveza que sin lugar a duda ya no es la mejor IIPA del planeta aun asi su receta no a envejecido y tiene propiedades muy particulares que no e encontrado en otras cervezas del mismo estilo ademas su nombre forma parte de la mitología cervecera, sin duda un clásico que se tiene que probar por lo menos una vez en la vida si te interesa la cerveza de verdad, yo espero volvérmela a encontrar igual o aun mas fresca, esta botella que llego a mis manos fue envasada el 23/11/2016 y la ingerí el 14 de febrero de este año.","MEXICO","Yased"

Its aroma was dominated by fresh citrus and pine scents, featuring light grapefruit and perhaps watermelon, with touches of lemon, straw, and a bit of barley. The taste was a strong bitter blend of different citrus flavors along with an influx of pine and spices and slight touches of watermelon and grapefruit. There was also a very subtle malt character, lending just a touch of caramel and sweetness.

Right up to the lip of the snifter, chives and a gloriously obnoxious Columbus hop layer become overly apparent on the nose. This introduction is followed hesitantly by honeydew melon, paper pulp, dried jasmine, white tea, pine cones, saturated cardboard, apple cores, and stale crumpets.  I took a sip, and gulped it down - I experienced the same flavors, but bitter & Valencia orange peels, lavender, gym socks, and mint overwhelmed my tongues processing. A rebound peck carrying unripe kiwifruit, wildflowers, and marsh sage participated in my swallows examination.
 An exceptionally clean, delicious fill. I consider this to be a wonderful, enigmatic IPA, though I certainly became perplexed on its bitterness - which wasnt intense by any means, but pushed more of a ""hop vagueness"" in a way I didnt know how to respond to it.

Great hops combination on just the right amounts. Gold with Orangy tones and a white crown. Good retention. 

I was expecting a very bitter taste, but actually is not that intense. Dont get me wrong... it is bitter, but its not harsh. You can taste a little bit of malt sweetness, but youll be overwhelmed by the citrics fruits flavors (mostly grapefruit). This is not the place if your are looking for yeasty flavors. Youll get a strong bitterness on the after taste... lingering... dry but pleasant.

Light with regular carbonation. Very easy to drink, and very inviting, so watch out... its a 8%.

Finally got the chance to have a Pliny, I was wondering if it could justify the hype, after all its a double ipa, a style there is released about one zillion new brews of each day. This is supposed to be one of the kings on the hill. The fruity hop aroma works well with the crisp malt. Fruitness is dominating with strong tropical notes, flowers, resin. Taste has a nod of sweet malt, mostly hop driven as well. Bitterness comes through easily, making a dry and crisp yet fruity beer. Little to suggest this is a strong double as the malt and sweetness is hidden away behind the hops here. Zesty and full of resin I conclude the hype is more or less justified.","NORWAY","daje"

285,"2016-02-13",3.7,"Thanks Rob for this very brew Ive been waiting for so long to try! Dégustée en apéro en revenant du spa. Je me sens privilégié, ma spatule de risotto aux queues de homards à la main, de déguster une fraîche représentante de la mère de Heady et de presque toutes les IIPA que nous connaissons aujourdhui. Pliny était effectivement bien en avance sur notre époque. Liquide très doré, presque cristallin et bien mousseux. Jai les deux pieds dans locéan de la côte ouest avec une forêt de conifères pour seul témoin. De la résine et beaucoup de fruits. Je sens que ce liquide au corps visible ne se laissera pas boire sans mot dire. En effet, le liquide est collant en bouche et présente des notes organiques de pain au levain. Lamertume nest pas tranchante mais provient dun zeste dagrumes qui se mêle parfaitement au pin. Texture beurrée, rondeur appréciable et alcool tout-à-fait imperceptible. Je ne peine aucunement à imaginer que cette bière fut à lépoque, une réelle révélation!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
285,"2016-02-13",4.4,"510ml bottle. 1/25/16 bottle date (19 days old). Appearance: crystal clear golden orange, with a thick slightly off white head. Nice lacing. 
Aroma: Strong fresh fruity melon and citrus, with a bit of pine. 
Taste: Light malt sweetness with a touch of caramel, turning to a strong, juicy, grassy, resinous hop flavor. Only the lightest touch of citrus comes across. Bitterness slowly builds into strong crescendo. 
Mouthfeel: Light body for the style with a moderately high carbonation. 
Finish: Very dry with a strong grassy bitterness. 
Overall: Probably the easiest drinking, most refreshing IIPA youll find. Lighter malt base than most but still balances the strong bitterness well.","","TH28"

285,"2016-01-29",4.9,"What separates this imperial IPA from all others is its cohesion and secondary attributes. In a world where most IPAs are designed to explode your face upon first sip, the Pliny is a lesson in what a properly balanced imperial IPA should drink like. No discernible flaws. Not too much or too little of anything. Its an IPA that is shockingly smooth by any standard with a crisp, clean finish. 100 IBU beer without a trace of bitterness. Magical how well integrated this beer is.","","David_Deas"

285,"2016-01-18",4.7,"Worth the hype. Much more subdued than the deScription implies (40% more malt and twice the hops). In the hands of an amateur that would translate to ""thick, sweet sticky cat piss"", but that's not what has happened here. The aroma is so pleasant- Pine, wild flowers and citrus. The flavor is big, but not malty. Light, bright and a little spicy. The finish is what gets me. Just like that, it's gone. No lingering hop resin or hairy tongue like some cheap ironically over hopped bullshit hipster IPA.

I find myself in a pine hewn cabin deep in a wood, prostrate on a woven wool rug while the hops grow into the walls and eventually consume my being. And suddenly the vision is adrift.

The bar owner Rudy had been given two bottles of this and kept one for the exchange evening. He knew I wanted to try it, so early on in the evening he palmed me the bottle for drinking later. At midnight with only about six people left I broached the bottle and we all had a decent sized sample. 
Poured a golden amber with a weak white head. Aroma was citrusy hops and semi-sweet malts: mild tropical fruitiness hints also. The taste was more malty than the nose intimated with a biscuit like flavour, tempered with a fruity backbone.

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  Pours a clear golden color with a two finger nearly pure white head. The head has a fair level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a very nice level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heavy of a citrus aroma being both sweet and hoppy at the same time. The sweet citrus is of tangerine and orange while the hoppy is of grapefruit. Mixed with these smells is a bready aroma as well as a bit of caramel and some pine hop smells. Overall the aroma is citrusy, but yet still maintains a nice balance.

 Taste  The taste begins with a smooth bready and sweeter taste with the sweetness being of a caramel, tropical and citrus fruit flavors of orange and tangerine. With these flavors so too comes some grapefruit hop upfront, which starts out at a moderate strength and grows stronger to the end. Along with the grapefruit increasing some pine hop flavors also come to the tongue while the caramel flavors, that were initially present begin fading. In the end with the hop increasing and the sweet decreasing a nice crisp and mainly citrusy hop flavor to be left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a nice smoothness throughout. The carbonation is on the slightly lower side which when combined with the creamier body of the brew and the nice balanced sweet and hoppy taste overall create a very easy drinking feel. 

 Overall  A very tasty IPA no doubt, but not as amazing and overshadowing of other IPA of its strength and class as many make it seem, which is likely driven by limited availability/distribution. It is certainly well worth a try though if you get a chance.","","Darkmagus82"

285,"2014-08-31",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2016 The archetypical double IPA, the follow-up to Blind Pigs version which is still kept alive by Russian River as a tribute to Vinnie Cilurzo, the man who started this young beer style at the end of the previous millennium.  Tasted this almost ten years ago when my palate wasnt as experienced as it is now so I was looking forward to re-rate a fresh bottle, generously shared by Jan yesterday.  Lightly lacing, moussy, off-white, stable head over a clear, warm old gold coloured beer with orangey hue and vivid sparkling - remaining clear even with the last drop added, so apparently this has been filtered, contrary to e.g. Heady Topper, that other DIPA superstar.  Aroma of green tea and even green tea-coloured noodles, yellow grapefruit, toasted onion, green olive, dry cookies, marihuana, unripe mango, green banana peel, pineapple, biscuit, bitter orange - in all: dank alright, but fairly restrained in comparison with many younger DIPAs.  Clean malty fruitiness in the onset, hints of unripe green kiwi, raw pineapple, green banana and a hint of yellow passion fruit with a slight green olive-like umami touch; softish carbo, supple and resinous yet full mouthfeel.  Lightly biscuity malt base with a subtle nutty edge is mixed beautifully with a long, resinous, spicy hop bitter finish yielding lovely grapefruit, pine, pepper and toasted onion aromas retronasally.  Long lasting bitterness as is to be expected from the style, but nothing too harsh.  This is a DIPA which excels in elegance and restraint - yet at the same time remains very generous.  I like a fresh Heady Topper even more if a comparison must be made, but this is surely a top notch example made with utmost care and passion.  Incontournable, as the French say.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Taste is absolutely incredible. Most IPAs and DIPAs dont quite get that balance right. Most have that little bit of astringent bitterness that makes you pucker a little. Pliny nails it. This is not a ""hop bomb"". It is an exquisitely crafted, perfectly balanced DIPA. Pliny compels you to keep drinking it. The mouthfeel is medium, not too thin, not too thick. The finish is outstanding. It is INSANELY, deceivingly drinkable. A lot of people claim that this beer is overhyped, but to me, this is the gold standard by which all DIPAs should be measured. Ive had it twice, and both times I finished the beer in about 10 minutes. It literally made my mouth water and I couldnt stop myself from taking sip after sip.","Lubbock, Texas, USA","chiiidog"

This brew does have a subtle amount of pale malts but this is secondary to the array of hops. Grapefruit peel, light grass effects, with the floral hitting near the back side. Of course it is not just floral in the finish, lots of pine there as well to round off the myriad of hop flavors.

This is how it is to be living on the edge. So, when I get a 15 month old Pliny the Elder, what do I do? Do I adhere to the orders given by the label: ""Consume fresh or not at all""? Oh no, not me, not this crazy bastard. I open the bottle, and I pour a glass of crystal clear, medium amber liquid, with a large, off-white head that is pretty short-lived, but the thin layer that is left is fully lasting, and here be laces. The aroma is strong and is heavy hoppy and moderate malty. Lots of overripe tropical fruits, the mango and peach are in place, also orange and orange marmalade. And to back up the hoppiness there is a wall of caramel malt. The flavour is also strong, the overripe tropical fruit basket still have contributions from the mango, but also pineapple and melon. Lots of sweet caramel, and orange marmalade and orange peel freshen things up. The taste is moderate sweet and the long finish is heavy bitter with resinous notes. Smooth and oily on the palate, mid-bodied with a soft carbonation. A wonderful beer! If this one really is that much better fresh, it must be utterly amazing!

285,"2014-05-22",4.3,"Bottle from Lothore, thank you very much Tyler! 

Pours a golden-amber hue, with a decent head, leaving a thin lacing. This beer smells wonderfull, as it is defined by intriguing aromas of grassy, fresh hops, along with oily pine, earthy malts and fruity papaya notes. As complex as the aromas are, the nose of this beer is very much hop centered, in a gentle, well balanced way - and I love it. As I had my first sample at the Cantillon Quintessence, I actually didnt want to drink the beer at the first moment, because I never had experienced such great aromas so far.

Almost dough, smooth beginning with oily, wooden flavors of pine, until the hops become recognizable. In an impressive way. They deliver a fantastic grassy bitterness which gets coated up by wooden malts and pleasant, warm oak. Hops define the taste of this beer, without washing away any of the supporting, complex flavors. This allows a multi-layered depth on the palate, which results in a long, dry aftertaste, as hops take over in the end. Citrus peel, kiwi and lime add crispy, fruity hints to the hop impression, altough they dont stand out too far on their own, but line up with the more present floral and herbal notes. The most pleasant thing about this Double-IPA is its perfect balance. While it is in fact very hoppy, nothing sticks out too much, nothing distracts from the unique complexity, very well done.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Strong citrus and pine aromas, juicy tropical fruits, bubblegum and honey like malts.
The flavour is so smooth and balanced, big juicy grapefruit and lemon zest, passion fruit and sultana. Razor sharp pine resins and honey on toast like malts. Amazing hop bitterness balances so well with the sweet malt backbone.
The finish is citrusy and bitter, leaves a nice sweet honey like coating which the bitterness just cuts through. An amazing example of an IPA.

The pour was very light, lighter than Amber almost like a wheat beer. 

The aroma, lots of hops, coffee ish flavors but nothing extra ordinary. 

The taste, this was the biggest disappointment of all. I did like the beer, don't get me wrong but I thought it was just a tad too monotonous. Maybe I've been waiting too long and the weight of the expectations is what crushed it for me. I personally love dogfish head 129 minutes. This beer felt like a lighter version of it, which is a-ok in my book.

Overall, in isolation I don't know if I would call it the best beer in the world(or the 2nd best) but it is a solid beer and delivered on the promise. I don't have any qualms about trying it and would happily spend the $10 for more over and over again.

Pour: no notes, drinking from the bottle. Considerable head and carbonation visible in bottle.

Aroma: fruity, pineapple, mango... Maybe some hops but not much relatively.

Taste: follows nose. Fruity, maybe a bit more like grapefruit in the mouth. Followed by and in good balance with hops and pine.

Mouthfeel is overall pretty light. Foamy, mild carbonation.

Overall: it's in the Bell's Hopslam neighborhood of Double/Imperial IPA; hoppy but balanced with fruitiness/citrus. To my taste, Hopslam seems more pineapple and honey notes, Pliny seems more grapefruit and mango-ish notes. It's a nice brew. I'd rate it higher, I'm just not a big IPA fan.

285,"2014-03-06",5.0,"American double / Imperial IPA 
8% ABV
100 IBU

APPEARANCE: Pours a bright, vibrant golden hue. Seems to glow or burn like fire dancing with orange highlights. Dense, billowy three fingers of head with great lacing. 

AROMA: Did I just snort a line of hops? In your face hops, intense pine and resin. Very dank and earthy that starts to give way to a fruit bomb of grapefruit, mango, papaya and citrus. End with light floral and grassy notes. 

TASTE: like tiny angels dancing on my tongue! First taste is that hoppy bitterness that takes over your mouth. Once you get used to it the layers of sweetness from the fruit really shine. Light lemon grass and floral hits with that great bitterness remaining throughout. 

MOUTHFEEL: Medium body with lively carbonation. Coats the entire mouth allowing the complex layers to really come out. Finished perfectly dry with nice lingering bitterness. 

OVERALL: This is the IPA I hold all others up against. For me and my pallet it's perfect. I 100% understand the hype behind this beer. From popping the bottle to the last sip out of my glass it never disappoints.

Aroma is green pine needles lightly spritzed with ruby grapefruit juice. Flavor is citrus with a subtle malt backbone. The balance in this is exquisite.

285,"2014-01-28",4.3,"(backlog ZBF 04/2013) Fresh bottle from the source kindly shared by BA-Mitch, unfairly competing with Camba Bavaria IPA. I believe the key ingredient in this DIPAs success is the balance it strikes between supporting pine bitterness, fairly light and crisp pale malts and a cornucopia of citrus (pink grapefruit) and whiffs of pineapple sitting on top of that. Drier than most juicy DIPAs of this calibre. Whilst West Coast C-hops in themselves by now have nothing left to prove, this beer has a lot to teach lesser US hopmonsters in terms of sheer modesty and restraint, the true seal of craftmanship, making this a paragon of its genre that could represent US DIPAs far more gracefully on this side of the Atlantic than some of the more readily available ones.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

A: Golden beer with an inch and a half of white head that settles to a foam.

S: Floral, piney, and citrusy, there is also an air of freshness to the nose of this beer.

M: The feel is crisp and clean. For a double ipa, this beer has a surprisingly light body to it.

T: The taste is citrusy, grapefruity, piney, hoppy, but not overtly hoppy. There is almost no bite on the back end, however you can slightly taste the alcohol, but not in an unappealing way. At first the hops overwhelm your senses, but after your sip you are left refreshed desiring to taste more.

O: This beer is incredible, and makes me ponder moving to into its distribution area, well maybe not entirely. This is my first time trying this beer thanks to a trade I made earlier this week. This beer is crisp and flavorful. The hops in this beer work so well together. Makes me glad I have another on the way next week!

285,"2013-12-23",4.3,"The beer pours an oranging yellow with amber highlights, kind of like a sunrise The beer forms a big, pillowy head of rocky white bubbles that are slightly off-white. The head lasts nicely, but does mellow down from its initial height to about a half-fingers width. As the head dissipates, it leaves a nice sticky patchwork of lacing on the glass. In body the beer is crystal clear and clean, but does present a slight haze from the malt. On the nose, the beer smells of citrus and spicy pine. Floral and herbal notes dance around the edges of the nose but big citrus tangerine and grapefruit are the primary players in the beer. The nose is not blowing me away, but is just a very solid example of a hoppy beer dank pine and a touch of sweet caramel can also be sensed in the smell. As a whole, the smell tends to remind a little of a fresh pineapple blended with pine. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly balanced. The bitters are big and coat the mouth, but there is a strong bready sweetness to add balance. Light stone fruit notes can be picked out in the hop character, as well. The finish sees the strongest bitter kick, which is a bit over powering and should feed any ones bitter cravings. Acidity in the beer is light but bright on the sides of the cheeks. Again, this beer tastes like a classic DIPA. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, candied citrus, expanding into fresh Florida oranges, with a touch of orange peel and rind. Grapefruit, pine needles, and pineapple dance in the back along with the malts superbly balanced sweet caramel bread, which helps to give the hops their candied quality. I wasnt that taken with this beer on the initial sip, but that was foolish of me. Pliny is a subtle beast, building simple complexity from its hops, and making each sip different. Soft boozy heat can be felt in the back of the throat, but that is just another part of the complexity of this beer. This flavor is one I could sip all night. In the mouth, Pliny feels surprisingly on the light side of medium in body, with a fluffy carbonation that pillows the tongue nicely. Mouthfeel is slick, and crisp, making the beer dangerously easy to drink. Slight astringency can be felt as the beer moves across the tongue leaving the mouth only softly tingling with bitters. Saliva does gently pool in the cheeks, but overall the mouth is left rather clean and ready for further sips. Overall, this beer is a whale worthy of whaling after. Beautiful complexity and subtly make this a beer I could drink several of, which is dangerous for its ABV bracket. Where many of the modern DIPAs slam you in the face with juicy hop character, Pliny is subtle and perfectly balanced. This will please the hop heads and even those that are skeptical to hops. My mother, a diehard stout fan, but pale and hoppy beer hater, actually loved this when I brought one over last night. My only complaint is that the nose is mild compared to some DIPAs, but to be fair to Pliny, its recipe was developed before the designers of those other DIPAs even knew they liked hops. Pliny the Elder is a pleasure to drink. I cant wait to get my hands on more Russian River beers.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

Aroma is huge and interesting - lots of citrus, grapefruit, spicy and floral hop notes, with equally prominent caramel and biscuit aromas, and a more bizarre but intriguing hint of marshmallow. Taste is the absolutely perfect blend of malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness, with a lightly spicy undertone and the vaguest of hints of seaside and salt.

285,"2013-11-01",4.7,"My second Pliny, but first since 2009 and first full review. This bottle is courtesy of Eduardo.
Pliny looks amazing. A perfect yellow/amber/pale orange color with half an inch of white bubbly head. It has fantastic lacing as well. Sticky globules that hang onto the sides of the tulip. Aroma is wonderful too. Very floral and sweet. I love the hop balance. Lots of orange scents, with maybe a touch of lemon zest. Very floral, reminds me of this tiny yellow flower that grows here in FL. It also has the faintest hint of pine, which I normally dont like, but seems to be done really well in this beer. But where this beer shines is really in the taste. It reminds me of Six Points Bengali Tiger. Well balanced, hoppy/sweet combo and delicious. Pliny somehow takes this all up a notch! Everything I get from the nose, is doubled on my tongue, and in the best of ways. There is also the slightest of biscuity flavor too. Mouthfeel is simple, bubbly, very lightly creamy, and the hops do not attack my taste buds. I love this about Pliny. Most IPAs will sting your tongue with the aggressive hops. Also, this beer hides the 8% ABV extremely well; not as well as Compass from ST, but very very well. It drinks like a great single IPA.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","mverity"

285,"2013-10-30",4.8,"FROM NOTES: July 1, 12
Poured into a RR pint glass at the Russian River Pub. Fairly amazing beer. Even with all of the hype, it did not disappoint. The epitome of what I like to call the California Hop-Nazi style. It is a quintessential DIPA. Lots of full hoppy, citrusy aroma and flavor. It had a big enough malt backbone to balance out the hop ridiculous character. It was crisp, dry, refreshing, and addictive. I had several on tap at Russian River while waiting for the 2012 Tour of California finish, including having to slam one in an effort to race over to the finish line. I do NOT recommend disrespecting this beer, or your stomach, by slamming it down. While I generally prefer beers with less hops, I was stunned at the balance of this hop-monster. You need to try it, the hype isnt just hype. Now the details: 
A: Big tropical notes with floral undertones. Sexy beer. 
A: Pours a golden color with a one finger head that left some nice carbonation after dissipating.
T: Sweet Baby Jesus! Great balance for a DIPA. Big hop flavor right off, but as it opens up, grapefruit notes appear that add another interesting dimension to the beer. Fantastic malt after taste which really helps make this beer taste great and sets it apart from other DIPAs. 
P: Modestly carbonated, very tasty and very drinkable. 
O: Not much more to be said than my opening about this beer, but clearly TOP 2 DIPA/IIPA Ive ever had. Its nice for something this hyped to actually live up to its reputation and following! Beg, borrow, steal, commit treason -- do what is necessary to try this beer!","New Jersey, USA","ClassyBeagle"

While there was no way this beer could live up to the hype, it's still an excellent beer in a conservative, yet timeless way. It doesn't reflect any of the modern trends in IPAs and focuses itself on being Supremely balanced. This beer could be used as the definition for an IPA.

285,"2013-10-13",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2013 Here is the thing. This was my first time having Pliny because I live in a state too far from any of RRs distribution zones, and when I visit CA the popularity and legend of this beer make it impossible to pick up at a liqour store or whole foods.That legend and hype thus preceded my first tasting of this beer and so my rating might reflect that disparity between legend and living reality. Also, maybe this wasnt the freshest pour, since I had it at a Denver bar during GABF.Appearance: all is beautiful here. Medium gold with creamy white head. Head dissipated fast in my glass, though. Aroma: grapefruit, subtle orange, piney hops. Taste: very well balanced bitter hops and sweet malts. Light grapefruit throughout and finishes clean on a spicy/piney hop note. Palate: medium to light bodied, somewhat slick, but a solid finish. My thoughts are this: Pliny became legend before more robust and flavorful DIPAs (ahem, Hopslam!) came along. I dont think it?d have its reputation if it had to, in its early days, go toe to toe with something like Hopslam. The balance in this is well played and demonstrates deft brewing skill. But the best beers push boundaries. If the IPA movement is analogous to the American frontier, then Pliny?s boundary is somewhere back by St Louis, and Hopslam is settling down in California.","Alabama, USA","Dr_MedievAle"

285,"2013-09-04",4.5,"Bottle. Last time I declined to rate this I assumed it would always be available locally. Oops. Aroma of pineapple wafts out before I even bring my nose to the glass. Citrus, grapefruit, pine, and a dose of light caramel. Clear amber pour, white head, irregular lacing. Tastes like the prototype for a great double ipa. Malt backbone is present, offering just the right amount of sweetness to allow the hops to shine, without being too sweet or too dry. Bitterness is assertive, with big beautiful pine and citrus presence. Full body, average carbonation, great slick texture without being syrupy or thick. Lasting bitter finish. Everything about this is just right. Overall: I can imagine a time years ago when there was nothing else out there like this. Now it seems like there are a lot of good breweries out there who can make a solid double ipa that comes close to this ideal. Some take it even further, some go the same distance with a slightly different profile, but most fall short. There's a reason that this is such a classic, highly-regarded beer. Really impressive. I'm almost glad I can't get this all the time, so I can appreciate this as a special treat.

285,"2013-08-29",5.0,"Pliny the Elder pours a pale amber, lighter than expected, with a white, fluffy head that dissipates quickly. Not much lacing but that may be more because of the shaker pint it was served in. Aroma is big and fruity, lots of grapefruit, pine, and lemon. Grapefruit and pineapple hit the front of the tongue. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel can best be described as smooth, medium-light bodied with light carbonation, drinks much easier than its 8% ABV. Overall, this is one of the smoothest, easiest drinking Imperial IPAs out there. Outstanding job Russian River.

285,"2013-08-29",3.9,"This pours a dark banana yellow, slight haze, golden honey color with a creamy soft white head that fell slowly and left really great lace. The nose took a while to fully realize itself. It had a light pineapple and a light pine. Pale malt and lightly breaddy. Hop resins even on the nose. Hop floral and a sweet honey with the malt. There was no alcohol on the nose but there was a nice deep round hop scent. 

Taste was silky and smooth. The malt is soft but firm and very well done. it had a lightness to the body and a sweet bread that never took center stage away from the tremendous hop qualities. Fruits were fleeting on the palate. The pineapple gave way to tart grapefruit, then a little apple and pear showed up to add crispness and a touch of sweetness. Right in the middle it became bone dry and chalky. It had the taste of astringency or of an aspirin you chewed by mistake. Bitter hops flourished and this was delightful. They had a tiny bit of oil to deposit them along the palate and reside finally at the back. Light pine and a touch of malt. The resins are also light and they do their job keeping all those flavors lingering for a nice full aftertaste of a substantial bitter and the sweetness of the fruits. There was an alcohol warmth at the back of the throat but nothing hard from it on the palate. 

This beer was great but in my opinion it did not live up to all the hype. It was rousing with a well done bitter, it had a malt that was one of the best I have seen but it lacked definition in the fruits. It couldnt have been prettier to look at. Not the best I have ever had but I am glad I tried it and would drink it again but I wont kill myself trying to get more. It was stronger then you might expect and I liked that.

Flavours of clean deep hops, resin, malt, toffee, grapefruit. Great, but much hoppier than I expected. Flavours were all first class, but the standout was its polish. Perhaps because of its fame I came to it expecting it to pack a punch, but was retrained rather than refined.

The finish is long and savory but not oppressive, sustaining the best aspects of the impressive hoppiness of this brew leaving one yearning for another sip. I am not a huge fan of IPA's, much preferring Stouts and Porters, but this beer is amazing. I rank it in the top ten of beers I have tasted. I am now lusting to try Pliny the Younger.

Edit - my original 2 tastings were from a tulip glass, it was much more pleasant from a standard pint glass. Second review from growler 2014.

The taste of sweet tropical fruits with peppery notes and grassy towards the end. The finish is excellent with a lingering flavor of hops that makes you want to take another sip. The balance of this beer is remarkable and the smoothness of the palate makes it extremely drinkable.

It is usually far better on tap though this bottle (6 weeks old) is still pretty darn good. Would have to review it again when had on tap.

285,"2013-05-11",4.6,"Aroma-Not to overwhelming like most DIPA's. the traditional pine scent comes out very clean

Appearance-Not a bright bold orange, but still a crisp orange brown reflection. Very pleasing to the eye.

Taste-Simple mouthwatering perfection. If I could put this in a CamelBak and drink a liter a day, I would. What sets PTE apart is how smooth but subtlety intense it is. It's a toss up b/w PTE and Hopslam as the best readily available/bottled DIPA on the planet. With that said, I have Headytopper and Dreadnaught coming in this week.

Palate-Like liquid velvet pine scented grapefruit. The 8% isn't even noticeable. My palate told me afterwards that he almost died from euphoria!

Tout est plaisant dans ce regard : la couleur orangée de sa robe, la ténacité de sa tête mousseuse et la dentelle qui décore mon verre.  Le premier nez nest pas totalement explosif.  Il faut attendre quelques secondes pour que le spectacle débute.  Je suis frappé par ces parfums profondément complexes et alléchants.  Il est si facile de se prendre dans cette toile tissée par les agrumes, les fruits du verger, les fruits tropicaux, les herbes, les fleurs et les conifères.  La première gorgée et les suivantes me confirment aussi que je suis devant une démonstration de beauté et déquilibre.  Tout est mis en place ici pour rendre mes papilles heureuses.  Je suis bouche bée devant cette merveilleuse stupeur houblonnée.  Autant de saveurs dans une si petite bouteille.  Jaime ce profil amérisant qui privilégie la finesse au détriment dune intensité mal contrôlée.  Je suis impressionné par la justesse de cette base maltée.  Je savoure chaque parcelle de caramel et de miel.  Cet amour fusionnel entre les céréales et les houblons est renversant.  En bouche, ce modèle presque idéal montre un corps sculpté comme une athlète accomplie.  Son pétillement, conçu pour mon palais, ne fait que prolonger le plaisir provoqué par les saveurs.  Sa texture légèrement huileuse confirme sa perfection.  La finale,  inspirée par la tropicalité et le gazon fraîchement coupé, est une ode véritable à la forêt de conifère du littoral pacifique là où le climat océanique est parfumé par la pruche de louest, le cèdre rouge de Californie, lépicéa de Brewer, le pin dOregon et les rhododendrons.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

I remember this being fruiter and more floral and soft in the nose, as recently as one year ago, but those batches were around mid-3 at the time. Ive become more sensitive to the grating resin quality of excessive, so this is something like having a taste-test of wood sealant at McGuckin.  the body is certainly better than most IPA or hop-forward beers on the market right now, and aroma-wise its a little better than most, but the flavor is pretty common.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Its like a watched pot that never boils. Ive never seen a head retain so well. You think youre taunting me beer? Well, guess what, Im reviewing you on BA, so Ive got time. In keeping with the theme of this weekend past, the bouquet is as if a golfer at Augusta National had missed the fairway and ended up in the pine straw. While he waited for his partner to hit his ball, he dropped the big, juicy grapefruit he was eating into the pine straw. Hints of biscuit malt come through as well. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for this style. The oiliness is very pleasing and complimentary to the flavor/aroma. This is a masterfully balanced IPA. Everything works together to deliver a whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experience. It not only involves, it demands the attention of your sight, olfactory, taste, and tactile senses.

285,"2013-03-23",4.8,"I split a 16.9oz bottle with Chad of Chadz Beer Reviews (thanks, Chad!).  This was my first time trying Pliny and I was worried that it wasnt going to live up to the monumental hype.  I consider myself a hophead, and I tend to love the big, juicy, citrusy IPAs, so I knew that this could very well be the perfect beer for me.

Appearance: Its a beautiful, crystal clear golden color with a nice white fluffy head.  It looks great in a glass.

Aroma: A big grapefruit juice bomb on the nose, this beer has a huge tropical fruit basket aroma that welcomes the drinker in.  There is a touch of pine, but not much of one.

Taste: The aroma carries through into the palate, bringing that giant grapefruit and tropical fruit bomb in force.  The initial hit is a mammoth bitterness, almost all grapefruit, and it dries out a little in the finish and in the aftertaste, with a touch of a pine resin flavor coming through in the end.

Mouthfeel: It was not as carbonated as I expected, but I wouldnt go as far as to call it tepid.  The drinkability is off the chart.

Overall: Pliny is fantastic.  In my review video, I made note that it may not be the best beer Ive ever had in my life, but its certainly in the pantheon of amazing beers.  I may go as far as to say its one of my favorite DIPAs ever; its that good.

285,"2013-02-01",4.5,"Hey look at that, a beer I rated on paper 9 months ago and it was just too darned special to enter right away.... so here goes for 2400!
A bottle bottle generously bonused to me by ineedbeer within maybe a week or two of its bottling date! 
The beer pours a golden color with a big fluffy white  head and a nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is piney and herbaceous. There are some fruit forward elements like pine and orange-peel, a little mild alcohol character slips in there as well. The beer is remarkably aromatic and hoppy. 

The flavor is piney with some big citrus character. The bitterness is fairly high, but its not unbalanced, astringent or unpleasant in any way. Lots of grapefruit flavor, the alcohol character is very mild and some nice flavors of melon rind and honey are very light but complimentary to the whole. 

The mouth feel fairly prickly & the beer does that tongue bracing sensation that really great hoppy beers seem to do.  


And now for a bonus rate: 
My brother-in-law Dwain crushed this beer with me. Dwain is a Budweiser enthusiast who recently gave me a call to let me know about the new ""Budweiser Black Crown""... when Dwain saw me writing notes he asked me to take down a few of his own. So here goes....
Aroma:
This beer smells like pine.

Flavor: 
Really piney. Sort of salty, might be a good beer to add a little salt to.

Overall:
Im just shocked at how good this beer tastes. This isnt even a lager!

500 ml bottle split three ways, served in a Surly Darkness snifter. Big thanks to my girlfriend who got this for me for Christmas.

A: Pours a clear golden straw color with a very lively body. A fluffy pure white head forms on the pour and recedes to a thick collar that leaves lots of lace down the glass.

S: Subtle fruits are present, mostly pears and apples, with a little bit of grassy hops thrown in for good measure. The solid caramel malt backbone is well integrated.

T: Malty body with some subtle citrus type fruits. Follows the nose pretty well. There are some herbal/grassy qualities as well.

M: Off the charts drinkability. I can drink this like water. Its so smooth, just the right carbonation level to keep you interested. Buttery mouth feel.

O: Well its not a game changer by any stretch of the imagination, but its insanely drinkable. The drinkability and the taste reminds me of a tamed Ephraim from Hill Farmstead.

The most outstanding aspect of this beer is that initial flavor just after you swallow: its like a fruity bouquet of awesomeness explodes in your mouth-- like Fruit Stripe gum. Amazing smooth for 100 IBU, alcohol is amazingly well hidden. I feel like this could be a session beer, if not for the cost... And ABV. The best IPA Ive had, or likely will ever have.","Ithaca, New York, USA","Changed"

The aroma is full of citrus, some floral notes, and some sweet notes like tangerine/orange, nice and crisp, mostly hops in the nose. The taste is pretty amazing, some of the bitterness can be strong on the first taste but once the malts catch up on the tongue, by the second taste it settles in to be incredibly balanced with sweetness. The malts are nice and caramally (is that a word?) with maybe some breadiness to them. The hops are strong in citrus flavor. The body of the beer falls pretty inline with other double IPAs as a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation.

Appearance: Pours a clear medium gold with a 2-3 finger fluffy eggshell white head. Nice head retention and lacing.

Smell: Amazing bouquet of hops featuring sweet citrus, grapefruit and pineapple with sweet malt and just a touch of pine and alcohol.

Taste: Ruby red grapefruit, pineapple and tangerine up front followed by caramel malt in the middle before ending with a blast of pine, lemon zest and just a touch of alcohol at the finish. Extremely well-balanced flavor. Aftertaste is bitter and long-lasting. Maybe my favorite aftertaste to date.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This one goes down very easily for a beer with 8% ABV. 

Overall: Amazing beer overall. This beer is incredibly hyped and deservedly so. The only other DIPA that I would compare to it is Bells Hopslam from 2011 (2012 was far too boozy for me and not very balanced, in my opinion). If you see it, try it.

285,"2012-06-21",5.0,"Why do I give Pliny the Elder a perfect 5?

Because i drink it the only way its meant to be drunk- perfectly fresh.

I am such the Pliny connoisseur, that I will not drink it if its a month old, and I hesitate to drink it at 2 weeks old. 

Perfectly fresh is best, but 1 week old is still golden- literally and metaphorically.

Then, you get the full-on Pliny True Experience- a perfect score in all aspects. 

Once those hops begin to die, once the ""life"" of the beer wanes, the MAGIC dissipates... but until then, you get something more from Pliny, something lacking in the vast majority of other, deader beers.

I could go on and on about the tan sheen of Brazillian supermodel ass, the fragrant nose of decomposing Nordic pine needles, the flavors of Afghani copper smelted with diamondback venom-

But the fact of the matter is, Pliny is something to be experienced fresh and only fresh, and then you will FEEL the superb intoxication of a LIVE beer, and the magical intoxication of FRESH HOPS, and understand for yourself.","","Gorblod"

285,"2012-04-08",5.0,"Sometimes a beer is so good its almost hard to explain the taste. Pliny the Younger is not what I would consider a ""complex"" palate in the traditional manner, but the tastes that are there are so strong and so delectable its an absolutely joy from the first sip to the last drop.

I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass

Appearance: A beautiful shade of light orange/dark yellow which is slightly hazy and also bubbly. It forms a bright white, frothy head which leaves generous lacing on the glass. 

Smell: The aroma is as appealing as a beer can smell. As soon as I popped the cap I could smell the rich floral and citrus notes. Its a mélange of tropical fruits and fresh flowers with a very ""clean"" scent overall. 

Taste: Much like the nose, the body is a mash of sweet tropical fruit juice made from orange, tangerine and grapefruit, with perhaps a bit of mango or papaya. Its tart, like a glass of freshly-squeezed lemonade but without the sugary notes. The hops make the palate very crisp, but just like the scent, they finish clean. 

Ive had other IPAs from around the country that are so highly hopped and bitter they tend to tear up my palate like eating and entire box of Sour Patch Kids. While Pliny the Elder is noticeably bitter throughout, the aftertaste is surprisingly gentle and quite refreshing. 

Drinkability: The caveat to strong-tasting beers is they tend to be difficult to drink or their palate overall is simply an acquired taste. I dont think thats true of Pliny The Elder since the citrus flavor is something any beer drinker is used to, combined with the fact its not heavy or rough in the mouth. This beer goes down very smooth and the aftertaste lingers without wearing on the tongue.

Im not usually a fan of imperial or even ""bigger"" beers, but when brewed correctly the alcohol is almost irrelevant. If I didnt know Pliny The Elder was 8% ABV I never wouldve guessed this since there is zero booze present in the nose or the body. I only felt a slight buzz after I drank the beer, although this could be due to the fact it was so good I drank it rather quickly.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

285,"2012-04-06",4.6,"Bottled 3/7/12. Appearance: clear golden amber color, big white frothy head with decent retention and some alcohol legs. Aroma: beautiful grapefruit, floral/honeysuckle, some pine needle, touch of bready/caramel malt. Taste: oh so very smooth!  Nice grapefruity citrus burst at the front, with the bitter citrus pith coming in the middle lasting throughout, finishing with nice floral sweetness lingering a bit then lingering with that long, wonderful bitterness. Mouthfeel: fairly thin, oily, with a dryness. Overall: well, this is the one that I wondered when Id ever get to try it.  It really is an amazing DIPA that is understandably the root of all west coast IPAs.  I love many others that have their specific strong hop characteristics that stand out, but this one is just a perfectly smooth version that just kind of tastes like its an original that all others have grown from.  Its just a pure version of the style.","","scooter520"

First was really fresh and, due to my poor knowledge and free from the impact of the REAL WC-IPA, I stated as one of the best beer ever had before. Second wasnt so fresh. Third was even freshier than the first, but now I reach a better level of the style knowledge and more able to judge. So what? Well, aroma and taste are difficult to describe. You should have. And after, astonished from a so complex but perfectly balanced profile: hops arent the classic punch in your nose that of DIPAs in general, but rich and complete: grapes, citrus, grapefruit, resin, green apple, pineapple. Taste is incredibly crisp, fresh and satisfactory. A medium body that fills mouth between bitterness and fruit. And you dont believe its a DIPA: probabiy its the heaven and hell, lacks something strong (not aggressive. *Strong*), and the reason for which isnt the *best* DIPA ever for me. But surely in the top three, a step under the Mongo I think. Apart from that, Pliny the Elder has something thatll never bore you. Alcohol? Haha.

Pliny is great looking right from the start. A slightly hazy orange amber color with a tight fluffy white head, with a few large errant bubbles on top. Some resplendent carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass. Pretty good retention, and there are rings of lacing down the glass.

There is an elegant aroma, extremely hoppy but oh so balanced on the nose. Pineapple, grapefruit, a bit of orange, and tons of pine overwhelm my olfactory system. 

The taste starts out and stays strongly hoppy the whole way through. Such a wide range of flavors that all work well together. Pine is the single strongest noticeable flavor, but orange, pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of herbal goodness are present throughout each sip. The malt is not of the same strength as the hops, but it does not let me down like in some pure hop bombs. Some soft sweetness and a little spicy flavor keeps me interested. Lingering bitterness after the sip, but I do not mind it.

There is not a way to make this smoother while keeping the great crisp feel. The carbonation is not overdone, but it is a smooth operator, bringing a great pop to the taste.

Poured into a Harpoon Tulip at 55 Degrees F. Bottled on January 8th so its about 2 weeks old.
A - Poured aggressively and produced a 4 finger head. The golden haze reminds me of a lighter 120 Minute IPA with a lot more tiny particles floating around like its going out of style. Head subsided to 1 finger after 5 minutes.
S - HOPS! So much hop and bitterness, its remarkable. Heady Topper, Hopslam and 120 Minute got together and had a baby.Pine, vanilla, cream, citrus all in unison singing loud to the heavens.
T - On fire! Theres so much going on here. Citrus and some candy notes like candy corn or lemonheads are in here. Its such a fulfilling taste that I dont even know what to say. I love the aftertaste of malt that just lingers on and on!
M - This is a deep but still medium beer with a load of carbonation that isnt overpowering. Its so drinkable! 
O - To be so strong and full of flavors, I can gulp this beer and its no problem...if only Pliny grew on trees. This beer is something everyone on BA should try. Search after this one and drink it carefully because its not so easy to find for most east coasters.""","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

285,"2012-01-25",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2013 Draft.  First taste ever.  And while I had been drinking pretty much all day up to this point, I was able to jot down some notes as I am pretty sure it will be a while before I get to taste again.  Pours a bright orange that is just slightly unclear.  Smell was every kind of hop smell thrown togehter - pine, resin, grapefruit, sweet tropical fruits. I could certainly put this as one of the best smelling beers ever.  Taste was quite bitter with pine and resin lending to a very smooth tropical mango and apricot with grapfruit.  Then the good malt backbone come in to slightly balance.  Very, very good IPA.  Close to my favorite, but I am going to reserve that for a few others.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"

It is not even such a complex beer, all is straight and simple but damned good and balanced. Golden color, white rich head, good lacing. Aroma of Pine (classic american IPA trademark), Citrus (tangerine and orange mostly), pale malt, flowers. Taste of malt, hops, pine, a little bit of resin and a perfectly mixed caramel malt note. Medium body, round mouth feel quite bitter, crisp but you can get some sweetness too. Alcohol: is there any alcohol in this beer? Drinkable? They had to invent this word just for this beer i suppose.

285,"2011-12-13",4.1,"Picked a few bottles of this up at Beaumont Market and split all three with the wife today in a pair of twelve ounce tulips I picked up at the Dollar store. The glasses are an awesome value and highly recommended. The Plinys were bottled on 05/26/2010. Ive reviewed this on tap once before but wanted to review the fresh bottle form now as well. On to the review!

The appearance is quite good. The body is a lite yellow gold in color and is very clear with minimal unfiltered sediment goodness in suspension. A few fingers of ivory soapy head hang over the top of the liquid and slowly recedes to a thin cap. Lacing remains where the head formed but doesnt continue down the glass. 

Smell is piney, fresh oily hop, tropical citrusy goodness! Some honey exists as well lending to the wonderful bouquet. It may be the highlight of the drink. 

The taste is mainly oily bitter pine. Sweet tangelos add to the light malt backbone that exists only to embrace that wonderful fresh hop goodness. Some alcohol shows up to lend some warmth to the end of the drink but is in no way unwelcome. 

Is this 8 percent? You couldve fooled me. We plowed through 3 half liters like it was nobodys business and wanted more. The appropriate carbonation helps this go down oh so smooth. I will be looking for this next time it comes to Portland and recommend anybody who sees this available to buy a bottle or three! They can be hard to find so dont pass them up!","St Helens, Oregon, USA","hopsbreath"

very good aromas with good depth. Nice balance of hops with fresh citrus, oranges, hops, and some floral aromas. Doesnt really jump out, but blends together.

Good medium/full body, but lacks a bit on the finish and mid-palate. Very good attack with flavors of oranges, florals and hops.

This is a really good double IPA. It isnt the blow away beer that I expected, but I do wonder if expectations could be met. I know it wasnt the freshest bottle, but it still is a quality beer.","","Newk"

I poured this magnificent brew into a sniffer glass and was rewarded with a medium golden colored brew that gave a fingers worth of fluffy white head and good lacing. The well balanced aromas of citrus, grass and pine pleasantly greet your nose. The taste is amazing, the crispness of citrus was perfectly balanced with a strong malt backbone that left a slightly sharp aftertaste on the tongue. Despite having a relatively high IBU count and above average ABV, this beer is extremely drinkable. I cant help but think, this is the perfect DIPA!","California, USA","topher_78"

Taste is just so balanced and suttle. Juicy hops, pine, grapefruit, some crispy hop forward thing going on, bright citrus fruits, orange peel, some tropical notes aswell leading to a dry bitter end. This is just so clean in its style. I kinda understand the hype behind this! Drinkable? - Yes!","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"

Nose: medium pine and citrus aroma.

Palate: Like the nose, pine and citrus, fairly malty sweet, however the malts are rather uninteresting (unlike a Union Jack!).

Conclusion: This is a solid double IPA, but it is rather pedestrian. It has been hyped up over the years and  that is the mystique behind it. I certainly wouldnt turn down a pint of it, but there are certainly better double ipss out there such as Boneyards hop Venom, Firestone Walkers Double jack, or Old Schoolhouses Imperial IPA.","West Coast, Oregon, USA","authenticmead"

285,"2011-11-28",4.3,"Bottle. The pour was a medium clear yellow with a slight amber hue and a large (2-3 finger) white frothy head that lasted throughout and had good lacing that  spottily stuck to the glass.

The aroma gets you right away with strong grassy and citrus hops, grain malts and a moldy cobweb scented yeast with notes of orange peel and lemon zest.

The taste was ever so nicely bitter-sweet and slightly malty with a touch of lemon at first then had a nice hoppy bitterness come through with a nice does of orange peel at the end. The flavor lasted a good long time allowing for the hops and citrus to blend really well leaving a wonderful lingering aftertaste.

Mouthfeel was light to medium in body with a nice dry texture and a soft carbonation.

Overall an extremely good tasting IPA with all factions (hops, malts and citrus) blending together to form a very unique tasting experience. I can see now why it is referred to as the pinnacle of IPAs.","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

Smells like fresh grapefruit and hops. Bright light-orange color with a medium lacy foam. Tastes a little sweet at first, followed by tart citrus, and finishing with bitter hops. Very nice palate- very crisp and fresh tasting. Flavors of grapefruit, honey, and massive hops at the finish. I have now tasted the legend, and yes, I would love to try it again.

285,"2011-10-28",4.7,"Here it is, one of the most talked-up beers on the planet.  For the DIPA style, I found it the most shining example.  It is nearly perfect in every aspect; it is beer zen in a glass.  I enjoyed a bottle which was not quite 1 month old so it was still appetizingly fresh.  On the nose, I was picking up scents of juicy pineapple, citrus rind, bready pungent hops, candied grapefruit, sappy pine (herbal and intense) and a touch of grassy bitterness.  The palate was a rich and well-blended dose of fresh hop, citrus zest, exotic bitter fruit and melon.  The beer has a beautiful amberish color with a 1 finger head that leaves intricate lacing down the glass.  This IPA is so complex and well-balanced that I am still surprised by it.

285,"2011-10-04",4.4,"Ported from BA.

Appearance: 
Clear and golden orange with bubbles popping up. A foamy white head developed up to about 2 1/2 fingers, at which point I had to start pouring. Medium retention and some lots of lace.

Smell:
Sweet and soft with lots of citrus smells and some piney undertones. Makes me think of grapefruit and fresh apricot.

Taste:
Pine and dry grapefruit dominates, and the fresh (but not sweet) apricot aroma comes through even more. Sweet malt on the backend with low-medium bitterness, making for a pleasant balance. After a bit, most of the flavors peel off of your tongue, with the exception of the pine and pale malt.

Mouthfeel:
Medium bodied, medium but very soft carbonation. Bubbles arent at all harsh on the tongue.

Overall:
This is a really solid IPA. It isnt really overpowering in any one flavor category, and certainly tastes delicious in all of them. What youve got here is one solid beverage that I could see myself enjoying regardless of the weather. Still, bonus if a hammock is involved.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

It actually can remind me a bit of that fantastic shampoo my girlfriend is using a.t.m. Flavors: Really nice! My god! This has to bee the smoothest beer Ive ever tasted. It has a average carbonation level and a mild and extremely smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel! This is truly one of those beers thats just melting on the tongue! Flavors are not to extreme at all.

The beer has a wonderful piny hop characteristic that is clean up front but finishes with a nice strong malt flavor that lingers on the palate.

Lots of rich flavors on the nose. First smells that come to mind are citrus, pine and grapefruit. Lots of hops.

First taste was hops. Second was the grapefruit/pine combination, before giving way to a smooth alcohol bite/bitterness ending. 

A great balance and very smooth for just a hoppy beer. Very refreshing that had me looking forward to the next sip.

Body is golden, only slightly hazy, with fairly big and rich head. Aroma is hoppy goodness. Citrus, pine, herbs, tropical fruits (pineapple, passion fruit). Taste is equally hoppy, but what I really like about this beer is how it balances out towards the end. The finish is fairly rich but not overly long or bitter. Its got some malty sweetness to the end, but it never gets too much as it can with some DIPAs. In a way, I think more of this as a very balanced IPA rather than as a DIPA.

I really feel like my summer allergies are keeping me from enjoying this beer as much as I should. The aroma is a little weaker than expected. Full of those Northwestern hops we love so much, but not really dancing off the glass like a beer with this much hops should. Poured a crystal-clear true gold, which I suppose is apropos for this beer.

Flavor is a lot sweeter than expected. It really balances out the intense hops well. 8% ABV, 90-something IBU, and still very quaffable. This speaks to the mastercraft on display here.

Overall, I get what all the hype is about, but just. This beer didnt change my life and Im not going to quit my job, leave my fiancee and move to Santa Rosa, but this definitely vaults in to the upper echelon of IPAs and IIPas Ive had along with Three Floyds Alpha King, Boulevard Double Wide, and Racer 5.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","dougdecinces"

285,"2011-08-17",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2013 Served on-tap into a snifter at TJs 7th anniversary party. Not the first time I have had this one but still one of the best.


A - Pours deep, hazy, orange with a small cap of white head that stays strong throughout the entire glass leaving thick lacing down the glass.


S - Strong piney, citrus, hops hit you full blast. A bit of sweetness from the malt helps balance it out but once it begins to warm up, more and more hops keep coming out. Absolutely intoxicating.


T - Starts with a bit of pale malts giving way quickly to a massive onslaught of citrus hops. Finish is a bit sweet with lingering hop biternes. I have had this beer quite a few times now and it is still one of the best beers I have ever had. One of the best DIPAs out there.


M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tons of hop bitterness in the finish that lingers for some time. Very good but it could be a tiny bit better.


O - I think I could drink this every day for the rest of my life. With out a doubt one of the best DIPA on the market today. My personal favorite, thats for sure. I am so glad I live near philly.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

285,"2011-05-03",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2013 Original rating:
Orange golden colour, firm off-white head.
Very pronounced hoppy aroma. Floral and grapefruit. Cascade, citra and Amarillo? Very pleasant to say the least. Nice malty touch.
Some malt sweetness, but mostly very pronounced hops in the taste, though surprisingly restrained. The overkill of hops definitely helps the aroma. The smell is brilliant, it circulates through your mouth. Pine, grapefruit, tree blossoms. Finish is very hoppy and very long lasting. Here the sheer amount of hops is really noticeable, for quite a while it even overshadows everything you eat or drink after it.

Tasting 2nd bottle I stand by my first notes, but wonder how I can have missed the pronounced lychee in both smell and flavour.

Update: 12 May 2013:
Compared in a tasting of three fresh double IPAs, head to head with fresh Borg Úlfur Úlfur and De Dochter van de Korenaar Extase, all bottled in April 2013. Pliny was the most bitter one, though not by a great margin. I am surprised to say there is no clear winner.

The aroma hops are the star of this show.  Highly aromatic, with the main character being a citrusy, piny hop blast.

Not overbearingly bitter for the true hopaholic, but quite bitter nonetheless and even against a robust malt profile, the bitterness takes over quite a bit.

For the style, it has everything a double IPa should have.  A robust malt profile to take the edge off the extreme hoppiness, a full mouthfeel owing to the high gravity and a beautiful white head with great retention owing to the high gravity and heavy hopping.  

Alcohol is barely detectable.  A great beer to drink a small glass of, or eat a meal with, but it does wreak some havoc on the palate if you drink too much.  

If you like double IPAs, youll love this beer.  And if you like IPAs but find the doubles to be overbearing, this beer is somewhere between the two styles so it shouldnt be too much to handle if you like hoppy pale ales or IPAs.  If youre not big on hops however, stay away.  This brew isnt as over the top as many IIPAs, but it remains a resinous, syrupy hop blast.","","alexjucla"

285,"2011-03-31",4.4,"Beer poured a bottle dated 10/08/09, so its a month old. Pretty good for a trade (THANKS!). Beer served in a goblet. Beer is yellow and hazy, carbonation is mild to moderate. A white head of medium sized bubbles formed but the head collapsed. There is some lacing left on the glass, even after the head collapses. Head gravitates toward the walls of the glass.

Beer has that sweet pine smell of hops. This is a double IPA but I dont smell any malt really. Not any alcohol either.

This beer tastes wonderful. The hops are obvious but the beer overall is so smooth, its amazing. Some of these hop bombs leave an acidic taste in the back of the mouth. Finishes cleanly but the beer in general leaves a film all over you mouth. Second taste, its almost as if it finishes dry but starts wet. The beer isnt dry at all, but its finish is so nice.

Mouthfeel is great. There is plenty of flavor to connect some (the tiny amount) of sweetness at the front with the hop bitterness and flavor. Its so good. Medium body, cant taste the alcohol at all. Drinkability very high. This is one of the best DIPAs Ive ever had in my life. I wish this were sold locally. If you cant get it locally, set up a trade to get this beer.

285,"2011-02-23",4.7,"Érdekes, hogy az amerikai IPA-őrület egyik központi söre a mainstreammel tökéletesen ellentétes irányba indul. Sötétsárga színét fehér, szépen csipkéződő hab koronázza. Az illata először intenzív sárgadinnye, vagy inkább sárgadinnye-rágó, majd lassan némi sajtos lábszag társul hozzá, ami a legkomolyabb IPA-k velejárója.
Az első korty aztán színesíti a képet valami nagyon határozott kenderes jelleggel. A sárgadinnye és a kender aromái együtt egy kifejezetten üdítő ízképet adnak ki. Noha ez egy 8%-os dupla IPA, a teste közepes, kifejezetten könnyen iható sör, nem is emlékeztet a dupla IPA-k fülledt exkluzivitására, olyan, mintha egy mindennapi ivásra szánt sört innánk, aminek gyönyörű és szokatlan ízei vannak.
A komlóképlet szintén az amerikai álom cáfolata. Határozottan európai földes komlók viszik a primet, melyek némi gyomnövényes ízen át a kenderhez is szépen idomulnak (vagy lehet, hogy a kenderesség is csak valamelyik komló tudománya?).

From the moment you pry off the cap hop fumes fill your nostrils.

It pours a light orangeish gold, almost like a Helles lager with and orange tint. It is a pretty unique color. The head is bright white and compact, it leaves some decent lacing.

The smell is phenomenal on this one. A cornucopia of hoppage, with scents of citrus, pine, and a hint of sweetness.

The flavor is also amazing. A barrage of grapefruit, lemon, bitterness and pine hit you like a freight train. There is a subtle bit of malt that provides some sweetness and rounds out the taste, but dont let this fool you, this is hoppier than your average DIPA. It is a hop bomb to the fullest. The bitterness is overt but not offensive in the least. The mouthfeel is perfect, subtable for a massive hop delivery with a medium body and prickly, active, though not overt carbonation.

As far as a DIPA goes this is as drinkable as it gets, not only does it smell and taste like heavenly hop nectar, the alcohol is nonexistent. The bitterness is never tiring, but assuming you are a DIPA lover like me, you wont even think of it anyways.

This is one damn fine beer, it just edges out FFF Dreadnaught as my favorite in the category. It may not be as epic as people tout it to be but as far as DIPAs go it may just be the king.

A nice toast and caramel sweetness matches up well against the typical northwest hop flavor profile - big grapfruit and resinous hop notes, finishing up with a moderately bitter and nicely dry finish.  Very good.","san jose, California, USA","mayday035"

Drank it on 01/07/11, bottled on 12/17/10 so the hops were there in full force. For the build up to trying this, I was some what let down. The hops were bright and powerful, but I felt it lacked a malt backbone. I do enjoy west coast IPAs, but I just felt the beer wasnt balanced enough for all of the hype. I know that is sacrilege on here, but thats how I feel, personally I prefer a more malt balanced DIPA, like a DFH 90 min or Lagunitas Hop Stoopid.

Aroma is of course dominated by hops but not just the usual resinous and grassy stuff but real thoroughbred hoppy goodness. It feels like sniffing pure hop-pellets which I find to be a very enjoyable practice, by the way. Simcoe dominates with lemon and lime. It has grass and pine as well as exotic fruits, while remaining sophisticated and complex with a nice burnt caramel/sugar balance. Pure west-coast hoppiness with a mild sugary presence.

This is my yardstick for a good IPA.  The nose is easily the best of any beer I have ever experienced.  There is no way of calculating the depths of hoppy, herby, spicy aromas that come of this beer.  The taste lives up to the aroma, deep, diverse hoppy herby flavors, and a perfect amount of sweet malt to round everything out.","California, USA","bigabe"

Taste follows the aroma.  Big pinch of hop bitterness with an equal dose of sweet, tropical fruit flavor from the hop.  And so smooth.  It bites and makes you want more.  Buttery biscuit malt follows but the finish is a dry piney hop.  Mildy sticky.

This beer is not in competition to be the biggest beer or the most hops.  Rather, it presents a manifestly smooth but powerful hop.  Lush tropical fruity hops dominate.  Its like hop juice distilled to the perfect point.","Virginia, USA","birderbeerer"

Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy off white head that disappears quickly. Nose is hops, lovely piny resinous grapefruity hops. Leans more towards the pine than to the citrus side. Taste is pretty much a citrus and pine explosion that leaves the mouth coated with bitter hop oils. I cant find any malt here, but Im okay with it. Finish is dry, but the taste lingers begging you to take another sip.

285,"2011-01-28",4.6,"A trip to Monks in Philly rewarded me with another success in the ongoing Quest for the Hole Ales! Right off the tap, this one pours with a divine glow through a rich deep amber filter supporting a medium tall dusky beige rocky head with enough velvety lacing to satisfy Sean Penns appetite for privacy.  The aroma is that of a pine forest canopy (if pine forests had canopies) and a grapefruit orchard.  An aggressive but still carefully balanced grapefruity, spruce hop bomb explodes as you take your first few sips.  The hops are unrelenting but amazingly well restrained at the same time due to a solid malty, bready backbone.  Rich, creamy mouthfeel and a lasting finish thats both bracingly bitter and sultry smooth at the same time.  Theres a reason this is a world class standard.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"
285,"2011-01-28",4.4,"Bottle from Nugget Market. Poured into my trusty tulip glass. When I first opened the bottle, the immediate smell of the hops came wafting out and filled my senses with the grassy mellowness. The color as I poured was a hazy golden-pale with a very active head, showing off just how frothy this guy is. The aroma was then more abundant with the smell of roasted malts hiding in the back. In the front, the very grassy floral scent was welcoming with a side of citrus fruits. Tasting it, the sudden bitterness from the hops was there, but it didnt take over like I thought it would. Med. bitterness with very minimal sweetness. The carbonation helps tone it down as it finishes abruptly. Light bodied but still creamy. Ok, so Im usually not down for IPAs at all (I pretty much steer away) but just the reputation alone had me try this. I have to say Im pretty damn pleased with it!

285,"2011-01-10",4.3,"Bottle dated 11.22.2010. Enjoyed on 01.07.11. Generously received from BA HoldensHomebrew.

Pours a slightly cloudy persimmon orange with a foamy, one-finger white head. Settles down to a ring of head and one straggling group of bubbles, with thick-bubbled lacing.

The combination of pine, citrus, grapefruit, and floral hoppiness is not unique to Pliny the Elder, but the complexity here is deeper; this is a case where clarity through words is hard to come by. The pine is sweetened through what smells like caramelized sugar; imagine sugared grapefruit for breakfast and youre close. 

Lots of citrus and resinous flavor without imparting too much lingering bitterness. Theres more caramel backing than I expect or remember (the bottle may be just a week or two ""older"" than perfect), but its really driven by the grapefruit and citrus bitterness. As I get further in, I pick up on some orange and just a hint of sweeter tropical fruit notes - this is my favorite part of the beer, coming in mid-to-late palate and only as I get further through the glass. 

Medium-full bodied without medium carbonation. Somewhat sticky without distracting.

The standard for a style I dont always appreciate. Drinking this now, it brings back memories of sub-par DIPAs of the past, really putting them to shame. Other DIPAs roam the earth, ghostlike, growing ever staler and hoping to be like Pliny. Vinnie does no wrong.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

285,"2010-12-08",4.2,"Pliny the Elder is a great IPA. It pours a golden yellow color with a white head and great retention. There isnt much lacing though, but that isnt that big of a deal. The aroma is very floral and perfumes of hops. You can tell that this is an IPA by the aroma and if you like IPAs youll appreciate it all the better. The flavor is kinda tricky to me cause Im not too accustomed to IPAs but it did start off with a good breadiness. The flavor kinda turns citrus-like and finished with a hoppy explosion that IPA lovers will rejoice in. This is way up there in my favorite IPA brews and is a great beer in and of itself.

285,"2010-11-28",4.5,"16.9 oz. bottle. Consumed on 11-26-10. Bottled on 100610, which Im assuming means October 6, 2010. Picked up for me by my mom on a recent trip to California; thanks, Mom! Beautiful smell is floral and dry but not astringent. Apricot, pine, peach, and rose scents. Fantastic. Its hard to imagine a more lovely aroma. Pours a slightly hazy, highly effervescent, shiny, bright but deep orange-ish gold color. Moderate amount of uneven, moderately thick, off-white head. Extensive, long-lasting lacing. The flavor nicely matches the aroma. Perfectly balances the floral fruitiness of American hops with the floral fruitiness of English-style malts and an unyielding but wonderful dryness. Peach and apricot flavors with a hint of orange. Nice and spicy. A complex, totally inoffensive dryness in the finish. Very long, dry aftertaste. Oily, frothy, and lively in the palate. Medium to full body. Easy to drink yet begs to be savored. Russian River Pliny the Elder definitely is one of the best beers Ive ever had, and it is inarguably the most pleasant, like a stroll through a perfectly manicured garden in the English countryside.

285,"2010-11-13",4.2,"Transcription of an old BA review from 04-02-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate....someday.

Bottling date: 1. February 2010 so lets open the bottle before the hops start to deteriorate.
The beer pours slightly hazed liquid-gold with orange to light coppery hue. Head quickly dissipates to a stable bubbly coating.
Aromas are rich and refreshing, like a night walk on the Mediterranean beach with an air filled by wind-carried scents of citruses (predominantly grapefruit), pines and cypresses, resin of coniferous trees and elder blossom. Besides citrusy hop character, another kind of fruitiness derived from either hops or fruity esters is evident and clean malty sweetness penetrates through the thick sheets of aromas. Excellent. Flavors showing less diversity then the nose suggested are of grapefruit and coniferous resins; semi-dry finish with lingering unharsh bitterness. The light-medium body is delicately carbonated. Finally, but not least important the eruption of finest hop qualities was crowned by nearly complete absence of perceivable alcohol.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

285,"2010-10-16",4.5,"For mainstream beer drinkers, a balanced beer is midpoint between hoppy and malty with none of the distinguishing characteristics of either (read Bud etc.).  For beer enthusiasts, a well balanced beer expresses notes across the beer spectrum: malty without being syrupy, hoppy without being bitter, fruit notes without being fruity and full bodied without heaviness.  Pliny the Elder is a beer that I have heard about for some time.  Unfortunately (not really but for the sake of this post yes), I live on the East Coast in an area where the distributers are not interested in brining it in (read Philistines).  Luckily, Gary at Blackwells in San Fransico stocks Pliny along with a whole assortment of other treasures and he ships pretty much everywhere.  I got ahold of some Pliny recently and sampled it room temperature, slightly chilled and very cold.  I like my beer very cold but I find that it is worthwhile to try it at different temperatures to look for changes in tonal balance and see if different notes predominate.  Pliny was well balanced throughout.  Obviously, the notes were more muted when chilled but no particularly actor hogged the stage.  I was (and still am) impressed by the mellifluous choice of hops, the grapefruit-like citrus quality and subtle malt, backing up the chorus like a smooth baritone.  In short, this s*#t rocks!

Im not a big believer in appearance being even half as important as smell or taste, but PtE is just a sticky monster that looks unbelievable.  Nose is dank, oily hops with a dominant focus on resinous pine scents but also citrusy and even slightly tropical flavors.  The taste follows perfectly behind the nose, a wave of layered fruits and forests with an ever so slight malt crispness to give the beer a perfect roundness and prevent an overwhelming bitterness.  Mouthfeel is full and sticky.  Drinkability is off the charts.  Pliny is the benchmark by which I measure all other beers, the beer which I would most like to have on tap at my local or stockpiled in my fridge.

285,"2010-09-25",4.9,"Pliny the Elder.  The word legendary comes to mind.  Russian Rivers famously hopped IPA has been out of reach for me, at least until now.  A recent excursion to Denver for the GABF yielded a surprisingly bountiful harvest, including a fresh bottle of the Elder.  To say Im excited about finally getting the opportunity to sample this beer would be an understatement.  In many respects, I feel like Ive been waiting my whole life to try this brew.  

Lets get out snifter for this one, it seems appropriate.  Pliny pours a dull gold, with a very nice head that immediately billow up before recedeing, like the tides on the beach.  Shockingly (or not) the nose is pretty much all hops.  Hops hops hops hops hops.  I get some spruce notes up front.  Its this big ass pine nose that is incredible.  It tears at my nostrils like a demon from hell, determined to drag me down.  

Holy cow, this beer is incredible, just based on scent alone.  

The first sip is an assault on the palate.  You arent prepared for this.  But its not bad.  Theres bitterness, but it is pleasant.  Luckily this bottle of Pliny is super-fresh, so I get that scratchy hop characteristic of a beer that was seemingly made yesterday.  The mouthfeel is great.  Its super thick, with this great malt sweetness backing it up.  But its never syrupy.  The light carbonation lends to the overall experience and actually makes it quite easy to drink.  The Elder strikes quite a nice balance.  

Its all about the hops though, and this beer is a hop chameleon.  It seemingly changes with every sip that I take.  I get spruce pine, followed by grass, then citrus, and then flowers.  And, just for good measure, Its generic, I know, but its what I get.  This thing is a hop grenade in your mouth.  Theres a number of hops just sucking you in and then trying to claw their way out of your mouth.  The only way to really appreciate it is by trying it yourself.  Whats incredible is that the malt profile backs it up.  

Wow.  

Its like someone beamed down from another planet with the perfect IPA, and Russian River was bestowed with the recipe.  All others pale in comparison.  Holy crap this thing is fn incredible.  I didnt think I would say this but its totally worth the hype.  Im going to be having dreams about this thing.  

Yes, its that good.  

The hop character draws you in.  I havent had a beer with this kind of amazing hop flavor.  Its so fresh and delicious.  Ridiculous.  But theres a great malty sweetness that backs everything up.  Trying to describe the malt profile is like hitting a moving target  the more you zero in on the sweetness the more the hops come back up and remind you that theyre there.  Man.  Theres simply nothing wrong with this beer.  And honestly, theres only one way to think of this.  

This is the best IPA that Ive ever had.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

285,"2010-09-07",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2014 Poured a gorgeous yellow with a white bubbly head.  Took me and my friends several minutes to catalogue the aromas: pine, grapefruit, banana, and fresh sweat on a clean t-shirt.  Flavor was intense and ponderous.  Was it intensely hoppy and full of pine?  Yes.  Was it that simple?  Goodness no.  This was the most complex and intriguing pine-hops flavour I ever encountered.  Of course it also featured some flowery and grapefruity tones, which Im sure helped the subtle complexities.  It was recognizable without being familiar.  For me, there wasnt enough of a malt balance.  The low carbonation and somewhat creamy mouthfeel were nice touches, but in the end, I felt it was too imbalanced.  Im super glad I had the fortune of trying one, but if I had the opportunity, I wouldnt buy another.------- RERATE------holy amazeballs this is a great beer.  Admittedly I only had a sip from a friends glass, but it blew my hair back.  I dont know if my first Pliny was a mediocre bottle or if I just didnt appreciate hops then, but...wow.

285,"2010-09-02",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2011 First before you taste, youve got to sniff a beer like this and when you do pliny gives off an impressive aroma. Then you glass to lips and drink. When you do this you notice a very powerful flavour of hops but not overpowering. I agree with most that there is a pine like flavor to it. But as you drink more that flavour disapears and it becomes easier to drink. I want to have a couple more bottles before I really know what this beer is about.

285,"2010-07-10",4.1,"500 milliliters bottled on 5/26/2010, served into a 12 ounce brandy snifter, drank at 50 degrees and 55 degrees. Received via phone order from a California store.

Vision
Poured in low light in my front room. It appears at first to be an aged honey color with one finger of snowy white head. When held up to a light source it shifts to the color of movie theater butter while holding its virgin white head. The lacing is truly something to be admired in this brew. It defies gravity on the edges of the snifter and pleases me as I agitate for the bouquet. Long after it has been consumed, a lacing exists around the glass.

Bouquet
Upon first breath it holds a mysterious sweetness that is missing in most double IPAs Ive seen. It takes a second attempt to identify tangerines. The citrus is unique as of this date for my smelling pleasure. There are brief hints of pine but only when searching for more.

Flavor Profile
The smell was not misleading me. Citrus flavors explode initially on the palate and lead me to believe there is tangerines in my brew. They fade appropriately leaving a finish that starts hinting of pine, but quickly erupts into a mouth of tree branch.

The close is like walking through a winter forest looking off into the distance. Calm, quiet, clean. Everything is as it would seem. You notice the snow on the trees around you, but unfortunately you missed that tree branch that just rammed itself into your mouth. A quick punch of pine before it goes down the hatch making you wonder if it was really there as you continue staring at the scenery.

It is not a clean finish, but its damn close. The bitterness lingers pleasantly but does not overwhelm. I welcome it to play with my taste buds. All flavors blend well and play at their allotted times sip after sip. There is no one note, but a grand symphony.

Oral Sensations
When it comes to mouth feel I wasnt expecting the enjoyable body that Pliny has. It flows and lays its gentle head upon my tongue, but after swallowing it only lingers for a moment. The feel is exactly as it should be.

Closing
It is one of the most drinkable DIPAs as of date. No problem consuming the entire bottle solo, and would drink another if desired.

As a double IPA, it is most certainly a pleasant experience but not my favorite one. Bias and hype may have raised my hopes too much for this beer, but that does not mean it didnt come close to meeting some of them.","Illinois, USA","Khazadum"

Smell- Pine. Straight up pine trees. Also has notes of citrus(oranges and grapefruit) and a pleasing maltiness.

Taste- Imagine running through a forest, lets say your being chased by a monster or something(I know, just follow me here ok), and all of a sudden BAM you run right into a bushel of pine tree branches and it all gets into your mouth. Got it? Ok it tastes like that. A pine tree Mike Tyson punch to your mouth. Once you get past the pine tree extravaganza you get a nice hint of citrus and herbs.

Mouthfeel- A little lacking here. It was a bit thin and watery. The carbonation is medium which is nice.

Overall- As DIPAs go I would say this is one of the best Ive ever had. At 8% it makes for a very drinkable beer and Im extremely excited to have been able to try it. Big thanks go out to my boy Devon who brought this back from his trip to Napa.","New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","Beerbuddha"

Aroma is piney, citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, tropical fruits, some floral hops, caramel malt, yeast and bread.  Pretty fruity and sweet, almost sugary for a DIPA, but as it warms the pine and citrus rind really come into play.

Let me tell you, when Vinnie says to drink this beer fresh hes not kidding! Im not saying that the older one was bad, as a matter of fact it was still better than a lot of fresh IIPAs. However, this beer is made to drink early as the label states. Aging doesnt do this beer justice. That being said, the citrus and floral hop aromas that creep out of this beer are tantalizing. Nice golden orange color, somewhat hazy with persistent white head and lacing. Hops over malts (bitterness over sweetness) for sure, but still a nice balance between the two. Medium body with a sticky sensation from the high alpha acids. Medium carbonation and a nice long and beautifully bitter finish.

Just enough maltiness present to balance out this hoppy brew.

Smell: Just a beautiful bouquet of floral hops, a slight grapefruit hop smell, pine, perfume, and the faintest hint of orange. Well done!

Taste: Im getting some grapefruit up front with the pine and floral qualities coming next. Finally another wave of grapefruit hits as the floral qualities subside. This is a tasty west coast IPA for sure! Really loving it. Especially because there isnt a sweet malt profile to detract from it.

Mouthfeel: Creamy, decent carbonation, with fruit sweetness from the hops balancing everything in the absence of a sweet malt profile.

Drinkability: Wonderful despite the 8% abv

Please Note: Pliny changes quite a bit as it ages and really is best enjoyed as fresh as possible. Ive sampled bottles that were 2-3 weeks old and they have extra bitterness about them that opens up in the 4-6 week age range.

285,"2010-05-07",5.0,"This may be my favorite beer of all time. I first had it at a brewfest years ago and nothing has really ever compared. I found a liquor store right down the street that carries the 16.9oz bottles and I couldnt be more excited. Russian Rivers distributors do a wonderful job of ensuring the freshest possible product makes it to their customers and in the case of Pliny the Elder is makes a world of difference. This bottle is dated at 4/5/10 and was poured into a tulip glass. The color is a cloudy golden amber, reminiscent of a Belgian tripel. A rich foamy head arises and it retained with fine lacing. The smell is gloriously fresh and floral hops with enough of a citrus-like honey sweetness to again remind me somewhat of a tripel. The wonderfully bitter hops on the palate are balanced with an interestingly subtle malt that gives the taste an orange peel quality to it. The fresh and resiny hops linger through the finish so much so that its almost like Ive been chewing on a mouthful of them. The carbonation is spot on, giving it exceptional mouthfeel and allowing the full and glorious flavor of the beer to be spread broadly across the palate. Everything combines to make this a beer that beckons to be sipped deeply and savored. I really tried to think of a way this beer might be made better and the only thing I could come up with was if it was on tap fresh at the brewery.

285,"2010-04-26",4.6,"Bottle-Pours radioactive translucent orange with lots of sediment and a huge frothy beige head. Aroma of delicious tropical citrus and bitter pine resin.

I could drink this every day especially for the price.","Washington, USA","Beerona97"
285,"2010-04-23",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2010 500ml from blackwells online.  bottled 032210, drank 042110.  aroma is quite spirity lightning followed by resin and hot pine.  appearance is surprisingly pale for the style, nearly translucent gold with fine head and good lacing.  flavor is a hint spicy, big pine cone crunch and defined grapefruit and lemon burn.  big bitterness satisfies.  exactly the world class IIPA it is expected to be.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
285,"2010-04-23",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2011 16oz draft from the Tap Room in SanDiego. Poured a golden orange color with an inch thick head. Aromas are citrus grapefruit and pine hops. The taste is pretty hop forward, just the way I like it. The malt is present but its quickly overwhelmed by the bitterness from the piney hops.This beer is an excellent IPA that pretty much lived up to the hype. I feel there are others that are better (cough Alpine Bad Boy cough) but there is no doubt this is a fantastic beer.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","arondee"
285,"2010-04-22",4.2,"Bottle via trade with phaleslu, thanks alot Peter. Pours a somewhat hazy, orange-amber with a chunky, oily, slightly over 1 finger eggshell head that has decent retention. Aroma is huge on grapefruit, sweet citrus, toasty grain, light bready biscuit, nice floral notes, mixed tropical fruit, hints of toasted white bread and pot. Flavor is grapefruit, tangerine and orange citrus, sweet malt, light cereal grain, pine, some stanky pot, dusty dried grass, doughy yeast and a crisp limestone hard water note to the bitter citrus, yeast and sweet grain finish. Palate is medium to heavy bodied with a creamy entry, moderate carbonation with just enough sharpness and a still fairly creamy but drying finish. Really great IIPA, it didnt quite live up to my expectations, but I would gladly buy it if it were readily available to me.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
285,"2010-04-22",4.4,"Thanks to Dlucky for this one. My first Russian River experience. Poured into my snifter.

A-Body is a nearly crystal clear vibrant amber and some bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Pours with a one finger foamy white head that quickly subsides to a thin collar but amazingly it leaves traces of lacing all the way down the glass.

S- While the foam is still present the nose is dominated by juicy citrus (grapefruit) hops. When the foam subsides a more spicy hop can be detected.

T- Upfront is lots of almost sweet juicy citrus (mostly grapefruit). Underneath is a hint of malt. Piny hop flavors rise for the finish. It leaves a medium strength residual bitterness behind...which can be overwhelming at first...but as you sip more it becomes more of an underlying spicy compliment to the juicy citrus flavors upfront. Very well done.

P- Medium carbonation and a smooth, somewhat oily, yet light body.

O- This is an excellent DIPA. I have been dying to try Russian River beers ever since I joined BA and this is my first one. I am looking forward to their other brews. This was unfortunately gone too fast. Did I mention that the alcohol was completely hidden?

Note: This is the only beer in my top 50 I am below the rdev on.

A good deal of sweet caramel and tangy oranges upfront taste-wise.  A touch of smooth vanilla in the middle.  Super resiny end with loads of grapefruits, rinds, and some rye.  A lingering dryness.

Unbelievably amazing hoppy aroma, with loads of piney hops and some citrus.

285,"2010-04-07",4.5,"Tasted a 500ml bottle from Mesa Liquor & Wine in San Diego, CA.  VERY nice.  Pours a great hazy honey color; head was relatively thin on my pour, but it did maintain some medium lacing as I drank.  Everything about this beer is very bright and fresh.  A nice, grassy, fresh hop aroma, and the taste is similar, but more powerful--some slight citrus overtones on a wonderful hop flavor that has enough bitterness to be pronounced without becoming off-putting.  This beer seems medium-bodied for an IPA (maybe even has a slightly chewy feel?), but what strikes me the most is how sparkly and effervescent it feels in the mouth.  Overall, I think this is one of my favorite new IPAs, and I cant wait to try it again!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","StormCoat"
285,"2010-04-06",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2010 The beer looks incredible out of the bottle. Its bright and sunshiney with a giant soapy head, like a miniature carbonated bubble bath.  The smell is worth the price of admission. You know that Russian River has really bottled something special as soon as the huge floral scent hits you. Its piney, citrusy and very floral. Its just an incredible scent for a beer. Its somewhere between a dense pine forest and a field of wildflowers. The taste is similarly incredible. Its chock full of hops that taste fresh, like living on a hop farm fresh. You taste the pine and citrus and flowers that are in the nose, and theyve been translated into a great melding of beer flavor. The mouthfeel is great.  I have to hide this beer in the back of my fridge behind cartons of milk and carefully balanced glass jars, just so I wont drink it the same day that it comes home.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Palate: some initial sweetness and then big, strong hoppiness.  The hops are citrusy and powerful, but not overwhelming.  The finish is long, dry, and very bitter - but in a good way.  This beer does everything right.  There are loads of hops but they are there for a good reason and are well balanced by the sweetness and malts (unlike other double IPAs where they are just added to claim the most hoppy or highest IBUs).

Aroma is almost perfect...orange peel, resin, pine, grapefruit and a bit of toffee. The taste is even better.

Again big juicy fruit flavors, good amount of pine resin, some honey malt sweetness through the middle, decent amount of spiciness near the finish.

285,"2010-03-18",4.3,"500ml bottle dated 3/4/10.  Had many bottles and pints of this, but I suppose its time to rate it.  This bottle pours a bit more hazy than others Ive had.  Deep golden with uniform white head and tons of great lacing.  Nose is right in my wheelhouse with tons of resin, citrus and light sweetness.  The haze on this batch is giving a bit more body feel compared to other batches Ive had...Im digging that.  Carb is tight and prickly as always.  Sweet honey and bitter citrus notes up front.  Sharp peppery and grassy bitterness in the mid palate...sweetness and bitter then both take turns popping out moving into a perfect amount of bittering to finish.  Doesnt rip the enamel off your teeth or just punish your palate, but let you know you are drinking a iipa.  Not much more to say that hasnt been said already.

285,"2010-03-15",4.1,"Enjoyed from a 16.9oz bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a slightly-darker-than-straw-colored yellow hue, with a small but long-lasting white head.  Strong and complex notes of west coast hops to the nose.  The palate is initially quite bitter, carrying notes of grapefruit and pine.  Following is a slight note of malt character; but what seems to set the beer apart is its dryness.  This is especially evident when the beer is sampled alongside another double IPA, such as Bells Hopslam.  The finish is dry and clean, making the beer tremendously drinkable, for its heft.  Overall, a splendid experience.  There is little doubt why it is so heralded.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"
285,"2010-03-15",4.9,"Bottle.

A - Hazy golden orange with a good sized white, foamy head.

S - Big fruity hop smell. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, orange, and just a little lemon. Good amount of pine too.

T - Similar to the smell. Lots of hops, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, lemon, pine, as well as some floral and other earthy flavors. Considering all this, it isnt too bitter. There is bitterness present, but there are so many other flavors it doesnt seem overpowering. The fruit flavors provide a very subtle sweetness along with some pale malt as well.

M - Medium to full body with good carbonation. Very creamy and smooth.

D - Great drinkability. Goes down easy and taste wonderful. The hop flavors work so well together and it is quite refreshing. Would love to sit back and enjoy a few, unfortunately the ABV (and at the moment availability) prevents that somewhat.

Notes: Wonderful beer with lots of West Coast type of hop flavors. Really good mix of hops that compliment each other. Also considering what it is and the amount of hops that are tasted, it is well balanced. There is a nice bitterness, but that is more in the background.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

285,"2010-03-12",4.2,"Bottled on - 011410.

Appearance: Pours out a clear, brilliant, pale gold body with a sudsy, enduring, white head.

Smell: Quite a vibrant nose with many a perfumy aromatic - expressive notes of fresh florals, citrus oils, resinous pine, and even peaches fill the air. 

Taste: Starts with a simple introduction of extra pale malts with some cracker tones to it and a relatively light sweetness. Flavors of oily lemon peelings, pine needles swimming in sap, meadow flowers, white grapefruit, and even white peaches usher in a bold bitterness. Picks up some spicy accents on the back end. As one would expect, it finishes dry and bitter with a lingering resinous quality.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Has a slight oily slickness to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: After well over a thousand reviews, Im not sure what there is left to be said. PtE is a stalwart of the style. Drinks with comparative ease considering the bold bitterness and staunch dryness, with almost no notice of the alcohol presence.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

285,"2010-02-23",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2012 500ml bottle (bottled 8/19/09) from StFun...thanks Josh! - Pours nice golden amber with a small off-white head. The nose is less hoppy than what I expected, with more peach than citrusy hops. Light malt smells like a sugar cookie. Smooth and resiny in the mouth, with that same peach taste, caramel malt, and a dry, grassy finish. Not bad at all, though not the religious experience I might have expected.

I really like the sweet aftertaste that takes just enough of the bite away as if to say ""hush hops hush, no need to fuss"".. classic example of a CALI MICRO IPA.. hop hound monster and very good...","Washington DC, USA","shakespeare33"

It was the top of my hit-list when I went to San Francisco and it was the first and then the penultimate beer of my trip (Racer 5 was the last beer, and for me R5 is just better). I had a few pints of it, the most memorable being a super-cloudy, electric-orange pint in the Toronado which didnt clear at all. It was smooth and fruity, pithy, juicy, full bodied, smooth, peachy, orangy, a grapefruit dryness, apricots, tropical fruit, great drinkability. Just a great beer.

285,"2010-02-16",4.7,"My first impression of this beer was that it was very good, but not necessarily worth all the hype. Its not at all syrupy; rather, its of the fresh, clean, crisp hop variety, slightly citrusy and floral. It reminded me somewhat of the Founders Double Trouble, but a bit thicker and not quite as lemony. It also reminded me a bit of the Green Flash Imperial IPA, in that it also gave me, to a lesser extent, that oddly enticing cat piss smell and taste (maybe its a California IPA thing?). I drink so many mega-IPAs that they all start to run together unless I drink them back-to-back or even at the same time. So, I decided to really test this out. If I were to pick one IPA as my favorite to the date of drinking this, it would probably be the Stone Ruination. I had one left in the fridge, so I popped it and began to alternate sips. Hands down, the Pliny the Elder was the better beer. The Ruination is definitely drier, heavier, and darker. I dont want to say one is hoppier than the other, because theyre both very well-hopped, but the Pliny is just so much more drinkable and refreshing. I absolutely loved it and would say it is probably my favorite IPA to date, though Id like to try it next to the Green Flash, which I really thought highly of.","Connecticut, USA","sepia5"

I chose to review it (finally) after my girlfriend brought me a 2 liter growler full of it when she had stopped at the brewery on her way back to So. Cal.

The color of this beer is a nice golden/slightly orange straw color with a good head on top.

The smell of this beer is amazing. I would say it is by far the most aromatically pleasing beer Ive come across. Usually a (D)IPA has a pleasing smell, but this is on a whole different level. Its really difficult to describe, but lots of citrus and some mild pine, very floral. The smell of this is better than the taste of many other beers Ive had.

The taste is as you would hope/expect it to be. Lots of hoppy citrusy and bitter goodness. Hardly any malt on this one, but just enough to balance things out on the end. Many times with a really hoppy beer you get a powerful/off-putting aftertaste, but nothing of the sort here.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

The bright, hop-forward flavor chimes in with pine, citrus, and floral notes that tickle the palate.  The smooth malt profile balances the package like no other IPA Ive sampled.  This pour clearly benefited from close-range (50 mile) proximity to the source.  This has to be the gold standard for the style.

Aroma: Immediately hit by an intense floral hop aroma. Further sniffs reveal some citrus (perhaps grapefruit) and pine notes.

Palate: Very smooth, nice carbonation. Super clean aftertaste and mouthfeel, nothing in particular lingers.

Overall: A fantastic beer indeed. I went into this glass a bit hesitant; the intense aroma kind of put me off as I really dont have much taste for heavily hopped brews, but the complex taste and spot on aftertaste had me enjoying sip after sip.

Golden yellow/orange in color. A bit of haziness. A nice white head about a fingers worth. Fluffy and sticky. Sticks to the glass the entire way down.

I picked out some light like citrus in the nose. But it was mostly dominated by a floral like grassy aroma and lots of pine. Very potent nose overall.

At first there is a white grapefruit/ floral flavor followed by a touch of sweetness from the malts. After a second a piney resiny flavor kicks in and pine dominates. Almost like chewing on pine needles. (but in a good way)

Mouthfeel is fabulous. Lots of oily hoppy goodness in the mouth that then turns dry and clean on the swallow leaving you wanting another sip.

Drinkability is perfect. I could sit down and drink this all day long no doubt about it. I can see why Pliny The Elder is held in such such a high regard. It is a wonderfully crafted beer that im lucky enough to have finally gotten my hands and tastebuds on.","Pennsylvania, USA","BigMike"

Two row malts...lots of it, hops, lots of them, and the magical hop extract solution...Thats the beer.

Aroma:very herbal/floral. Hops you can smell and taste before they hit your mouth. This is a big plus!

Appearance:Looks like another other beer...clear, slightly golden hue.  I dont think this category does anything to describe the bear. I gave it a three because it looks like any other craft beer. 

Palate:Rough...hoppy astringent bite. Leaves a long acidic touch to the back of the throat. Hop heads are addicted to it for that very reason. I find the hops and alcohol to be unbalanced and harsh.

Overall its a fine IPA but its overall build to me is highly one dimensional. Do be warned. The bottles of Pliny are not as good as the draft versions. And draft versions vary from batch to batch.

Some batches of Pliny have a lot more balanced malt/hop than others. I suspect that the unstable nature of hops is why it can vary batch to batch. If you are a die hard hop head then the portable pliny bottle will make your out of state travels better :)

Okay, Ive not detected hops evil cousin in the nose of a beer before, but this one is it. This smells like some mighty fine weed! If I thought that I could dry this out and smoke it, Id try to. Very green and earthy smelling. Pine resin and grapefruit, with a hint of citrus, mostly orange. Nice floral presence. This has got to be one of the best/nicest smelling DIPA/IIPAs that Ive ever had.

Wow, the taste is much smoother than expected. Based on the hype and the nose, I expected to pucker-up with this one. Not the case, at all. Very nice citrus/floral balance, here. 
Sure, there are a ton of hops in this. There is also a nice balance provided by a nice bed of dry malt flavor.
A good grapefruit showing mixed with tangerine sweetness and the zest of pine needles. A good counter balance of caramel malt sweetness. Excellent balance. No bitterness, no over-the-top sweetness.

Very nice. Truly a crisp, clean brew. Light and refreshing. Just slightly too thin for me to rate it a perfect 5.0, though. 4.5 is pretty close.

I could drink this by the barrel-full. Although, Id probably choose something that was bigger, thicker, and maltier. Thats the only reason it misses the 5.0 rating on drinkability. Just personal preference.
Overall, I must say that I am impressed. This one truly lives up to the hype.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

Wow, this is almost all bitter, there is a slight sweet carmel malt but it is cut SHARPLY by a strong hop profile.  Very dry pine and resiny hop oil cooked on the stove and reduced down to make it more pure and strong then added back into the beer to make the hoppiness more than anyone could handle.  But in all actuality, its quite good, and after the first few sips getting that bitterness on the tongue, it settles into a fine brew.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","fata2683"

S: Oh yeah, now thats a strong-smelling IPA! Average hops (actually not overpowering at all) that are very perfumed, with citrus, pine, cut grass, and celery coming through. The pine in particular is quite strong.

T: This is a damned smooth-drinking beer. Of course the hops are present throughout the whole time, but the finish is much milder than I would have expected from that powerful aroma. Pine and citrus are very present and in your face, but they dont push their luck. 8% ABV? I would never have guessed that high.

M: One of the smoothest, creamiest beers Ive had, with a perfect balance of soft-average carbonation with the full-body.

Appearance : Clear yellow small foamy white head. Some lacing but not that much.

Aroma : Big leafy and floral hops with lots of malt and some spices. Very fruity with notes of mangos, pinneaple and passion fruits. Complex notes of cereals on the nose with light honeyed notes. 

Taste : Lots of malt with fruity hops. Floral and a bit spicy. Finish is quite bitter with lots of malt and some spices. Carbonation is delightfully soft. Alcohol pretty much absent.

Overall : Always a nice one to have. Malt of gorgeous and mixes really well with the fruity hops. Bitterness is sharp and rather intense but this is still quite drinkable... almost quaffable thanks to the softness of the carbonation. Biggest modification os this rating is palate going from 3 to 5. Dont know why I never noticed the awesomeness of the palate in this beer. Had the first can of Heady Topper a week ago and I think PtE is better. Lets wait a while for Alchemist to tune up everything before making a final call !

Bottle thanks to glouglou. Pours pale amber with a small head. Long retention. Nice lacing. Nose is floral hops, some grapefruit, a bit citrusy. Taste is floral hops. Not so bitter. Quite dry. Finish is bitter. Some hints of fruits. Very drinkable and sessionable. Very good beer. Really need to try this one again.

Taste is hop centric, with a nice bitter bite on the finish that I find myself missing in other, ""smoother"" hop bombs. 20 minutes later -- like all great IPAs, this one has brutalized my palate thoroughly, and now, in the final pleased sip, it is honey sweet, with a bitter kiss.

Thanks to a friend for sending this along with some other West coast specialties.  Knowing that it would only decline with time I cracked it open at the first available opportunity.  My reward was one of the best double IPAs I have tried.  I know this will move to the top of my list whenever I can try it on tap.

Aroma / Appearance - The reddish orange body surged with carbonation like air bubbles escaping through a pile of raked leaves just fallen from the trees.  Peach, grapefruit, and mango bring me to a tropical island far from the chilly fall weather.  Crisp and distinct it leaves little to the imagination.

Flavor / Palate - Hoppy from the first time it touches the lip this fills the mouth with sweet and bitter aspects.  Peach, mangoes, and straw converge before a dry finish not unlike a tart champagne.  I would not sit on this long; if you have a long queue bump it to the front immediately.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

285,"2009-10-07",4.0,"Bottle thanks to scrizzz. Thanks Clint! Pours clear golden orange with a big frothy white head, leaving loads of sticky lacing all along the glass. The head itself fades to a ring. Aroma is surprisingly mellow. Perhaps its too cold still. Picking up notes of mango, pineapple, citrus, very fruity. Not a lot of malt to back it up in the nose, some brown sugar/caramel. The same notes return in the flavour, along with a big pine resin and citric finish, drying up the palate for a second before the spit starts rushing back in for a new sip. Carbonation is prickly and refreshing. At this point, I am somewhat disappointed. Dont get me wrong, its a very good beer. Thing is, my expecations were fairly high, due to the high rating, and I dont think its better than a fresh NØ dIPA or Ægir IPA. It was bottled in mid august, so obviously its not that old either.

285,"2009-09-23",4.5,"Pliny just might be my favorite beer. At the very least it holds a place in the pantheon of my favorite beers. If you could bottle grapefruit flowers and then drink that bottle of grapefruit flowers and it got you drunk youd have Pliny the Elder. My favorite part about the beer just might be how pale it is. Barely a hint of orange in a mostly yellow canvas. Upon gazing at its skinny hay color one could mistake it for the hair color of the girl who lived down the street, at the end of the summer, whos days were spent in the sun. Then you taste the beer and it turns out shes not only cute but smart too. That being said, I would expect this beer to be darker; not a big deal, just saying. 

My only knock on Pliny is that sometimes the batches can be inconsistent. The best batch of Pliny is my desert island beer; but to someone as accustomed to it as I am, when you get a bad batch its a little disappointing. However, the worst batch of Pliny Ive ever had is still better than 90% of the beers Ive ever tasted. Great beer, just get one.

285,"2009-09-18",4.6,"First off, a big thanks to my cousin for bringing this beer with him to OH on a x-country trip from CA.

Ive had this beer at festivals on draft, and thought it was amazing.  However, I usually dont rate from samples, so I havent rated it until I got my own bottle.  And while the bottle was very good, I dont think it was as fresh as the samples Ive had on draft.  Because while the bottle I got was certainly very good, it wasnt the hop ecstasy I experienced in the draft form.  So, in this review, Ill likely split the difference.

Color is far lighter than I wouldve expected.  It looks like a golden ale - not too thick, a very light blond/golden color, with a nice amount of head piled on top - a nice picture.  Aroma was very hoppy (but hoppier on draft) and was very pine-y and resin-y.  Beer was balanced with a nice malt framework...even though this beer is packed with hops, it didnt unbalanced.

Mouthfeel is light and pleasant.  I swear I could drink a gallon of this stuff without feeling stuffed and like my mouth was coated with cotton candy (the way I would feel with other very hoppy, sticky IPAs).

285,"2009-09-14",3.1,"I love everything about this beer except for the completely over the top hopping. Its true that they did it right by balancing things with a hefty malt backbone to support and offset the hops, and at least being advertised as an imperial IPA forewarns, but I dont think getting cottonmouth from a beer is necessarily pleasant. I love hops, but theres such a thing as ""too much""","USA","bkjones"
285,"2009-09-13",4.6,"500 ml bottle, bottled on 8/19/2009.  Pours a beautiful yellow-gold.  The medium head is thick, creamy and laces well on the glass.  The aroma alone is reason enough to buy this beer.  Huge, fresh pine is the first note, followed by layers of citrus.  Just when I think it cant get any better  I take a sip and am rewarded with a wonderful balance of citrus and resiny, piney hops.  So many bold tastes and sensations going on that it could easily overwhelm and miss the mark, but instead it takes me to the zenith and holds me there.  Ive had the great fortune of enjoying this beer a number of times before, and every time I do its like falling in love all over again.

285,"2009-09-08",4.7,"Location: 500 ml bottle via trade with NickD717, 9/8/09 I have been looking forward to this one since it arrived in the mail, and it lived up to the expectations.


Aroma: Wonderful aroma of citrus hops, peach, pine hops, hops, some mild caramel thanks to the nose, right off the bat I can tell this beer is going to be wonderful.

Appearance: Pours a nice hazy bright orange color, with a wispy white head, and retains some nice, almost uniform, spotty lace on the glass.

Flavor: I thought that nose would be hard to live up to, well it does, great hoppy flavor, some nice peach, pine, and just a little caramel/bread malts for ""balance.""

Palate: Really nice palate as well, smooth and easy to drink.  Giving this a 5 over a 4 purely because of the absurd drinkability, I could drink this constantly. 

Overall Impression:
Im jealous of everyone who gets to drink this stuff regularly, I kind of want to move to the West Coast just so I can drink more Pliny!  I cant even imagine how good the Younger must be.  Seriously Nick, you are one lucky bastard for living so close to these guys, color me jealous!  I could probably rant about this beer for hours, and I can see why people call Russian River the best IPA brewery (after having only this and Blind Pig, I might be inclined to agree).  Wow, I have certainly found a new beer to add to my favorite list, that is for sure.  Heres the ultimate compliment: my glass is almost empty, and it is actually making me sad that I cant just pop another one of these. I look forward to seeing ""Ben has a new Top 10 beer..."" next to my rating for the next few days, with regards to this beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

285,"2009-08-27",4.6,"Bottle, shared with hobbersr and macadem. Pours a surprisingly pale gold for a IIPA, not a thick head, but a persistent ring. Laces like anything, Crazy Sheeting Action! The beer is the aroma of a pine forest in mid-April, just as the sap is starting to flow, and the earth is beginning to awaken from natures bitter kiss of winter. Needle, bark, limb, and bough, this beer expresses every essence and subtlety of this impossibly perfect moment in early spring. Then this melody of aroma becomes a seraphic chorus as grapefruit, ginger, the gentlest whisper of malt, and a merest hint of mint add their voices to the swelling  tide of near-perfect aromas that waft from the glass. Spruce, juniper, pine and cedar each have their 3 minutes of fame as the beer warms, each expresses itself individually and beautifully, with seamless transition. Man has arrived in the forest. The palate is bracing, immediately resinous, sappy, sticky, my mouth feels sticky, instinctively I check my fingers, find my brain arguing against my fingertips that they MUST be sticky. Sharp, clear, piercing, but it immediately leaves you desirous of more. Though the aroma promises aetherial, unearthly ambrosia, the flavours remain firmly rooted to the earth.

Citrus fruits, especially grapefruit and herbal piney hops. The hops really stay in control though, which seems so hard to find these days with all the hop nukes around. Really doesnt linger much in the throat, but you know you drank it, especially if you feel the need to belch.

Maybe I hyped this beer up a little too much in my mind.  I was really expecting a knock-out, but I didnt get it.  Dont get me wrong....this was a great beer.  But it missed the mark of all the talk and hype leading up to it.  But it didnt miss by much.  This is still a fantastic beer.  It poured a clear and sparkling dark golden color with a very generous off-white head.  There was much lacing left around the glass, as well.  The aroma was rich and full of hops, flowers, cumin, chili powder, toasted bread and earth.  The body was silky smooth and completely drinkable.  The flavors were profound and balanced, with rich notes of bread and malt, along with the tang and bitter tones of hops, grapefruit, orange peel and red pepper.  The finish was quite bitter, hoppy and spicy, but was balanced with tones of bread and malt.  This was defintely was a great beer; one that I drove through a very severe thunderstrom, with heavy rain, hail and lightning to taste.  I was a little disappointed, but quite satisfied.

Cheers Craig, without you, I wouldnt have had this beer.  Craig is becoming one of the best traders in the UK.  The beer is gold orange with a lasting white head, that keeps its condition.  Very piney hops on the aroma.  Some almost meaty pate.  Piney leafy grapefruit.  Great aroma, but not the best ever so a 9 I think here, because the piney hops are good, but maybe not quite fresh leafy enough for a 10.  God this is hard, as Ive had some delicious flavours in my mouth so far today.  Almost salty resiny piney in the mouth.  God the finish is huge.  I mean huge.  What an assault of hops.  Glad Im sat down or would have fallen down.  Aroma and finish are amazing, but the middle does go a bit walkabout.  Some toffee, but not a huge amount of malt to back up the hops.  Drinkable, but I think a little lacking in structure in the mouth.  I mean I am being really picky here.  Most beers I wouldnt worry about, but this deserves my full concentration.  Start and finish are brilliant, straight off one of the best beers Ive had.  And itll get a very very good score.  But this is going up against some of my favourite beers, and this is where its going, so Im now comparing this to the top 20 beers Ive had.  Yes, I love it, but it doesnt quite stir the passion of some others.  Mind you that, finish does reach down to my groin and rips my balls back up through my throat.  Now it just comes down to a holistic feel about the beer.  And this is where it becomes difficult, splitting the reputation, the difficulty in getting it, from the beer itself.  What if Id never heard of it and just drank it?  Well, as a beer it is still incredibly good.  The aroma of piney hops, the drinkability in the mouth and the finish is just about  the best Ive had.  Maybe just a bit too soft in the mouth.  But this really is gorgeous.  The very top echelon?

This is just one awesome beer.  Has a medium body.  I would drink this anytime anywhere I love this beer.","Perkasie, Pennsylvania, USA","Birdiebeagle"

Mmmm, so good.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"

Nice aroma which smells like piney hops more than citrus... maybe Im wrong on that. Thin mouthfeel which I wasnt a huge fan of, but the overall flavor is great. Nice mild bitterness, that isnt too biting but you definitely know there was a heavy dosage of hops.

Thanks to Joey from South Bay Drugs for keeping this in stock concurrent with our Coronado family trip-poured into Coronado Brewing pint glass...

Golden honey body with sparse visible carbonation and ample head with nice texture and lacing.

Of course I can smell the hops without trying. Very sweet, oily, bountiful hop aroma with velvety caramel malt backbone. Faint alcohol serves as a binder (or a catalyst). Cant get better than this.

Of course the floral hops dominate but theres a malt nuttiness-almost peanut brittle-that mixes with the mild alcohol essence to create beautiful chemistry.

Deep, well balanced yet hop-bitter citrus grapefruit puckering finish mellowed well by velvety caramel malt. First pour could use a little more carbonation to bring out all elements but warmth takes care of this.

Abundant fresh green hop flavor, very lively and pungent, just a light malt backdrop. But then a husky hop pellet flavor begins to show up, and a lot of the magic is tainted. Not at all too bitter, just that horse-feed sack quality of lots of pellets that just really distracts from the pleasure of the flower thing, which had been going so well.

The hops just seem to romace every over flavour.... Somehow the finish remains smooth and lingering without being predominantly bitter.

 Re-Rate Nov5, 2009 - So, I pretty much dont pass up Pliny when I see it at home, but the best I can do is about 4 weeks old. Picked up a couple today in Socal @ 2 weeks so thought Id add a re-rate. The dank, resinous, sticky profile is SO much more pronounced in just that short of a time difference. Oily and deep citus pervades the first sip, with JUST enough malt to spread the grapefruit, lemon and pineapple flavors out. Bitter, dry (?) finish that makes me so want more. This beer, this fresh, has no equal for me. Slight uptick in rating as the aroma and overall effect are just that much better @ only 2 weeks old - next step - days old from the brewery (10,5,9,5,19)","Littleton, Colorado, USA","alagnak"

Well balanced throughout start to finish!  Clean hop flavor is citrusy and grassy, green/recently harvested if you will.  Toasty malt takes a back seat, but its there and well represented.  Caramel is also there, but in the background.  Finish is on the dry side and most definitely clean, grassy and citrusy hop flavored.  Medium bodied, smooth m/f, dry @ the finish, but very clean palate.  I can see why this is highly rated!

285,"2009-06-04",4.5,"Appearance  This is definitely one of the best looking DIPAs I have ever seen. Pours a yellowish orange color with a large billowing white head that only has small traces of tan in it. As the head slowly recedes it leaves lacing that every DIPA should strive for; absolutely beautiful.

Smell  Hops, hops, hops, and hops. This smells like if there were any malt in it, the hops already took the malt out back and beat the crap out of it. Good job hops! Very piney and floral with just a hint of citrus. The malt gives a little bit of a caramel scent rounding it out at the end, but in no way dominates this hop bomb in any way, shape, or form.

Taste  This has a hop zing to it that isnt overbearing but it lasts the test of time. It lets you know that the hops in this sucker are here to stay and will kick your ass just like they did the malt. It has a very strong piney taste to it. After the pine settles down a little bit the tangerines and grapefruit come out to play and they do it well. After all is said and done the malt is still struggling to make an appearance, but those hops are just relentless.

Mouthfeel  This alone makes me want to take gulp after gulp of this amazing DIPA. Thick and resinous with lasting appealing. It feels like it envelopes your tongue like it just took it hostage. 

Drinkability  I would drink this daily if I could. Russian River really knows what they are doing when it comes to just about any style. Well played RR, well played.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

Pours a dark copper-y color and the aroma had wafts of citrus (namely grapefruit), and some floral notes as well. Under those aromas were some pine and overall goodness.  As mentioned in prior posts, despite the all hop aroma all the time and the BIG hop taste, it didnt have the bitterness that sometimes a hop-bomb can have.

RERATE: Freshness it key to this beer. Got it fresh of the shelf on the day it arrived in colorado. All I can say is if Im getting this one at about a month old or older and it tastes like this, I may be moving to Cali soon. Truely the best IIPA out there IMO.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","tilldeath"
285,"2009-05-23",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2010 500mL bottle from Beerstore.co.nz , bottled on 23.01.09. Let him warm up for a couple of hours out of the fridge. Cheers beerstore!! Pours hazy dark golden with a filmy off white head. 


Aroma is full of those beautiful piny American hops and citrus fruit. I get some orange peel, yet the malt gets through, caramel poking its nose in.

Wow, the beer is highly drinkable yet the flavours are very pronounced. Resinous hops coat the mouth with a medium to strong bitterness which brings the pine flavour. Behind this cloying hop is a somewhat robust malt, which sweetens the deal and makes for a very balanced beer. Hops turn citric on the finish, probably like orange rind – very bitter. The finish is very long, as one would expect with an uber hoppy beer.

All together a strong beer for sure, in its flavour. The 8% ABV doesn’t show itself, in fact I’d liken this strongly to its smaller brother ‘Blind Pig’, yet more balanced. Woooow, a dangerously delicious beer.","Wellington, New Zealand, NEW ZEALAND","donfardz64"

Flavor is pretty mellow, with grapefruit hops being the main flavor with a mild bitter finish. I was a bit disappointed with this one though, because I thought the hop flavor was too mild..in that the hops werent prevalent enough.

Still pretty well hopped, bitter flavor with grapefruit, flowers and moderate sweetness, very nice lingering bitterness, pretty strong seedyness. Almost full bodied, lovely smooth palate.

This pours a bright, clear orangey copper with a white head fading to a lasting ring of lace. aroma is all about the hops, plenty of citrus and pine, this jumps out at you every sip. Mouth watering, The flavor is outstanding with sweet, juicy citrus leading the way and some piney notes as well,  all the hop flavors came out without being the least bit bitter. Finished and after taste linger gently making you want more. This is  truly one of the best IIPAs Ive had.

Fruity finish w. more of that mint, strong but incredibly well rounded bitterness, tangerine.  Great lower carbonation level.  Not as amazing in the bottle as it was on tap (I always forgot to rate it when I was in San Diego - but Id imagine that what I had on tap a few times was a 4.5) but Id kill to have this available at the current cost.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"

Very vinous, like the hops were just picked and youre burying your nose in a pile of them.  Some tangerine and caramel malt.  The taste is hugely bitter... and... hmmm... nothing.  Damn near nothing, at least.  There was some malt backbone, but not enough to even hint at sweetness.  Honestly, it was like alcoholic hop tea that was bitter as hell.  No hop flavor at all.  Disappointing as hell.  I have another bottle and hope this was just an off one.  8/4/6/2/14

The mouthfeel is creamy, sticky, and thick, with a bitter finish.  The second pour, was hazy, but still light orange with a larger head.

Taste is out of this world. Perfectly crafted, perfectly balanced, not too bitter, but the hops are put on a pedestal on this one. Slight hints of grapefruit.

Mouthfeel is great, it sticks to your lips just slightly, carbonated perfectly so it bubbles all over your tongue. Not too heavy to make it hard to drink, but not too light that the flavor leaves. The taste of this one lingers for a while.","San Diego, California, USA","tokyogoat"

The finish was dry with a prolonged bitterness.  Very nice.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
285,"2009-05-04",4.6,"Very seductive DIPA.  Pours a peachy amber to golden color with white head that starts thick and dissipates to a thin layer that lasts well.  Lace is present.

Nose is the best feature of this ale.  I get an appetizing tropical fruit, and perhaps we could call it candied tropical fruit like in those tropical versions of trail mix, where you might get some coconut thrown in for good measure.  Im also picking up something that is in the direction of mango with pineapple.

Taste is grassy and dry up front, with a reflexive mouth pucker from the hops leaping across the palate.  Not a lot of malt here, and the alcohol is amazingly subdued.

The big hop aroma exploded from the moment I opened the bottle - citrus, citrus and more citrus - but pine and grass also, and a touch of chocolate from the malt. Drinking it, the palate is so smooth, despite the hop bitterness. At first you get all that piney and citrusy flavour - getting more of the malt in the swallow - and even in the finish, which has peppery hops but surprisingly not too bitter.

285,"2009-04-28",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2009 50cl bottle at home: Pours a nice crisp yellow gold with a diminishing, tall and somewhat creamy yellowed head. Great citrussy hop aroma. Definite grapefruit, apricot, and even some slight peach. Pine notes are also present but they are under the citrus fruit. Sweet malt that is almost sugary when combined with the citrus is big enough to balance the hops (balance in an IIPA kinda way). Light caramel drizzled over the top. A touch of alcohol makes that peach note seem like peach schnapps. Flavor is obviously dominated by hops, but there is a initial flash of pale malts before the hops roll in and conquer your tastebuds. Big piney hop fights with big grapefruity hop. Malt is less balancing than in the aroma but it is still gives a backbone to the hops. Although, it seems more like simple sugars at times rather than a nice complex malt profile. Medium body. Low alcohol drives some astringency and light burn into the back of your throat. Hops get a light mint edge towards the end. Long hop finish (duh!) that gets a little spicy and more fruity than what was noticed earlier. Resiny burn builds after all that.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

Flavor is nice: Initially sharp grapefruity hops and then the fruit again. Aroma and flavor are very similar, though the flavor I found pretty creamy for an IPA and this added another dimension to it which I thoroughly enjoyed. Just the slightest of alcohol burns in the esophagus. Mouthfeel is quite nice, very appropriate for the style; Good carbonation level without being soda-pop. Very high quality all-around.

The aroma is very nice of orange and grapefruit hops with some lemon zest over a sweet, pale malt backbone. The flavor follows with the citrus and resiny piney hops pushing forward with subtle orange and lemon flavor. The toasted caramel malt lends a nice balance, but doesnt overpower the hops. This one is not overly complex, but straight forward and well blended. Medium bodied and fairly smooth and easy to drink with a solid hop bitterness on the finish.

After several hundred others, this one still stands up as one of my favorites. It has a one of a kind floral, foresty, citric nose with an amazing, frothy off white head. The flavor is very sophisticated with sweet jasmine, melon, and grapefruit. The sweet fruit flavors balance out the florals pretty admirably, but eventually you give in to the massive pine bitterness. I love that.

The flavor is amazingly well balanced. The hops are prominent, of course, with an initial sweetness that is unexpected. Thats followed by a substantial bitterness that clings to the inside of the cheeks and then pleasantly subsides. All of the flavors are in harmony - making this a truly exceptional beer.

285,"2009-04-01",4.2,"Bottle.  
Average, though not bad, on the appearance.  Light straw yellow pour with a small-ish head that laces the heck out of the glass.
Nose is a slightly muted mix of bitter, stiky citrus and tropical fruit over top of an earthy fruity sweetness.
Flavor starts with a hefty slap of bitterness, though not as aggressive as one might expect.  Hop profile shines through immediately- dominant sharp, crisp citrus with loads of grapefruit and lemons.  Dank, earthy resinous notes blend in as well.  Some light sugar cookie malt sweetness balances nicely with the fruit notes on the back end.
Palate lacks some of the dry crispness one might have hoped for, with some lingering semi-oily sweetness, though not enough to detract.
Overall very good DIPA- maybe not the best around, but certainly one of the better examples.","framingham, Massachusetts, USA","twitcher"

Aroma is hugely citrusy and piney, with fresh pineapple, grapefruit, and sweet tangerine.  The flavor here is actually substantially more subdued than the aroma, but no less special.  Some nice upfront lemonade flavors, fragrant soap, and mild honey.  Middle flavors bring on more hop characteristics, perhaps even of floral varietals.  Finish lingers teasingly, with tart/acidic notes, full of grapefruit, still well balanced.  Palate is light on the tongue, just dancing around with flavor.  Finish is appropriately dry.

This really was an incredible nose that was almost perfect. The taste is lovely though just a tad after the lord mayors show when compared to the aroma.

Im finding myself rather indifferent towards the mouthfeel.

285,"2009-03-24",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2009 The famous Pliny the Elder has made it to little old New Zealand. Thaks BIG TIME to Mike Neilson for his efforts. Everyone else here has described this beer to death, so Ill just give some impressions. Firstly, I was actually a little disappointed, but then it was a huge buildup. Nothing was ever going to live up to the hype. That out of the way, this is a great beer. I cant believe its 8% abv. Silky smooth, medium carbonation, very quaffable. The hops are prominent, but its really the malt which makes the biggest impression. Barley sugars, fresh baked ciabatta bread, and a hint of malt biscuits. After that (and before really, via the aroma) the hops are there. Lemon, grapefruit, lime, pine needles, and a sharply herbal flavour, like cilantro but not quite. This beer is certainly an experience. Please sir, may I have another?

The aroma is maltier than usually for the style, but however is highly hoppy with notes of pine, grapefruit, oranges. Leafy too. The flavour has a medium sweetness and some acidity. Again enough malty, lightly bready and herbal and citric hops. So, quite balanced for the style. Medium body, lively carbonation, dry long finish with medium to high bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel and alcohol well hidden. Not the best appearence and maybe not big bodied as I expect in a DIPA, but apart this, really good.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

285,"2009-03-22",4.4,"500ml bottle. Pours a golden orange body with a light haze. Finger-width, pure white, foamy head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a good deal of delicate lacing. Aroma of bright, fresh, juicy citrus and big, robust caramels. Very similar to the Blind Pig, but more orange peel and much fuller malt profile. Not quite as assertive on the nose, but still very nice and full. Light amounts of pine, but again...the malts are more pronounced and dont allow the big hop profile to become too sharp. Flavor is a very well balanced DIPA. Lots of orange as well as some tropical fruits mix their way in nicely with the big, sweet caramel malts. Slippery finish before slowly drying and leaving a sugary citrus linger. Not the extreme hop aftertaste that the Blind Pig offers, but much sweeter and balanced. There is a light zest and pine throughout, but I cant stress how well balanced this is. The palate is light to medium, but very clean and smooth. Overall, this is living up to the hype. Clearly the juiciest and most well balanced CA brew Ive tried recently. It is loaded with fresh citrus and a big malt profile, but stays relatively mellow throughout while maintaining extreme floral qualities. Very well done.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Light hazy dark amber clour with solid white head. Aroma is heavy from the hops, there is plenty of grapefruit and oranges along with bit of pine. Flavour is loaded with hoppy grape-juice and its very clean overall. There is vanilla ice-cream, pink grapes, gooseberries and oranges. The hop bitterness, that is said to be monstrously high, is sensed early and last all the way from sippin till long after. The malt sweetness is there, yet due to the well attenuation and a low starting gravity, this is a pretty dry beer and very balanced at that. Solid 2IPA!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"

The taste does not disappoint either. For a hop lover this beer is great. The bitter hoppy taste and citrus on the tongue and all through my mouth make this a very drinkable beer but at around 8% it is dangerous to put down and not have another. You can definitely taste the hops in your mouth long after the beer has gone down your throat as if you are sucking on a pine cone.

Pint from draft at the Falling Rock. Ive had this a few times again around town and a nice fresh bottle while I was in San Diego. Its a great double IPA. I feel like with all the hype it gets, all I can think of is how it measures up to others in the style. Its not lacking in hop character and I find it to be amazingly drinkable for the style.

285,"2009-02-01",4.9,"In short: An archetypical IPA that brings together all that is good about American IIPA.  One of the best American hop fix.  Second only to Masala Mama (imho).
How: Bottles.  Many times from many people (Hophead84, Kegbear, more).  Thanks a millon to you all and keep these coming!!!  Always consumed fresh immediately upon reception.
The look: Glowing dark orange body topped by a medium white head
In long: Nose brings oranges, foresty notes, citrus notes, grapefruits notes, resinous elements.  Basically this beer smells like a resume of the all-in-one American (I)IPA.  At first I was surprised at how soft the body and carbonation were with its soft airy bubbles and soft velvety body but the more I drank it the more fitting I thought it was.  All the fruity elements of the nose are present in the taste but the foresty character takes over in the finish with a tasty pine-tree bitterness.  Nice fruity caramel.  The beer has a pleasant dryness with a little dry orange peels and sawdust sensation.  A very tasty brew but unlike many top-rated IIPA this one focuses on high drinkability more than intensity.  No alcohol apparent, drinks like a like 5% IPA.  Definitely in my Top-5 IPA/IIPA.  Ok now for the first time in my life I have respect for the Elder.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Pours hazy, pale gold with a two inch head of porous white. A few dots and streaks cling to the glass after the retreat, and a partial skim coat remained.

Aromatics are a pungent blend of fruit, pine, alcohol, and malt.
Spruce bark, peach skins, mango pulp, orange zest, and sugar-dusted grapefruit.
Mild malt notes mingle with a slight alcohol waft.

On the chewy side of medium bodied, with a sticky, almost sappy mouthfeel. Still very dry and crisp though.

Bitter citrus fruits and light malt lead off the pallet. Grapefruit, pine resin, orange rind, and mangoe pit.
Somewhat earthy and leafy, with a persisting, drying bitterness.
A grapefruit at the foot of a pine tree.

Finishes with some warming alcohol stepping through the lupulus, and lingering, drying bitter citrus.

Incredibly drinkable and very dry. The biiterness is right at the threshold of cutting back on the drinkability. 
Great to see this fine brew in bottles.

Golden yellow with a fluffy off-white head. Flavor is again bursting with hops, orangey pine. Amazingly the malt still balances and t is not over the top.

285,"2009-01-07",4.4,"500ml Bottle.  Pliny pours out straw colored with no head at all.  Aroma is noticeable even as the beer is being poured. The nose on this beer is as impressive as any Imperial IPA Ive ever tried. Heavy floral citrus that blows you away initially and is still present at the end. I would guess that it has a bit of Amarillo in there. I dont notice as much pine in the nose as others who have rated this one. Flavor really allows the hops to shine as the subtle undercurrent of caramel malt doesnt detract from the beer or make it overly sweet.  Bitterness is present, but not overpowering the way the nose would lead you to believe. Body is on the thin side with a very mild carbonation which again is perfect for a beer intent on showcasing the flavor of hops. Finishes dry with a lingering bitterness.

The aroma is the finest part of the beer, mostly fruity (apple, grape, grapefruit and other citrus) and piney hops with some floral notes.

285,"2008-12-31",4.0,"Ive had Pliny the Elder twice before now.  Both occasions were at successive GABFs, and while it may have been the agony of an overwrought tongue or the sensory overload from so many scents, screams and suds, I didnt like Pliny the Elder at all.  Both times.  It didnt seem like anything special - just another battering ram for hops.  When I returned to Colorado this holiday visit to see the family I noticed that Russian River was distributing Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder and Damnation.  Of course, the memories of Pliny werent particularly glowing, but I thought it only fair to give it another chance, straight from the bottle, and toped in a low-key, quiet environment.  Sitting down even.  And miraculously it became a whole different breed of beer.  Theres absolutely no head, the Pliny a clean shaven brew except for a decorative wreath of white bubbles.  A sweet, rich and gripping aroma slinks out from the glass, dripping with honey, floral notes and enticing me to take a sip.  I cant remember an IPA doing this before, and with such a soft touch.  Typically I enjoy Imperial IPAs, but only because they really knock you around with sugar and hops.  But this was so restrained I thought it was a regular IPA.  The palate strikes me as a bit loose, with rich flavors like these usually accompanied by a more syrupy vehicle.  The sweetness remains in the flavor, but only under a thicker layer of bitter but savory hops bitterness.  Not too much grapefruit in the eye, but just enough to tickle the tongue.  The flora aspect is weighed beautifully against the other flavors, and generally the whole brew seems like it was meticulously measured and engineered to insure that no flavor element is louder than another, and that is poetry.  I still am not, nor will I ever be, enamored with the IPA style or hop bombs, but this has been, to date, the most elegantly brewed specimen of the style Ive had, and Im happy to report it is a far greater beer than it was in the past.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Smell - Piney, citrus/grapefruit, floral & hoppy. Smells like one would after frolicking in a field of hops.

Palate - Great mouthfeel on this one... Crisp and light going down with medium carbonation and effervescence.

Drinkability - Zoinks scoob... this is one tasty beer. 8% you say? Blasphemy! Usually I can not drink but 2-3 IPAs since my palate gets overwhelmed andI am left with a dry hoppy taste in the back of my throut... but this one... I could drink Pliny all night.

285,"2008-11-29",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2010 Draught at the Bistro.   I have long awaited the day to try Pliny the Eder.   Maybe I was expecting too much.   Hype is a horrible thing.   Piney and grapefruit peel-bitter hops are done exquisitely, within a clear golden body topped by a sticky white head.   Aromas of pine needles and flowers.   Light and dry as the most drinkable IPA.   Not like any IIPA that Ive had.   So dry and crisp.   Bitter, endless finish.   I love the dryness and drinkability; its like a single IPA that manages double the hop load, but The hop profile still falls a bit short.   Im missing the tropical, fruity notes that I get out of some other west coast IPAs.   Pliny does its thing almost perfectly, but that might just not really be my thing in the absolute realm of the hop.   Rerate:   I get it now.   Forgive me, Pliny, for not even a fiery death at Mount Vesuvius could quell your awesomeness.   The dryness IS the beauty.   I guess it depends whether I am in the mood for a thicker DIPA or a dryer, thinner DIPA, but the power of the hops in this one is outdone by none so far. (4.4)
Rerate:   My first bottled sample, at about three weeks old, as well as draught a couple times in the last two days.   Awesome floral hops in the aroma.   The flavor is so hoppy, yet the bitterness is so soft and inviting.   You really could drink this for a session and not burn your palate out with bitterness or sweetness.   Every sip leaves you longing for another, with a perfectly balanced, dry finish.   Stunning stuff, but the glass I had at the grad showed how much this can drop off if not properly fresh.As a final amendment, Pliny rocks.   Having it at the brewpub last weekend reminded me how amazing it is in both hop profile, and incredible dryness and drinkability.   Younger cant even touch how expressive the hops in Elder are due to the light body and lack of sweetness.   The side-by-side I did a little while back was foolishly with a bottle that just cant compare to having this on tap and the brewpub.   This is pretty much beer nirvana.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

The bottle is a few months old and the label emphasizes to drink it fresh, so that may have something to do with it.  Still a very good IPA.  Would love to try it fresh.

The bottle poured a perfect clear golden liquid, with a good amount of carbonation and a nice little head.  Good lacing with this DIPA too.

The aroma is and flavor are full of pine and citrusy goodness, but to be honest, I feel Blind Pig really have a better aroma and more hop flavor.

Hoppy goodness for sure - loads of pink grapefruit, candied oranges, tangerines, fresh lemon, pine needles, wet grass, floral perfume, fresh roses.  This really runs the spectrum of hop aromatics.  Very nice.  The body starts with a heavy wall of bitterness that is both rindy and filled with deep resin.  A mild caramel maltiness surfaces to offset the bitterness.  The hops continue to dominate with soft orange and apricot juiciness on the tongue.  As the beer continues to warm, the malt middle also continues to develop.  Light notes of butterscotch and honey intermingle with the citrusy hops.  Finishes properly bitter with a good old dose of tongue scraping rind.  A solid example for sure.  If the tap version really is better, I need to come to CA to try it.  This is one of the lower ABV DIPAs that I have tried.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

285,"2008-10-04",4.7,"I approached this beer like you might the most popular television show that you’ve been too cool to even turn on once. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, it’s LOST. ""Yeah I know that everybody I know (whose viewing opinions on electronic media I generally trust) loves the show, but I don’t have time to even bother with caring, much less take on a new television series into my otherwise full viewing schedule."" You’re a good speaker. Let’s move on.
One of your friends hands you the first season of LOST on DVD and makes it apparent that if you don’t watch at least the first episode that you will be offending them. You watch the first episode while making dinner with your girlfriend. Two days later you have watched all 22 hour-long episodes and the two of you are standing outside your friends place at 3 in the morning to see if you can trade him for season 2.
My experience with this beer was exactly like that.
I knew it was highly rated. I got one when I probably shouldn’t have. I drank it with high expectations and didn’t have any complaints. Hours later I was recreating its pine-y smell in my head and wishing I had another one. It had a small taste of apple in the background. The blume was more dense and hung around longer than I expected. The longer I go since I had it, the more I want one again.",", Washington, USA","tomatohead"
285,"2008-10-03",4.3,"500 ml. bottle, bottled on 08/13/08, drunk on 10/03/08, bottle courtesy of CelticBrew - thanks much for this, Jim! Clear gold body under a medium, but very lingering head, and a ropey, adherent lace. As expected, the hops are all over this with citrus and pine predominantly, but a healthy dose of some floral notes as well. However, not to be lost in the aroma are significant malt contributions in the form of toffee and stone fruit. The flavor is a well tuned balance between a light malty sweetness and the typical citrus zest bitterness of Northwest hops. Medium body and carbonation, resinous, but not excessively so, startlingly smooth, and a pleasingly dry palate. This beer arrives with quite a reputation, and it certainly lives up to it. In this increasingly ubiquitous style, it is not the best, but it is right up there.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

Appearance- Orange in color with good clarity, it has a decent head that sticks around for a little while.
Aroma- A very hoppy aroma, smelling of Piney and/or citrusy hops.
Taste- Extremely hoppy. Very heavy bitterness, the hops attack at every level.  I tasted a little sourness from the malt, but it did a decent job at trying to balance the beer.  The high alcohol level is not obvious, but the high hop rate might inhibit the drinkability of this beer.  Not me however, I liked it alot...

Nothing but piney hops and sweet malts, but certainly not a hopbomb, possibly due to the 2 month bottled on date.  It’s quite balanced though, which is enjoyable.

The flavor is a slight step down from the aroma. The orange/grapefruit dominates first, then gives way to pine, the finish sweetens things up slightly, but is mostly defined by a dry, lingering bitterness.

285,"2008-09-26",4.6,"An absolutely splended DIPA. When describing the flavors in this beer it seems like you’re talking about the standard ""by the book"" IPA, but there’s just something different here, it’s just done absolutely perfect. Citrus fruits are obvious, lots of juicy hops, bitter but not the puckering type of bitter - more like a sweet juicy grapefruit and pineapple juice type of bitter. Malt profile is absolutely perfect. Amazing on the Palate, not too thick - definitely not too thin. Looks great. Nice head that does become just a frothy top, but leaves great lacing. Nice sunburst hue. There is only one problem with this beer and it has nothing to do with the beer itself, it’s the age of the beer. You have to drink this one fresh and I mean FRESH. No more then a week or two after bottling. After a couple weeks it becomes a ho-hum beer. The bottle makes it very clear that this beer needs to be drank absolutely fresh so I’m rating this beer based on a perfectly fresh one I had, rather then the... more common (unfortunately) slightly aged one you are likely to find in the stores. Try to get the freshest you can find! It really does make a world of difference with this beer.","Wheat Ridge, Colorado, USA","MrEcted1"

Pours sparkling clear, orange in color, and a head which is off-white, creamy, full, and fluffy; lace is drippy with some lasting ability.  Nose is pleasant for the style with great pink grapefuit notes, light resin, light grass, and faint candied apricots with minimal warmth noticed.  Flavor is bitter throughout with pink grapefruit peaking first but immediately followed by dry grasses, light pine resins, even a floral hint.  Malt notes include dry toast and lightly candied apricots.  Palate is medium, nearly lively, dry, and almost oily.  Finishes very long and bitter with lots of dry grass and some notes of floral and dank.  It was good and definately a hop bomb, but the dryness is a bit much and there are just not the complexities of some of my favorite examples of the style.

The nose hints at massive amounts of citrus, specifically grapefruit, apricots and peach with some oh-so-subtle grassy and resin notes.  Decent so far...immediately upon tasting this I was a bit let down, I was expecting a hop-bomb and got something much less.  The hoppiness is present but not in the blow-my-mind sense and frankly I was a bit disappointed especially considering all the hype around this.

  It is amber with hints of copper, big, creamy, off-white head lasting and slowly shrinking, great rings of even lace.  Tha aroma is mostly muscat grapes with pine, grapefruit, pineapple, honey, overall very fruity and flowery take on IPA.  The taste is predominantly sweet wine, honey, with a lot of pine, grapefruit, hints of bread and grain, especially in the finish, it has firm sweetness under the dominant bitterness, being mostly sweet wine and hops.

Delicious and a very drinkable IIPA. Original Rating: Big thanks to zythum for this one! Pours an orange-golden color with a thin frothy off-white head with some pretty nice retention and lacing. Aroma is lots of hops, especially pine, with some citrus there as well. The hops up front are sticky pine needles with some lemon, honey, and caramel notes. The finishing hops are juicy grapefruit. Crisp, bitter, and dry. This has lots of hops, yes, but what I love about this beer is that it is extremely drinkable. I imagine this will find a spot close to the top of my list.

285,"2008-09-11",4.7,"Russian River Brewing is neither in Russia nor near a river. At least, not that I know of. But that is rather irrelevant when it comes to their amazingly ability to release dazzling beers of near nirvana perfection time and time again. I haven’t had many of their creations yet, but the ones I have been blessed by were nothing short of bliss. Pliny the Elder is no exception.

My Pliny the Elder poured a rich sunshine orange into my glass. An explosion of fluffy foam topped his wise body, fading slowly into a pillow on top which spread out along the edges for extra coverage. Sweet and fresh wet forestry smells immediately tease and caress my nose. Pine needles, sap, and morning dew. a tinge of citrus in the back, but that crisp piney hop profile I adore so much rules Pliny the Elder’s nose. His body is light and rolls across my tastebuds almost as if it were kissing them. His palate is much like his nose, a perfect blend of sweet pine needles, sap, and wet grass. A bit of bitter lemon in the finish. It is a somber parting as I finish the last quaff of my Pliny the Elder and there is no more to follow.

Ive never met a kissable beer before, but Pliny the Elder is my top Imperial IPA and highly kissable. The only shame is that I don’t have regular access to him.

285,"2008-09-07",4.4,"500ml bottle.  Bottled on 073008.  Pours a light golden color, clear (not bottled conditioned??) with a small but firm soapy white head.  Can smell Simcoe hops while I’m pouring this thing.  Oh yeah before I forget 500ml bottles are such a good size.  Quite underrated I think.  Anyways, the beer smells intensely of tropical fruits.  A very pleasing hop combo, just the kind I like.  Simcoe immediately detectable though without any catty qualities that is can have at times.  Resiny, citrus, cantaloupe, melon, orange pulp, grapefuit zest.  Though I would consider this bottle quite fresh I would really love to smell this beer the day after it’s been bottled.  The combination of hops would be orgasmic if the intensity was just dialed up one notch which I think a super super fresh bottle might achieve.  Either way it’s a magnificent aroma.  Flavor is similar to the aroma in terms of the hops.  Cantaloupe and intense melon stickout, a sticky sweetness from the hops though balanced out by a quite substantial dryness.  The beer is quite dry but the fruitiness of the hops counteract that and it lacks astringency.  Very clean finish, very dry.  I can’t really detect any malt characteristics, everything working here, be it the yeast, body, or the malts is all to aid the hops.  Bitterness is present though smooth and not aggressive.  Above all this is an intensely drinkable IIPA and one I could see myself drinking several pints of.  Certainly towards the top of its class and if this were available here I would buy several bottles a week.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Everything they say is true. 

Light gold with a beautiful white head and tons of lacing. This is the IIPA to beat all IIPAs, hands down. Beautiful perfumy nose with some peach and hay, leafy and floral and glorious. This is a rare 10 for aroma. Lovely flavor, totally avoiding the too-much-caramel-malt trap, never sticky or sweet, minimally astringent, just hop-juicy. I love it. The palate is a little hot as the beer warms for its 8%, but thats a minor quibble. Fantastic.

2-month-old bottle: I should have read the label before buying four at the local QFC. Its already losing it. This one is just a good IPA now. Maybe 4.0, but certainly not 4.4. 

Tap: 7/10/09 at Naked City. Ive heard that this loses something on tap compared to fresh in the bottle. Maybe it does, but it still easily made its way into the mid-fours. The aroma is there, the flavor is there, it drinks like 6%. Splendid.
Tap8/09 at Fiddlers. What beer is not Plinys bitch? Tonight, head to head against the very worthy Port Wipeout (quite similar, more apricot in Wipeout, more herbalness in Pliny), Pliny came through as cleaner and better. Wow.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Has a huge nose, lots of citrus, apricot, grapefruit rind, oranges, very pungent floral hop nose. The flavor was also quite citrusy, tended more towards a grapefruit rind bitterness than the resinous hop character exhibited by the nose.

The aroma is piney resiney floral hops with some sweet caramel malt and a little fruitiness.

The flavor is sweet caramel malts initially with a little bright citric fruitiness that is quickly followed by a good sized piney peppery hop bite the lingers in the finish.  This is excellent tasting and pretty well balanced  (a little hop forward, but not a big messy hop bomb).  The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a velvety texture.

Pours a light orange with a thick foamy head.  Aroma of super bitter grassy hops.  Flavor is pretty similar to Blind Pig but with more malt.  Initial sharp hops bite with some citrus and a slight sweetness and light fruitiness on the finish  Pretty tasty although still on the bitter side.
7/4/8/4/16 (3.9/5)

Update 1/31/09.  Bottled on 12/30/08.  Pours a clear light orange with a small bubbly white head.  Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, and bitter grassy hops.  Lots of citrus in the aroma (which I did not detect in the previous bottle).  Flavor is bitter and grassy initially with a sweet, citrusy (lots of orange peel!) finish.  Mostly on the bitter side.  Hop-forward for sure and I really would like to see a little bit stronger malt base in this.  No change in #s just comments!
Update 3/30/09: On tap at Capones. Pours orange with no real head. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, and hops oils (similar to Younger). Flavor lacks the grassy hops I got in the bottled version. More malty and not as fruity as I remember (although more citrus comes out as the beer warms). Nice hop oils. Quite tasty, probably a tie between the tap version and super fresh bottled version. Ironically, the fresher this is, the more malt I get from it, not sure why. Obviously, still a delight.

Update 6/24/09: Apparently Pliny is one of my most updated ratings!  Anyway, I was lucky to get another fresh bottle (4 weeks old) from Naven and it was even more awesome than I remember.

The hops are not overwhelming like you might expect of a impy IPA of this caliber.

Poured a clear golden-copper color with a thick off-white head that slowly diminished to a layer and left decent lacing.  Aroma of moderately resiny, oily hops with some light citrus (grapefruit and orange, predominantly) and a hint of pine.  Light, sweet maltiness with a bit of citrus leads into a earthy hoppiness with a bit of light pine in the finish.  Nice carbonation and a pretty light hoppy bite.

Bitterness is mild and nicely-balanced for the style.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","scoth"
285,"2008-08-22",4.1,"500 ml bottle, dated 073008.  A great hazy apricot color with just  the lightest lacy off white left after the dense initial head dissipated.  Smell is more full and rounded than many sharp IPAs. Great hoppy smell, with fresh green grapes hidden, and alcohol.  Roasted first flavor.  IPA/hoppy sharpness is not shockingly strong and likes the back of my tongue.  It’s not overly sharp, nor is it overly sweet.  It’s hard to describe the dominant taste sensation.  There IS a big taste there, just not comparable to other big IPA flavors I know.  Very interesting.  It definitely sticks to the back of my tongue/throat.  I was hoping for a religious experience, but instead I just really like this, and need to try it a bunch more times to understand it,  I think.  I’m going to give it a rating, but come back and revisit the rating when I drink another, and another...  Later, I mean.  Not tonight.  Hmmmmm.  I do like it a bunch, just not what I was expecting.","San Diego, California, USA","Lagunitasfan"

500 ml bottle purchased at Argonaut Liquors in Denver, Colorado.  Bottled on 083109 marked on the label.  Pour is hazed golden orange with a perfectly formed two inch slightly off white head that falls slowly with think patchy lacing.  Wonderfully inviting beer.  Aroma is present on pour, big dank resin pine citrus hops.  Very natural, soft, rounded and inviting.  The malt is present as well, earthy hay and toasty.  Nice balance.  Taste is big resin hop right away, really grabs the taste buds and goes.  The mango pineapple citrus and pine follow shortly after, in concert with the toasty mineral earthy malt.  The balance and transition of flavors is just superb.  Palate is medium bodied with a nice carbonation, which dries the mouth with a slight bitterness.  Such a clean and drinkable beer - no wonder I keep buying it at every opportunity.  (9,5,9,4,18 - 4.5)

The flavor packs a lot of punch as well.  Completely dry but still very fruity.  Very balanced with a nice malt back.  This stuff is incredibly fruity.  I love the double IPA’s but they always seem to have a harsh bitter alcohol end, but not this.  It’s got all the intense hop character but goes down incredibly smooth and all the alcohol is hidden.

Nose is a fresh and pure serving of wet sticky green hops that are mellowed out and calm unlike some other imperial IPAs on steroidsnot that it is a bad thing to smell an overloaded double IPA.

The carbonation is there, and its fairly thick, but almost feels as if nothing is in your mouth but a burst of flavor. Has yeasty notes of a Belgian saison-style ale, with (obviously) plenty of hops and the malts to counter. Also notes of grapefruit and light brown sugar. Simply wonderful - a near-perfect IIPA.

2008 - On tap at Henrys - I was pretty excited to try this one, but I must admit that I was a bit disappointed.

Wonderful, zesty hop flavor throughout the mouth! Nice and full flavored as well- I just want to swich it throughout my mouth- does not kill the taste buds, just the right amount of hop bite with a sweet, sweet finish. Maybe a bit of damp hop taste as well (funky?)

285,"2008-08-08",3.9,"Finally!  Bottled 07/09/08.  A glassy, bronze hue of orange, and a thin rim of white.  Green hop bitterness forward in the nose, in sagebrush, hemp oil, and lychee rinds.  A sunny orchard warmth of fleshy stone fruits, apricot and nectarine particularly, and a somewhat sugary malt substance of cotton candy and caramel settles in with time.  Careful and composed, clean and soft, and while the fruity character of the hops is always frontal and forceful, it backs in and out of the more typical grapefruit sensation only briefly, and lingers more on those gorgeous stone fruits.  Flavor is an initially aggressive bittersweetness of pinewood and pears, grounded in wildflower honey and doughy pale malt, with a bit of sage butter lingering uncomfortably outside the windows.  The fleshiness of stone and citrus fruits again washes in warmly as the bitterness amends itself to every corner of the mouth, although the oiliness of the hemp and sagebrush bitterness remains present in a greenish smoky cloud. Toward the finish, the hops gather softness in a comfortable floral perfume; a summertime herbal garden. Full palate is slightly sticky and consistently syrupy.  Soft carbonation.  Ending is somewhat short and bittersweet, returning to the greens in a finalizing dirty hop grind.  The balance and calmness of this understated example makes it really quaffable and bright, but the texture never dries out in with the intensity anticipated.  Still, a pretty monumental example as far as craft and care goes.  Thanks Ty!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

It’s earthy, fruity, funky, dank. Wow. Dripping with pine and citrus oils. Plenty of freshly harvested cannabis. Fresh cut wood (pine and oak with a touch of cedar)? Wet grass. Candied oranges. Apricots and mangoes. Behind the woodsiness and sweetness a delicate floral aroma gently emerges... Seriously could smell this and be happy. Thick, oily dark orange pour with a sustained white, frothy head. Palate screams with balanced excessiveness. Oily, juicy and resinous hops. Tropical fruits... mango and pineapple. Slightly woody... chewing on wet oak. Definitely a thick, but not overbearing sweet malt base. Slightly spicy. Shit this is good. Thick and mouth coating body never becomes oily or cloying.

From a bottle: 7/4/8/4/17
Thanks to mwompus on BA for some fresh bottles. Pours a bright, glowing orange with a beige head and sticky lacing all over the glass.  Smell is tons of Pine, grass, floral, grapefruit and also some honey and biscuit malt.  Sort of understated smell really, it just doesnt jump out at you.  The taste is just an extremely smooth blend of pine and grapefruit hops. Ive never had a DIPA go down this easily.  

From a growler: 8/4/8/4/18
Many thanks to ricand for sending me an extremely fresh growler. It pours a golden, straw yellow. With a creamy white head and tons and tons of sticky lace left on the glass. Pine, pine and more pine. Just tons and tons of glorious, dank hoppage. A slight bit of pineapple and grapefruit and maybe the tiniest amount of maltiness. Chewing on pine cones. Not much other hop flavor is coming through and only the slightest bit of malt. Highly unbalanced but it is an amazing hop bomb.  Again, a chewy resinous mouthfeel. Medium bodied with just enough carbonation. So incredibly drinkable. I couldnt detect the ABV at all and just zoomed through the first pint of this one. An exceptional DIPA.","AUSTIN, Texas, USA","thickfreakness"
285,"2008-07-26",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2009 Thanks to session1979 for this one 
Growler poured into a pint glass had a good finger worth of off white head that went to a good thick lace .The body was reddish amber in color and clear 
Growler
The aroma of this brew is mostly fresh hops although not as much as expected The growler was a little more than a week old so that may account for it. The pine and citrius still is there but some caramel malt to the nose as well 

Im on the second glass from the bomber and I will say that the taste is not what I expected from a west coast DIPA the hop bitter was there but it was well balanced with the malts. Almost a little watery not as oily as I would expect either the carbonation was good.  I will have to try a bottle of this one as well to double check this It could be a case of expectations  not living up to reality dont get me wrong the flavors are still great but not as much of a hop bomb as expected 

Ive had two pint glasses already and will finish this growler of this afternoon so the drinkability is just fine by me      
  
Bottle
Revisited this one thanks to the bottle thethrone sent me. This bottle is much better than the growler I received. Clear hazy copper body some small sediment floating in it. Big white head much lace ensues after it goes 

Aromas of big pine and citrus filled the air and my head. Flavors are extremely hoppy and the mouthfeel is nice and oily. Yes I like this beer it is an Incredible DIPA.

285,"2008-07-25",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2008 Bottle from Monument Liqour in Concord, CA. Poured a copper color with a good sized white head. Smelled of citrus and floral hops.

285,"2008-07-21",4.0,"This stuff is annoyingly hard to find. But today I found it. And I am not disappointed. Pours light yellow-brown, with a medium white head. Smells like a barley wine. A bit of hops, but mainly rosemary and pine. There is a nice layer of peaches to offset the bitterness. The hops are stronger in the flavor, and there is a resiny pine flavor as well. A bit of lime. I like my imperial IPAs to have a creamier mouthfeel that this. But overall, this is not bad. Not bad at all.","Berkeley, California, USA","Aquilo"
285,"2008-07-21",4.4,"500mL Bottle. Pours a clear golden amber with a massive two-finger puffy white head that hangs around for ages leaving a wall of lacing all the way around the glass.

Smell absolutely jumps out of the bottle.  Massive, massive hop aroma with huge pine scents up front, like walking into a pine forest.  Grapefruit, oranges, lemons, all kinds of wonderful floral and citrus scents in this one.  World class smell.

Taste is almost as impressive as the smell with citrus hops up front with grapefruit and lemons.  The bready malt backbone shows up a little bit in the middle before the pine blast kicks in to provide a wonderfully bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation that zings the tongue with hop bitterness and sticks on the palate for a while.

This is a world class example of a DIPA and probably the new standard for me.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
285,"2008-07-17",4.3,"Bottled On Date July 10, 2008; Sampled July 17, 2008
A soft pour produces a three-finger thick, light tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is just so expressively pungeant with hop aromatics that just jump out at me as I am pouring this beer.  It sits in my glas with a light amber, copper hue and shows a clear, bright gold hue when held up to the light.  The aroma is just sticky with hop character; huge lychee notes, super ripe apricot, bright tropical fruit notes, candied grapefruit, expansive tangelo and Curacao orange peel are all easily noticeable.  The other side of the hop aroma spectrum lurks just below the fruit notes with herbal notes that are quite floral, some pine that adds some backbone to the aroma and a light, dank, hemp-oil like note that adds just a bit of an edge to this brew.  What I love about the aroma is the focus on the fruity hop notes, but it still has some of the more herbal notes that add a touch of offset and a touch of contrast.  If you really dig for it some cracker-like malt notes are just noticeable underneath all of the dominating hop aromatics.

Aggressively bitter up front, though not overwhelmingly so, this is quite herbal as it first hits the tongue, but becomes redolent of super ripe hop fruit flavors through the middle and finish.  At this point the bitterness kicks in again and a clean, biting hop note lingers on the tongue for quite some time after the beer has left my mouth.  Pine-sap flavors up front yield to tropical fruit notes of lychees, almost pineapple and other fruit flavors of apricot, peach and ripe tangelo.  The explosive up front fruit flavors seem to get scraped from my palate by the aggressive herbal and pine notes that seem to get more pronounced with every sip.  A short respite from the beer seems to accentuate the fruit notes a bit more again, but it is still as if my tongue has been scraped by some very herbal hops that have left a permanent mark.  Still this aggressively herbal hop character (that is definitely riding the edge of being laden with hemp oil) never buries the hop-fruit flavors.  While certainly not light, this is eminently drinkable; not so heavy that it has not business having the letters of IPA on the label; this is my definitive example of what the texture and heft of a double IPA should be.

The aroma of this beer is just so nice; the dominant hop fruit notes are perfectly controlled by the softer herbal hop character.  The flavor is a bit more herbal in balance and is quite scathing in its hop attack.  Still the bitter, sharply herbal hop notes never get out of control, but this beer still makes me feel like my tongue has been abused and scraped raw by the aggressive hop character.  This is most definitely a well constructed brew, and in some aspects this is quite definitive for the style.  A benchmark for the style that I will never get enough of.

Total 4.2, 9/4/9/4/16
Rest a lightly hazy copper color in my glass.  This has an in-your-face orange aroma on it.  An intense hop taste is found here, but it still manages to be quite smooth.  This is a citrusy, grapefruit, nectarlicious hop bomb.  This beer has a tangy zing quality to it, this just zaps my taste buds.  This beer is defined by its over the top hoppiness, yet still manages to by a smooth hop hit.  There are lots of pine notes as well as an equal level of grapefruit notes in this beer.  All in all this is a very well made double IPA, what else can you expect from the guy who is credited with inventing the style.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Then search this out!! You won’t be disappointed. I had this on tap at the brewery and my tasting notes didn’t rate it nearly as high as I have it here. The only thing I can think of is that it was warmer and not as carbonated there, which the bottle was chilled more, which probably concentrates the hop flavor, and certainly feels a lot more carbonated.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

Multi-layered hop aroma waft around a nice malt backbone. Pineapple, apricot, some citrus hop flavor and then a nice drying bitterness wraps it all up. A touch of acidity and nice medium mouthfeel with a nice bit of carbonation that I bet would just increase if out of a bottle or straight from the tap.

Very orange, grapefruit, hell all of the citrus you could find in this aroma with a woody pine in there also. Definitely something to sit and ponder for awhile. Taste has tons of grapefruit dryness with just hints of malt, yet somehow keeps all of this balanced and smooth. I did not feel like this was too over the top at any point (though, my taste buds might have been shredded at this point). Just a classic DIPA.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"

The pour is a clear, shining golden orange color.  A foamy white head leaves soapy, spotty lacing behind.  The nose simply explodes from the glass with striking notes of juicy, fresh-picked oranges, grapefruits, and lemons.  A lightly sweet, pale malt background sets the perfect backdrop for the massive hop profile to do its thing.  The flavor is deliciously juicy, with bitter, resinous citrus and lemongrass hops shining amidst lightly toasted toffee malts.  Theres nothing overly complex going on, but it is so well blended it is incredible.  Medium-full, smooth, slightly sticky body.  This is so incredibly drinkable.  A delicious IIPA that ranks right up there with the best of them.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Flavor is ideal - perfectly balanced hops.  it doesnt scream alcohol or sweetness or hops.  It is mildly delicious and balanced.  The finish is clean and dry.

285,"2008-05-15",5.0,"This is the finest showcase of hops Ive ever experienced.  I only get to say that about one beer and I have no hesitation reserving it for Pliny.  This beer has a wonderful aroma right up front of fresh hop flowers that will make you declare out loud your love for the vine.  This is clearly a distinct experience from other IPAs commonly found in West Coast craft beers.  It has a very complex nose that seems to present a cornucopia of aromas with each approach.  Hints of Citrus, spring flowers, and even a bit of cannabis can be detected.  The texture is thick and as smooth as they come.  It pours a shining golden yellow with beautiful white lace and feels much more like a porter or stout going down than an IPA.   Ive found this pairs VERY well with spicy foods, particularly Hispanic cuisine.  It also pairs amazingly with caramel, as unusual as that may sound.","Oakland, California, USA","HopheadJosh"

Still poured a nice frothy foam with nice lacing despite the handbottlilng.  Sticky flavour with bits of toffee and pine resin.  Wonderful floral aroma that was quite complex in nature.  Some grapefruit, lemon grass and pine.  A bit heavy on the syrup side of things, but the intense amount of bittering hops helped to keep this in check.

Big and bold in all aspects.  Hops create the syrupy sweetness and bold bitterness that has such a lovely grapefruit and pine blend that I could have died and gone to heaven.  Next time Im here Ill order a big glass or a pitcher.  The sampler was amazing, but I was left wanting more of this one in particular.

285,"2008-05-01",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2014 One hell of a birthday gift sent from a friend.  Thanks!   Poured from a 10 day old growler.  I was worried about it holding up and wanted to get to this promptly and was momentarily worried, when I got no PSSSTTT sound when opening the growler.  Poured into a tulip and the head vigorously formed, regardless.  Poured a clear, golden amber color with a rich, incredibly long lasting offwhite head that left huge chunks of frothy lacing.  Smell was huge piney, fruity, grapefruity, citrusy hoppy deliciousness.  Taste is incredibly smooth and clean.  Citrusy fresh hops and a hint of a slighly syrupy body, but still just barely medium to full bodied.  The drinkability on this was phenomenal and the alcohol was hidden perfectly.  Flavor was a touch milder than expected but was still divine and went down like water.  Great double IPA.

2.5 week old bottles rerate in 2014.  
  
Oh my tastes have changed.  Im sick of the DIPAs and even this and Heady topper side by side is no exception.  Citrusy and piny scent.  Slightly dryish taste with pine and grapefruit rind but enough sticky sweetness remains that makes me not want a lot.  Still, seems more attenuated or drier than Heady.  Not impressed.  Would prefer Blind Pig I think as its not as syrupy or boozy.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

If somebody suffocated you with a sack of hops, this would be your dying whiff. Monstrous pine, grapefruit, some sweet citrus, citrus rind, a medley of floral notes.

Flavor contains an outrageous amount of hops, but the blend and balance therein makes this beer special. Never acrid or overpowering, the citrusy flavors stand stable. A perfect amount of doughy caramely malt loiters in this festival of hops.

285,"2007-12-04",4.2,"As per the beer advocate suggestions, I poured this beer into a snifter. It pours a reddish amber color with a white head. The aroma is very pungent with piney and citrusy aromas, but also has a subtle sweet aroma. It reminds me of DFH 90 or 120 minute. The taste makes the distinction between this beer and DFH though. There isnt the high residual sweetness with this beer as there is with the DFH varieties. Also, it isnt as bitter as I expected. It is actually a very balanced beer. I detect a bit of grapefruit in the flavor and a bunch of pine. I am not generally a fan of DIPAs, but this is really good because of the balance.

Amazingly clear, aroma of Americana hops, IPA color. Nice medium body with a dry finish. A little clingy bitter finish, I bet they use pellet hops. The hops are great. A nice mix of stuff that does not remind me of just cascade. Very good, very homebrewy. The double iPA is well hidden, like all great double IPAs. Why do west coasters call this a double?

Crystal clear, light golden color with a soft, well-retaining, white head. The smell is nothing short of a joyous occasion; some pine resin, lemon, grapefruit, and some extra dankness that reminds one of the tropics. Bitter, resinous pine greets the tongue leading to some lemon and grapefruit, followed by more of the pine resin. Incredibly bitter, yet the hop flavor still overpowers the pure bitterness of it.

Lacing is sheeted and copious. The aroma is dreamy, the freshest hops rolling from the glass. Notes of soft, distant pine forests, freshly peeled grapefruits, oranges and nectarines, grass notes all over the place, freshly chopped and sanded wood, dried white flower petals, fresh bready malt and a modest yeast backbone far underneath. Alcohol is marvelously masked, this may as well not have any at all. Peppery pineapple nuances seal the deal, this stuff smells heavenly. The flavor is a rush of soothing bitterness and honeyed sweet malts, with notes of rising bread and a plethora of fresh fruits. Grassiness is even more noticeable, riveting in its freshness. Acidity is just high enough to taer through sweetness and esters, dispersing everyhting evenly across the tongue and allowing full analysis at a relaxing clip. The finish is near perfect, with moderate bitterness, sweetness and alcohol warmth all in harmony. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, softly but adequately carbonated, smooth and awesomely refreshing. A superior ale.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

285,"2007-06-13",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2009 6/13/2007:  Pliny the Elder pours a pretty clear, bright copper/amber color with ultra fine carbonation.  There is some spotty lacing as well.  The aroma is really quite amazing and consists of sweet pineapple, grapefruit, pine, orange citrus, a hint of alcohol and some syrupy caramel and toffee.  The flavor has a nice, somewhat sweet maltiness that deeps and then reveals a substaintial sugary citrus and resin bitterness that is quite good.  The bitterness really isnt overpowering though.  Overall this beer is very well balanced between the hefty maltiness and aggressive, yet somewhat reserved, biterness.  Also, its strong, but the alcohol is just barely noticeable.  The finish has a nice, earthy hop leaf flavor without tasting like hop pellets or being too leafy.  This beer has a medium-full body and is so smooth and very easy to drink considering that it is a quadruple IPA!  Without a doubt, this is a very well crafted beer worthy of its high rating and associated hype!  I bet the hop aroma and flavor just burst out of this beer when its straight from the tap!

Pours a crystal clear golden with a fizzy off-white head that drifts down to a thin covering, little lacing.

285,"2007-04-25",4.3,"Special thanks to MrBendo and mwsf for the hand-bottles!  Mr. Pliny poured a clear, deep, and fiery red with a beautiful initial cap of creamy off-white head... receded to a wispy dusting and a looser ring after a few minutes. The aroma picked up rich, pulled caramel and a faint hint of chocolate surrounded by one of the grandest hop bouquets I have come across... a delectable blend of pine resin, grapefruit, and pineapple.. leaning slightly toward the fruits.  This lost nothing in the flavor department... syrupy foray onto the palate brings heavier caramel and pine resin notes.. bitter pineapple emerges around the tongue and and through the finish while the grapefruit dances through intermittantly... rather high bitterness is adequately balanced by the maltage... leaves very lenghty residual resin bitterness and toffee sweetness for the finish.  Just a fantastic brew!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Some light pine with a trailing edge of resin.  Some great floral aromas.   Appearance:  Deep amber in color and faintly hazed.  Off-white head was full and foamy with good retention.  Good lacing.   Flavor:  Some light bready malt with a bit of caramel.  Ton of hop flavor running the gamut:  Piney and resinous, grapefruit and orange, floral and grass.  Bitterness is pretty strong, but very smooth at the same time.  Dry finish with a bunch of hop flavor carrying over.  Palate:  Medium-full bodied.  Moderate carbonation.  Overall:  Great IIPA.

I was surprised at the color, expected it to be a little darker for an imperial, but the aroma was fantastic. Excellent lacing. Floral, rich and green, smells of pine forest, orange and ginger...and of course the all-glorious hops!  What amazed me the most about this brew was the balance, the hops were near-perfectly compensated by the malts, and the palate was not stingy or too bitter for that matter, but polished in a way that makes you look that much forward to the next sip. Bomb!","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
285,"2007-04-08",4.8,"This was on-draft in a 16 oz glass from the Russian River Brewpub in Santa Rosa.    I have heard a lot about this, so was looking forward to seeing if it lived up to its reputation.  The brews were all listed in various color chalks on a board behind the bar, and according to it this one checked in at 92 BUs and 8% ABV. When it was set in front of me I could smell the hops from two feet away.  This one is potent!  The odor just leaps out of the glass with piney and floral hops. You dont need to take a big sniff to get what is going on here.  Besides the hops, there are also some wonderful rich malts, nuts toffee, caramel, and fruit.   I cannot imagine a beer smelling any better than this.  As a pub pour it came without any head, but after drinking off the first inch, and almost swooning in the process, I swirled it and got a nice fat off-white head that left lots of fat chunks of lacing on the sides of the glass. A beautiful light orange, this is a feast for the eyes and as the head slowly settles down you are so taken by its overall beauty you almost hate to disturb it. The flavor is similar to the nose, and while the malts and the hops dominate, there is a serious bitter finish worthy of a DIPA.  The mouthfeel was excellent, very rich and creamy and simply glides across the teeth and tongue.   It tastes just as good going down the pipe as it did at first sip. The brew is simply incredible.  It has that wonderful bitterness that all great DIPAs should have, and hides the alcohol very well.   It is too bad this is only available on tap, because I would love to share this with my friends so they can appreciate it also.  I have been saving a second 4.8 for just a brew like this.  Ranks with the best beer I have every had the pleasure of drinking.  Maybe Pliny the Younger will be that perfect 5.0 if I ever get to taste it","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"

But theres a decent underlying soft malt presence that keeps the whole thing in balance and maintains supple, yet firm mouthfeel. Theres plenty of bitterness there but it is neither harsh, nor grating and is not too dominant. Sure its a hop monster, but its assertive, rather than aggressive. Just the way it should be.

Handbottled sample while at ZBF. A healthy serving was kindly poured into my glass by Mads. Yet another HUGE thank you sir. Jeeeeesus WHAT a smell. More than anything (superb quality of the rest of it aside) this is all about the smell. Imagine a perfect summers day and laying in a field filled with the most aromatic smells that summer has to offer. Pine, spruce and a full rack of even the most impressively stocked kitchens spice and herb rack. Was funny to watch the sheer glee on the face of every one who smelled this. My glass seemed to last a hell of a long time and I eventually realised it was because I was just sat there sniffing at it rather than drinking it. The flavour follows on where the aroma left off. Its a full on hops fest. All the same stuff as the nose really but who are we to argue. Almost chewy in the body superbly balanced, herbacious, floral and as Mads noted a infinitely satisfying warming finish. Truely sublime on every level but that smell... it is clearly one of the best experiences a man could have. Almost a crime to drink it but hey, its just so tasty.

A: Pours a beautiful, clear orange with an ample, fluffy head that lasts quite some time, leaving a tremendous amount of lacing as I quaff it.

S: I already knew how great this beer tasted before I decided to review it, but the aroma doesnt live up to the flavor IMO. Some nice notes of the grapefruit/pine and maltiness that is to come, but the scents dont do the beer justice.

T: Im not sure words in the English language have yet to be created to describe the godliness of this beer. An immediate blast of sweet grapefruit hoppiness blasts the tongue, followed by a delicious and tantalizing mixture of additional maltiness, and finishing with a piney bitterness. This beer is perfect. Fact.

D: Well, hate to penalize it at ALL, but its TOO drinkable and at 8% ABV, just one growler is pushing the limits. A superbly dangerous drinker.

285,"2007-02-07",3.9,"From growler, Capones of Norristown, PA.  Pours a clear dark gold to light copper colored body under a one finger fine bubbled white head that faded to a thin film.  Aroma is of resiny and piney hops over a hefty bready and lightly toffee malt base.  A light note of alcohol.  Flavor is resiny hops with a very aggressive bitterness that starts mid-swallow and lingers well into the long finish.  Theres a good base of crusty bready malt, but it stays out of the way of the hops for the most part.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick with a slightly sticky resiny finish.  Perfect pinpoint slightly fizzy carbonation cuts the texture well.  Pretty darn good stuff.  I liked that it wasnt sweet in the slightest and the alcohol was totally hidden.  Now to track down the Younger!","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
285,"2007-02-03",4.5,"The aroma was piney, resinous, and citrusy with a strong fruity character and an orange note. Malt lurked behind with a bit of a bready character, but was certainly kept at bay by the hop presence which was also a bit grassy. The beer was very lightly hazy golden amber with a low white head which did lace the glass. The flavor was strongly piney and grassy with orange and grapefruit citrus and a well achieved malt backbone to balance the bittering aspect of the hops. The body was heading toward medium full and the carbonation was a bit low (perhaps due to being a growler), but the beer remained creamy in the mouthfeel. Alcohol was really only a factor in some mild warming after consumption. A really nice Double IPA.

Flavor was a bit blander than the aroma, with some pine and grass coming through but without a lot of malt to back it up and also without a whole lot of density, making it feel a tad thin overall.

285,"2007-01-18",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2007 I guess its about time I rate this one, Ive had it on the East Coast, on the West Coast and in between.  Recently just had about 8 or 9 tulips between Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Hop Devil on the weekend of the January 12th 2007Always a perfect appearance.  Bright and perfeclty-conditioned, with a brassy-gold body with just a tint of deeper copper.  White head is painted atop the body, providing moderate lacing.Keeping with my off-kilter RR reviews (except Damnation and Salvation), Ill just give my thoughts on this one in no particular order, since already so much has been studied and said about this one.First off, not nearly as good as P the Younger  ;)  More apparent, bare bitterness and not as complex a hop aroma.  Pine and citrus dominate the hop schedule, and while there is some excitement added by wintergreen and juicy floral hop notes, it remains pretty citric in the end.  Clean, bare, base malt with only a pinch of medium-dry caramel is there in support, but allows the hops to fully glow.  High strength of aroma, perpetually sniffable.  Clean, flawlessly executed and dry without going overboard on the dryness.Hop juices, oils and acids all collect on the tongue as significantly more complexity arises out of the flavor than I would predict from the aroma.  Nectarines, peaches, mangoes and white grapefruit, with a lime-like bitterness all combine for an intense flavor.  High dextrines soften and control the bitterness, for the most part, and allow the acids to more gently cleanse the palate on the end.  Malt dosent get in the way, thats for sure, but it provides strong texture as it should, in a DIPA.  A light hint of yeast (b vitamins) is apparent on the end.  Hop acids definitely win out in the end, and begin to fatigue the palate over time.  The grapefruit and lightly hard pine resin get a bit monotonous as well.  But the relative dryness and perfect texture (extremely tight, engaging carbonation) keep it solidly drinkable for its strength.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Im not much of a hop head, but I figured I wouldnt be seeing a beer like this on tap in New York for a while and I should be developing my tastes anyway.  Had a nice golden hue with some creamy white head.  Pleasant aroma of pine and grapefruit.  The taste was more on the grapefruity side.  Though Im not much of a fan of grapefruit itself, I did enjoy this particular flavor.  Plenty of hop bitterness to go along, as was expected.  Didnt catch much alcohol in the taste though and the bitteness didnt linger too long in the finish; both pluses.

Imperial or ""Double"" IPAs might come close, or get as good, but they dont get any better than Pliny the Elder. This beer is a true bench mark of Imperial IPA, and is just dripping with hop character. This beer pours to a burnt orange color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a soft carbonation. This beer just explodes with zesty and pungent,  citrus/grape fruit hop aromas that flood the nose. The palate is firm, with good pale and carmel malt flavors, paired with really zesty grapefruit hop flavors that zing on the tongue. Pliny the Elder finishes with more fantastic citrus hop flavor up front, then ends with a citrus bomb of hop bitterness that lingers, and just hangs on the tongue, with some peppery alcohol.

10/11/08 - Bottle/Update.  I agree with my prior assessment, but I bumped a few of my numbers as I enjoyed this quite a bit more this time around (and probably because I didn’t drink a 100 other beers the same day).

Aroma is lovely and clean: fresh cascade hops (citrus/pine, slightly floral) over a background of sweet malt. Big bitter kick at first taste, resinous/piney hops are the main flavor component. Grapefruit comes through in the moderately-dry finish. Bitterness and grapefruit flavor lingers. The malt is a bit understated for my taste; could be sweeter. Medium body with a nice alcohol tingle but definitely undercarbonated. Why on earth is this on a handpump?

I brought a growler home from the brewery a couple weeks ago, and the carbonation level was much more appropriate, though unfortunately I drank the first glass much too cold and subsequent glasses (days later) showed definite oxidation. Based on a small taster I had at the brewery, it seems likely the beer would deserve a higher rating if served properly.","Berkeley, California, USA","ghorsche"

Honeydew, simcoe reverence, melon drops, sugary fried grapefruit, honey dipped lemongrass and sugary accolades through the roof.  Starfruit, kiwi and dried apricots bring up the aromatic rear.  If the nose ran the show, this beer would be filed under ""perfect.""  Fulfilling flavor achieves fruity dryness with orange powder and strawberry kiwi.  Subtle flavor composure leads into a bitter exposure that is then translocated to honey brushed grapefruit pulp.  Medium bodied, good temperature and great tempo.  An absolutely solid, balanced, imperial IPA.  Grapefruit and kiwi chunks floating in clementine juice stir up a stark revelation of a dry, clean and bitter finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Gorgeous aroma.  Bright clean grapefruit and pine resin with a light spiciness over the top.  Lots of light resinousness on the back as well.  Crisp maltiness on the back that just lets the bright hoppiness shine through.  Zesty and very bright with a long lingering hoppy finish.  MMMMM.  Why cant I get this stuff here?
Tap at Spuyten Duyvil.  Hazy light amber beer, thin white head.  Beautifully fresh hoppy aroma.  Grapefruity citrus, cascade, pine resin.  A bit of pepper which adds nicely to the refreshing aroma.  Flavour is well-hopped, citrus/pine, a touch of tropical fruit and orange.  Strong enamel-peeling resinousness flavour.  Great bitter finish.  A touch of bready sweetness but only enough to suggest that this isnt straight up hop juice.  Oh, yeah, did I mention its awesome?

This was tasted side by side a homebrewed version which was brewed from Vinnies homebrew recipe who should also get major thanks for sharing his recipe and the opportunity to drink a good authentic west coast style IIPA in a place where little to none exists otherwise.
Medium gold in the pour with an average sized head.
Floral, resiny pine, citrus rind aroma. 
Light to medium body. The hops in this are intense, but more so in the aroma and flavor than appearing as an intense bitterness. The first sip is a bit harsh, but quickly this grabs the tongue and every following sip becomes more enjoyable. Wonderfully chewy juicy hop finish. Enough underlying malt to keep this in balance. a remarkably well brewed IIPA. The homebrewed version is perhaps a bit fresher tasting, but identical as far as color, aroma and flavor. Dangerously easy to drink and the alcohol level will quickly catch you off guard as you think you into a good session IPA.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

A small Asian man is cutting lemons, limes and oranges for vodka tonics, rum & cokes, and wheat beers on a sandy Texan barrier island. On the tounge, a paltry ascension of crisp clean linens wafts in a flow of citrus splendor, yet drenched in the syrupy density of turbid malts. Here, Im stubbled with Mayflies, calling to the low lying blueberry shrubs for a another round. Give me your sweet juices and another afternoon of pescatory adventures.

285,"2006-02-25",4.6,"Sampled from the unofficially bottled from a 5 gallon keg into 22 oz. bombers by BA RedwoodGeorge, the beer came out well carbonated, and free of oxidation, thanks to the counterpressure filler used during bottling.  The body was clear pale in color, and the head was frothy and stable.  The aroma was a milder version of the grapefruit and pine hops than the nephew beer.  The hop flavor leaped off the taste buds with a citric and salty vigor.  The malt was primarily a supporting player here, with a clean unobtrusive semi-sweet character.  This was more of a spicy rather than bitter hop profile, which suited me just fine.  The mouthfeel was medium and slick, with hops fading off rather than sticking around as a teeth coating film.  This beer was very easy to drink, with no hint whatsoever of the 8% ABV.

Flavor is full of citrusy hops, very faint honey and light malts. Finish is fairly balanced. Overall this is a total hop vehical, with nothing else to cloud the picture. This really is the idea in my mind of a west coast DIPA - pure hops, with nothing else in the way - the base beer really just plays a supporting role.

I growler or drink as much of this beer as I can every time I see it, which is more lately but still not enough.  if that isnt a sign that a beer is perfect and deserves to be scored as such, I dont know what is.  To me, this beer has no flaws, and I kick it up a deserved 0.3 to become a perfecto robusto for me.  Congrasts PTE, congrats Tomme, and lets try to keep this one a secret from now on.  END RERATE.  Wow.  A big thanks to Eric for tipping me off that this was at Ortinos Northside in Zieglerville.  The beer was brought in a pint glass, and presented a hazy gold/dark straw color with a one-finger white head.  The aroma was dense and multi-layered, blasting my olfactory receptors with notes of heavy citric hops, honeydew, and tangerine.  The aroma was amazingly close to Dreadnaught.  Amazingly close!  The flavor was also very Dreadnaughty, with the big hops, citrus including tangerine and orange zest, and honeydew.  The finish was smooth and hefty on the palate, with more emerging fruit as it warmed.  The major difference between this and Dreadnaught is that the latter is a bit sweeter and hotter.  Otherwise, the two are very close.  I loved this one.  One of my favorite examples of one of my favorite styles.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

Theres a nice tropical touch, some sugar cookie.  Everything about it screams that this might be the best IIPA Ive ever had, but its a lye quality that just wont quit.  It sticks on the back of the palate and latches on like a tick.  Im not complaining, its fantastic.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
285,"2005-10-10",3.6,"Clear light gold pour, the head is white and big. Astonishing woody flavours cover the leafy and herbal hops that feel like a perfume. The malt base is potently biscuity and grainy/bready. The aromatic hops seem underwhelmed by the bitterness ones that hide one of the biggest punch Ive yet to feel, but fool is the one who thinks the malt is not there to support it as this has plenty of toasted and cereal maltiness, medium bodied, yet with airy and foamy carbonation.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Fresh bread provides the backbone of the beer, with tropical fruit, citrus and floral hop notes.  The bitterness is assertive - almost too resiny but nice.

Semi-fuzzy carbonation, but plenty dense. Opens with a juicy blast of oily, palate coating resins. Pungent? Yes. But theres enough pristine brightness and oiliness to match. Soft inklings of honeysuckle and bitter tangerine peels take the backseat to a tight wallop of bitterness, though the body remains awash with fresh peach and grapefruit succulence. Doughy malt flavor and toasted grain sweetness tease the palate as it warms.

Orange/coppery color with a thin white head.  Aroma is in your face amarillo hops as soon as the glass was set down.  When I first smelled it, I was instantly reminded of DFH 90 min.  Some malty notes made their way through the citrussy pine forest in the aroma, too, but hops dominate.  Palate is good and full, though not oily.  Just a slick, big DIPA.  Flavor is incredible as well.  Strong citrussy, piney amarillo flavor.  Malt is sweet caramel and bread, but its very much in the background.  The bitterness in the finish was IMMENSE.  We ordered samples of 90 Minute, Ruination, and Stoudts DIPA and found them all blown out of the water in terms of bitterness (that gave us a nice perspective on their respective malt profiles.)  The bitterness is clean, though -- in your face sharp, but not harsh.  Impressive as all hell.  Im excited about the younger.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Jonathan3584"

Draught.  Appeared a orange copperish color with a small white head.  Lacing was decent.  Aroma was bursting with hops.  Everywhere hops.  Citrus, piney, floral, spicy hops.  Hop heaven.  Oddly enough, some great bready/caramel malt notes were in the aroma as well.  How they made its way through the hops, I do not know.  Flavor was equally hoppy.  Floral and citrussy and intense.  Bitterness was pleasantly lingering and in your face. Some moderate ester profile was present: slight apple and peach.  Doughy malt and some caramel sweetness was also present though it finishes dry without any astringency as I would expect from a beer as heavily hopped as this.  Body is perfect for a DIPA and perfectly silky smooth with perfect carbonation.  Man I loved this.  Side by side with Ruination, 90 minute and Stoudts DIPA, the latter 3 tasted like Sierra Nevada.  Excellent beer.  Yes this is a 5 to me though let me note that it doesnt top or equal Dark Lord.  It is just the top DIPA that I have had.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","BlueDevil0206"

17oz bottle.
Clear, honey-colored body is effervescent, topped with a big, fluffy white head that is persistent and leaves prodigious amounts of lace.  The aroma is very floral, fruity, grapefruit-rind, touch of caramel; very quaffable.  Very nice body, medium-full, plentiful carbonation to fill the mouth, creamy, dry finish (a bit watery later on, hence its not a 5).  Flavor of sugared malts, peach, grapefruit rind, pine, a touch of alcohol in the pine, touch of white grape on the aftertaste.  Very easy to drink, extremely well balanced and smooth on flavor.  A bit mellow, actually.  No big, chunky malts; no astringent, punishing hops: Its just refined and tasty.  In a class with Alesmiths IPA (not a traditional double; too big and nice for a single).  I was just in Santa Rosa but didnt stop by RR...Ill have to go back in a few months to try this again on tap.

On tap @ brewery.  I was sadly informed that Pliny the Younger was not available and usually isnt...and had to settle for this lovely beer.  Honey colored, slightly clouded with a white head and wonderful, thin sheets of lace.  Floral aroma with honey, caramel, fruits and a touch of grape fruit rind.  Fullish body, thick foamy carbonation, smoothe and dry.  Flavors of honey, flower pollen, fruit--apricot and grape fruit rind--LOTS of pine and a fairly bitter (sure didnt taste like 100 IBU...lots of malt) finish that lasts quite some time.  A tasty little sucker with kick!  Drinking a few of these on an empty stomach could be a disaster with all of the piny hops and a solid 8%.  By far the best beer of the 8 of theirs Ive had thus far.  Happily the locals love it--hooray for non-beer geeks with good taste! [[Original 8/5/7/4/17]]","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

When they bottle this nectar, Ill attempt again to encapsulate its wonder.
Orange is the color, head is white, full, fresh.
Nose is lovely, floral, fruity, just absolutely aburst with pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tons of citrus...absolutely excellent!
Mouthfeel is slick and run over with hop oils. Taste is exhilirating, a blast of hops on the tongue, medium bodied, with a long, sticky, citric finish, and an utterly tangy texture. This seemed to fulfill whatever desires Id need in a Double IPA, though the 8% abv didnt really make a dent in me...(or did it?)...this was one of the must-trys of my recent California visit, and I had several more samples on the next two days at the Strong Ale Fest just to be sure of its worthiness. Yes. Yes, indeed. Very much so, and then some.

However, there are many trials to overcome on this great path. The first trial, an assult of pine needles to your nasal cavity!!!! Oh the horror! And then trough through a river of sweetness where you are pelted with citrus fruit and unusually large grapefruit!! Oh no!!!! Run for your lives!!

Slightly hazy golden coloured body with a super large off-white head. Aroma of ridiculously pungent piney and resiny hops with a deep citrus note. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong hoppy notes with a deep pine and herbal flavour and some resin on top. Aftertaste is a bit more muted, but the complexity remains and the hops are still strong. Overall, a nice beer - but not amazing and still pungently hoppy.

Unfortunately, this double IPA is less malty than some others in this category, so this ends up being strongly dominated by the hops right from the start, and especially in the finish where wince-inducing grapefruit and hops are pushing the legal limit; For the amount of hops, it is surprisingly moderate in bitterness though; The 8% alcohol is well hidden; Clean and crisp on the palate, though definitely a medium to full bodied beer; Light amber color; Huge carbonation bubbles rise very quickly through the beer; Off white head has average retention and leaves some patchy lacing.<hr>(Draft: OBriens in San Diego, CA; 28-Jan-05) Compared side-by-side with Pliny the Younger, and while I like Pliny the Elder, I definitely like the Younger more.  Again, my impression is that this beer isnt as balanced as I prefer, with the malt just being terribly submissive to the hops.  Very hoppy, very bitter, strong grapefruit, and that remains consistent from start to finish.

But it carries into the balanced body,crisp dry mouthfeel and follow through,giving it Amazing drinkability...
This quickly became my ""back to..."" beer of the fest! It would always bring my palate back to neutral,after some ""less worthy"" brews!

285,"2002-12-07",3.9,"Mr Pliny poured a viscous, cloudy yellow with a very thin head and an intense hop filled aroma. There is absolutely no restraint here to hide the hops behind the maltiness, trust me....it is however extremely smooth given the dry citrusy hops I was exposed to. The aroma totally got me in the mood for this one, and the finish wasnt bad either. Its solid, and the florals get the job done.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
285,"2002-12-07",3.8,"Huge hop aroma. Poured a copper brew with a thick tan head. Hop aroma just jumped out of the glass. Piney with a big resiny mouthfeel.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"

285,"2002-12-07",3.7,"Wow the aroma leapt out of the glass and grabbed my nostrils saying that they were taken hostage by huge amounts of hops.  the flavor is the same, lots and lots of west coast citrus hops.  Golden clear in appearrance.  this one is definitely full of hops.  bitter finish hung around in my throat i need a barleywine to wash it out.  good stuff though and great name.","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"
285,"2002-12-01",3.9,"Great hops, smooth bitterness, balanced by the 3 Cs.","San Francisco, Alabama, USA","sarie99"
285,"2002-12-01",3.9,"Hops!!!  Medium carbonation, malty.  Smooth bitterness.  Perhaps some centennial, cascade, columbus hops.  For the hophead in all of us.","California, USA","stephen"
285,"2002-11-21",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2014 I first rated this a 3?  what was i on? crack? super piney and bitter..not too sticky..and super hoppy bitterness in the end.. Re-rate 11/9/2014: Im a different person these days dont even think Ive rated a beer in a very long time because rating beer is a chore that doesnt pay, what the fuck is the point? But I will up rate it to 4.5 because thats what I think right now.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
285,"2002-10-27",3.8,"One of the best...wet hopped with lots of flavor.","Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, USA","gbzia"
285,"2002-10-17",4.3,"I was having an IPA marathon night in San Fran and this just added to the long list of great IPAs out of the golden state.  Pronounced citrus flavor from the hop combination, Cascade is in there I am sure, not too dry which I feel can detract from some IPAs flavor profile, Carbonation lingers on the back of the tongue and tingles smoothly down the throat.  A beer worthy of the coin plunked down for the pint!","Seattle, Washington, USA","schm1005"
285,"2002-10-10",4.1,"Cloudy straw color. Nice head. Strong grassy hop aroma with some malt. Full on hop blast in the flavor department. Quite bitter with a ton of grassy hop flavor. Enough malt to balance it out, at least for a West Coast IPA. Thick and full bodied. Only hopheads need apply.","San Francisco, California, USA","mwsf"
285,"2002-09-25",4.0,"Good fruity IPA but I think it would be better if it were a little less fruity and a little MORE dry and hoppy.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","herbstress3"
285,"2002-09-03",4.6,"(cask)Not much of a head to speak of but thick and gold like honey in a glass.  Stong hops and pine in the nose and unbeleivably smooth hops in the flavor.  Thick coating mouthfeel and a little bit of malt. Hops have never been so smooth.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
285,"2002-08-10",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2005 Tap @ Tornodo in San Francisco (7 3 8 3 16).  A hop citrus aroma with some fruit.  A golden color and a white head.  Bitter.  Rating #2 (8 3 7 4 16) Tap @ Barclays.  haxed orange color with a frothy white head.  Aroma has pine, citrus, flowers, fresh cut grass, and a load of hops.  Mediium to full bodied with a lingering grassy hop aftertaste.  Slightly harsh by the time the pint is finished.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
285,"2002-03-28",3.7,"Another great left coast hop monster.  Clean maltiness allows the boatload of hops to shine right through. (As if they werent going to on their own.)","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
285,"2002-03-13",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2008 Very fresh, hoppy nose out of the keg.  This beer is about the hops, with the bitter being the predominant flavor.  Maybe could have used more malts to balance it better, but a great hop-head beer.  12-13-08 Out of the botttle.  Great fresh hop nose, better balance than I remember.  Excellent hoppy beer.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
285,"2001-08-26",4.4,"This is way more than all hops for me. An involved zymurgistic sketch. This is a hoary ancient Russian River beast who smells exactly like that -- dusty dog, earwax, ivy, wet earth in a cave. Big hop flavors thinning over a bone dry body to an evening mineral, dusty finish. A monster, yes.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
285,"2001-08-19",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2008 This is the Platonic ideal of IPA.  Pure, unadulterated cascade hops in a glass. Ive never had any IPA that even comes close to show casing the hop like this beer.  

If you like hoppy beers, this is the best. The best.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
