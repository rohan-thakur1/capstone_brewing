3090,"2017-04-29",4.3,"Smoked rye wine (anything goes these days) aged on oak barrels, bottle from Bierhalle Deconinck. Thin but stable, pale greyish beige head lacing in disparate dots and settling into a thin moussy rim and some foamy patches in the middle, over a hazy, very dark chestnut brown beer with reddish burgundy hue, still fully translucent under bright light. Rich, old and fascinating hybrid aroma of roasted chestnuts, moist peat, caramel, very old sweet sherry (oxidized), dried plums, candied fig, lots of soaking wet oak wood including vague vanilla-ish tannins and a lot of palpable old furniture, blue grapes, maple syrup, old red wine, dark honey, wood glue or even varnish, soggy grey rye bread indeed, hints of elderberries, beef stock, peated whisky, roast beef, madera, blood, dried bell peppers, old cumin seed. Sweet onset, lots of residual sugars, candied figs, marmelade touch, raisins, some pear, surrounded by a balancing blackcurrant-like sourishness and a dry meaty umami touch; softish carbo, smooth and slick, resinous, bit glueish mouthfeel. Toffeeish malt sweet body with deeply nutty character, toasted edges in the end, but clearly partially oxidized, with eventually a retronasal effect not unlike very old dry sherry or dito madera - the age of the basic beer shines through in the most elegant way possible, avoiding any rusty or otherwise disturbing oxidation. Finishes in ongoing maltiness, sweet and even slightly honeyish with bittering toasted edges, adding a lot of complexity: a ton of almost furniture-like but supply fresh, wet oak tannins (with drying effect), earthy, deeply situated but still peppery hop bitter touch structurally working very well, earthy yeast notes with mild spicy effects and the expected afterglow of rum-like alcohol. The residual sugary sweetness from the onset gets the last word - this beer ends where it began, but through a most beautiful ride of depth, sagesse and complexity. Smokiness lies on top of it all - but not in the sense of smoked meat-like malts, rather the new peated effect whisky barrel-ageing can cause, yet without descending into unpleasant chemical iodine-like dominance, though a certain varnish-like effect likely linked to this peated factor does linger in the very end. Peated, sweet, rich, boozy and partially maderized (as in: aged in its most gracious way), this beer boosts complexity in a beautiful way, with all components cleverly matched against each other. World class for sure, Nogne did it again, a true gem and necessarily a slow, contemplative sipper aptly qualifying as a dark barleywine with strong old, aged quadrupel-ish features - should have saved this for a gloomy winter evening rather than a bright and gentle spring afternoon!","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
3090,"2017-04-19",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2017 Bottle. Dark brown pour. Aroma has red fruit, boozy oak, smoke, subtle peat and ripe fruit.

3090,"2017-02-17",4.1,"This beer truly is a blend of styles. Theres smoke and caramel sweetness from the smoked barley wine sunturnbrew. Theres oak and vanilla from the barrel ageing. Theres chocolate, liquorice, roast and coffee from the old ale. Also raisins and grapes are present. Alcohol is well hidden. Light bitter finish. Medium bodied.

3090,"2017-02-05",4.3,"Ever so slowly building up, but finally good, very dense & fine and even very stable greige head, over pitch black beer. Adherent lace. Alcoholic, spirit-like nose; faintly smoked, black cardamom, bit soapy and sweet chocolate. Even more black carcamom in the flavour; liquorice, coffee milk. Ever so slightly peppery, even chilli. Smokiness is not very apparent in the mouth, nothing to see with Rauchbier. Very thick, viscous body, nearly as coffeemilk indeed, the head helping; soft carbonation. Cardamom all the way, but in the aftertaste bitter chocolate joins the milk-. The more one sips this, the more complexity reveals itself. This is a truly remarkable brew.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

3090,"2017-02-04",3.9,"On tap at Duggfrisk. An unclear dark brown beer with a dense, finger-thick beige head. Its slightly boozy on the nose, with roasted matls, some chocolate and a good dash of brown sugar. Hints of smoke and dark dried fruits. Its full-bodied, warming and soft on the palate, with a good sweetness, roasted malts and some cellar hints. Not in an oxidized way though. Dark chocolate and brown sugar too, hints of prunes. Not much smoke detected in the flavor, neither initially nor in the finish. Lasting roasted, warming finish with all the other goodyness on the side. Not as good as Sunturnbrew, but sure a fine brew anyway. 160819","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
3090,"2017-01-27",3.6,"Bottle from La Caisse de Bieres. Pours a short brown head with strong and warm nose of aged bourbon or port wine. Dark brown colored body. Tastes like a barley wine which lacks some thickness but with a long mouthful of aged hops.
