3615,"2015-12-11",3.8,"On tap at Trappist Provisions. It pours a deep golden orange color with an off white head. The aroma is balanced between herbal hops, light fruit esters and toasted malt. Very pleasant,. The flavor is the same. Very clean toasted, lightly caramel malt with some strong herbal hop flavor and bitterness. Hints of fruity fermentation esters, but very much in the background. Super easy to drink and subtly complex. A very different beer for Cellarmaker, but a winner regardless.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
