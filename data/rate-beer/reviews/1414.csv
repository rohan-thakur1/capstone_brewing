1414,"2017-01-26",3.5,"Un singulier produit offert par Lrs Trois Mousquetaires qui passe malheureusement trop souvent sous le radar. Pourquoi? Car cest une régulière depuis bien longtemps. Cest un style dinspiration allemande. On choisit toujours la nouvelle bière sauvage et barriqué de lheure. On a limpression quon la connaît par coeur... Mais combien de gens la connaissent vraiment par coeur? Ce soir, javais envie de revisiter cette bière que jai le souvenir davoir bu à lépoque et que finalement, je ne connais pas du tout. 
Je vis un conflit. Jai devant moi une bière dinspiration allemanfe qui au nez présente un profil qui me rappelle la levure souvent employée en Belgique. De la gomme balloune dans une Pilsener? À moins que ce soit les malts grillés fermentés à froid qui créent cet effet? Très étonnant et hors-normes, du moins pour le style. Franche amertume à laméricaine se développant dans ma bouche alors que la nature Lager de la bière ne se camoufle pas. Belle densité en bouche.

1414,"2016-01-12",3.9,"750mL bottled July 3, 2015, drunk 1/10/16.  Thanks to Yourilevesque for the bottle!Fantastic pour to it, obviously unfiltered/bottle conditioned, with a massive auburn-flecked beige head that is very well-retained. Lovely looking chestnut-mahogany body shows good clarity and plentiful carbonation.Earthy/dusty yeast notes in the nose combine with black pepper, red apples and cherries and tons of fig/raisin and caramel. It all balances nicely; a good mix of both earthy/peppery and fruity/rich. Quite clean, with no alcohol whatsoever.Rich, well-malted caramel, toffee and raisin notes are supported by a soft, supple texture, tight carbonation and earthy, crusty bread notes and peppery hops on the finish, lending balancing dryness. Light vanilla, a hint of soft smokiness and tons of slightly tart fruit notes (apples, cherries, plums, prunes). Good bitterness to it, probably more than a traditional sticke alt, but it doesnt have any resulting resin or anything like that, and does help keep the beer balanced and drinkable. Really nice, no burnt/scorched earth notes or anything weird that some raters have claimed. Only real detractors I found were a bit too much buttercream-like character stemming from the strong c-malt, also producing a bit too much sourdough-like character.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

It still drinks well. Lots of dark stonefruit coming through with a predominant burnt and savoury fruit note that grips the swallow and lasts long int the aftertaste. Frothy and full mouthfeel. Lasting herbal notes too. Welcome, assertive bitterness on the peak has lasted the bottle age. Honey and figs upfront. Between the funk of age and where this would be fresh Id say this is a slammer of an Altbier. Aged elegantly. Delicious.

1414,"2015-08-15",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2016 Canadian interpretation of Sticke, a stronger version of Alt. Thick and dense, pale yellowish beige, moussy head resting on top of a beautifully deep copper red beer with slight amberish hue, containing masses of tiny bubbles rising up from the bottom, perturbing a very fine haze of minute yeast particles divided equally throughout the liquid. Pretty beer for sure. Aroma is a bit more restrained than expected, but rustic and attractive, with impressions of toasted bread, walnuts, a hint of sweet cherries piercing through, dry moss, some rhum-soaked raisins, dry tea leaves, caramel, straw, weak notes of gingerbread, sherry and dried orange peel. The same kind of noble restraint comes forward in the taste, beginning with a mixture of nuts and dried berries, only very vaguely sweet, toasted from the start with just the right (soft) amount of carbonation, balanced with a subtle sourishness in the background; a smooth, caramelly but most of all very nutty and toasted maltiness carries hop bitterness in an early stage, resulting in a very long and very dry, deeply bitter finish, almost like in an American-style barley wine, leafy, peppery, earthy, but low in aroma. In all: this beer has the class and nobility of the best of Düsseldorfs Altbier (Im thinking Uerige and the like), but is notably distinctive in its much more forwarded, longer and harsher hop bitterness, though fortunately the brewers have refrained from using very aromatic citrus hops and opted for a deep, earthy, European hop character instead, although I cannot completely exclude the possibility that a part of the hops aromas have gone lost, as this bottle has been aged for a while. Whatever the case, this is an Alt with a hoppy belly, and in many respects a very accomplished beer. I do wonder about the label, which clearly says red lager, whereas true Altbiers are lager-like but top-fermented. Is this truly a lager? In a style which is almost in between top fermentation and bottom fermentation, this is really hard to tell...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1414,"2013-01-28",4.0,"I love discovering hidden gems in the beer world. I got a bottle of Les Trois Mousquetaires Sticke Alt in a ""Yankee Raffle"" at my homebrew clubs Christmas party. I wasnt very excited about it, so I let it sit in the fridge for nearly two months before I opened it. Now that Ive tried it Im sorry I waited so long since its a flavorful, complex and overall impressive beer. 

I poured a 750ml corked and caged bottle into a goblet.

Appearance: Beautiful chestnut/mahogany/ruby red hue. Though dark, plenty of fine carbonation can be seen streaming up the side. Forms a large, beige, frothy head which laces and retains wonderfully.

Smell: A sweet, nutty aroma plus significant dark fruit and classic Belgian yeast esters. Interesting and inviting.

Taste: The altbier style is definitely underutilized and underappreciated, and a well-brewed version like Les Trois Mousquetaires Sticke Alt, makes me wonder why it isnt more popular. In the case of this beer, it could be the fact its not a familiar palate. In fact you could almost describe it as a cross between a robust English brown ale and a Belgian dubbel. You wouldnt normally compare those two, but in this case it works well.

It begins with a medium caramel note, followed by distinct nutty flavor. Some bitterness through the middle quickly gives way to an even richer flavor of stone fruits and dried fruits. I notice a resurgence of the caramel flavor as the beer finishes, which is nice. The only problem with this beer is the constant, noticeable yeast taste throughout the palate. Its close to table black pepper, or just a general dry flavor that distracts from the otherwise sweet, malty palate. 

Drinkability: With a thick, full body and energetic carbonation, this is actually a sipping beer despite the relatively light weight of only 6% ABV. The texture is creamy and soft, but the beer has a heavy presence in the mouth. Its pretty easy going down, though the dryness does linger and is a bit cloying. Les Trois Mousquetaires Sticke Alt drinks like a heavier beer than it is, since theres so much flavor to it. Though I had no trouble killing an entire bottle by myself.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

While some reviewers are claiming this beer is complex, I have a hard time tasting anything other than the hops. I like heavily hopped beers but this seems to have a harsh hop taste as opposed to the pleasant bitterness that I like in so many beers. Certainly not a very well balanced beer.

1414,"2011-02-18",3.9,"Ah le vendredi, quelle belle journée pour faire le plein (disons la moitié dun plein) chez nos amis Les Trois Mousquetaires, boulevard Matte.  Fraîchement embouteillée, la Sticke Alt me semble le meilleur choix pour débuter ce merveilleux et trop court week-end.  Mais allez, arrêtons cette divagation lyrique somme toute inutile et passons immédiatement à ce bon plaisir de la vie quest cette bière appréciée depuis le tout début de son existence.  Une fois versé, le liquide profondément ambré se présente chapeauté dune mousse beige assez solide.  Déjà, après quelques gorgées, on peut apercevoir quelques traces collées au verre, une dentelle difforme et clairsemée.  Le nez est très agréable, construit autour dun malt qui transpire une richesse certaine, voire légèrement biscuité avec une touche dorge sucré et de caramel.  Enfin, peut-on dire aisément que le malt est assez intéressant pour vouloir sy perdre quelques minutes afin de le complexifier davantage.  À travers les grains maltés, des esters fruités se dessinent avec timidité et veulent se coller autour de houblons très frais, très parfumés et aussi épicés.  Le goût est dabord laffaire des houblons : une attaque contrôlée empreinte dune robustesse poétique sans aucune agressivité mais ô combien efficace et appréciable.  Le malt est au garde à vous, répondant au moindre fait et geste du humulus en étalant de tout son corps défendant ses multiples saveurs douces.   En bouche, le liquide a une densité moyenne à faible (malgré la volupté de ses saveurs) avec une effervescence posée et une texture douce.  En finale, la rencontre des houblons et du malt permet une amertume décente justement récupérée par un arrière-goût agréablement doux de noix mélangées.

1414,"2009-05-22",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2009 5,99$ for 750ml, 2008 version, dumbly-store-aged; I saw it cheaper although Id pay even more for this one.  No wonder it scores so high in the style!  Powerful fruit hop aroma. Very tasty, malty sweet and hoppy bitter, long grapefruit bitter aftertaste.  American-style hop that has more power in the taste than I remembered from last summer (aging?).  Id really like to try the 7,2% 2007 version if I could find it...  This Alt is climbing here...","Terrebonne, Quebec, CANADA","bedainedebiere"

Quite a bit of noticeable hops, excellent mouthfeel.

The nose is an interesting one, showing notes of apple skins, walnuts, caramel malts, and perfumy, floral hops.  Caramel malts lay the groundwork for the flavor, with nutmeg spice, and hints of lactose shining through as well.  Candied flower petals and biting, peppery hop notes finish things off.  The palate is medium-light in stature with lively carbonation.  Overall, this is a decent Alt.

1414,"2008-08-14",3.1,"Pours into my 25cl tulip glass with a fairly dense, tan colored, initially three-finger thick head.  The beer is a murky, concentrated, dark amber color that shows a deeply hazy, bright red color when held up to the light.  The aroma has lots of caramelized malt notes to it that are lightly offset by some spicy hop notes.  Sweet smelling, with a berry / raisin like fruitiness, aromas of toasted malt, spicy hop notes similar to cinnamon and candied lemon zest as well as a touch of herbal notes in the finish.

This has a rich, caramelized sweetness to it that does not taste overly cloying.  This up front sweetness is balanced in the finish by both an herbal hop bitterness (that is just a touch green) as well as a toasted malt character (almost a cocoa note there towards the end too).  The mix of caramel malt and spicy hops contribute a flavor that is something like cinnamon, though not quite.  The malt contributes a touch of nuttiness to the flavor profile as well.  The hop character here is actually pretty significant; the over-abundance of caramel malt notes here make you forget about them at times, but there is a fair bitterness this brew as well as a lightly grassy, definitely herbal and a certain, candied citrus peel note that are each quite distinctly noticeable once you try and ignore the malt.

This is a very rich brew with an over-abundance of caramelized malt character; it is really just a bit too much, though it doesn’t make this undrinkable.  This definitely has a touch of murky malt flavors to it that go along with the appearance; actually I am surprised how murky this is even after sitting in my fridge for a couple weeks.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

In mouth though, they thunder (for an alt) with grassy, leafy, sandy nuances. Beautiful hops with enough bitterness to feel coherent with the relatively thick malts that manage to avoid the trap of sweetness. So superb malts, remarkably dry, yet flavourful. Tight and coherent bittering hops. Clean profile all through with perhaps more sandy bitterness than I would have expected, but globally: Oulala! I would have expected better scores. This is a winter in Düsseldorf and at the moment, I dont think any other brewer in Quebec could pull so authentic and good an interpretation on a strong alt.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1414,"2007-08-29",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2008 My Bottom Line:
This lovely Sticke Altbiers balance of well-extracted bready caramel malts and ripe herbal, wooden hoppiness leads to a levelled noble hop bitterness with citrusy tips. Yet another clean, crisp, huggable session seasonal from Les Trois Mousquetaires.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A marvelous, everlasting head sits atop the darkest copper.
-The big-bubbled effervescence is perhaps a little too expansive.
-This doesnt drink like a big beer at all; its very drinkable.
-A tad more malt presence in the flavor profile would make it phenomenal, imho.
-Some fruitiness leaks from the caramel maltiness.
-This is severely underrated!

More hard-hitting and about as interesting interesting as their regular Alt that is more subtle and well-balanced.  Not quite what I expect from an Alt.  Parts of it felt like a Barley Wine Light.
