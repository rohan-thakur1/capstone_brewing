The pour is a darker brown with hints of red shining through with a lighter khaki colored head that falls down slowly. The aroma on this is full of booze. Itll knock you back a step. The cherry comes through after that and a lot of roasted malt and a charred oak. The flavor offers the same surrender to the booze. The cherries and a damp barrel come through after that before there is a little roasted malt and a light tartness on the finish. Its interesting, but not terrible. The mouth feel is a little heavy, with a crisper carbonation and a lingeringly boozy cherry on the finish. The oak pokes back through has well. This is something else.

Deep murky reddish brown body. An aggressive pour yields a good size head.

Smell is mostly cherries. Some dark malts linger behind a strong acidity. Tart and a bit of funk to start. Behind the initial tartness is a nice vanilla and slight bourbon flavor. I probably only taste the bourbon since it said bourbon on the label, though. What I do like is how the tartness returns in the finish.

Full, creamy body; almost zero carbonation. Long, dry, slightly astringent finish that gives way to some fruity sweetness after a while. Watermelon notes. I expected this beer to be sweeter and similar to Rochefort 10, but in fact it reminds me more of Cuvée des Jacobins. A stronger, sweeter, even a bit cloying at times, version of Cuvée des Jacobins, actually.

Naturally, Ive been saving this bottle for a while, and I picked a pretty good time to crack it open! Super dark brown coloured body with a violet and light ruby glow, all with no head, no movement and no carbonation at all. Aroma of sour grapes, cherries, malt, yeast, brett, yeast, pit fruit sweetness, alcohol, vinegar and way more sour notes that are mouth-watering! Medium to Full-bodied; Rich malty flavour at first that shows a lot of sour notes at first then fades to a vinegar and almost rich prune and deep cherry flavour with a good deep malt flavour, some raisin and date sweetness and a complex alcohol flavour at the end, with more and even deeper complexity from the sour notes of grapes, cherries and apples. Aftertaste is nice and robust with malt at first, but all sour and complex fragrant flavours with cherries and grapes at first, but a rich prune and alcohol pit fruit flavour of sweetness comes through at the end, all still with some light chocolate maltiness. Overall, a very nice and rich beer that shows well throughout, leads a lot of complexity down the line, but still has a ton of sour flavours - all this without carbonation, as well. Definitely worth trying and keeping a few bottles of this, if you can find it - ill be looking for more of this to cellar on the West Coast. I sampled this caged and corked 37,5 split bottle purchased from Olive Tree Market Place in San Diego, California on 08-February-2011 for US$16,49 sampled at home in Washington on 10-May-2015 - Mothers Day 2015, a bit more than 4 years after purchase. Great to finally sample this one, but perfect as a celebratory rating!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

Pleasant wqod-glue aromas, a little bit of vanilla, quite sour. Nice dark brown, but glassy - no head at all. Horrific vinegary acid palate. Some sugar sweetness. For looks, I have to add an extra point for the look in Areshs face as he takes a sip, its like a baby sucking on a slice of lemon, but followed by more swearing. Taste has burnt liquorish and rubber, some marmite yeastiness. Apparently whoever wrote the commercial description was unaware that brett doesnt cause battery acid, other little bugs do instead, brett causes funk. So one can only conclude that the brewers dont actually know about how to brew a beer. Ooops, Aresh drainpours his, so does Anna - Marduks up for more and volunteers. For me, this is a complete battery acid fuckup. I guess its an OK vinaigrette salad dressing.

Very thin and pale beige head, requiring some forcing to develop and breaking open in instants, eventually disappearing altogether; colour a very dark brownish purple, like an old port wine, hazy to cloudy, with pale protein flakes at the bottom after adding the deposit. Strong and expectedly very complex aroma of sour cherries, red wine vinegar, cranberries, vanilla, oaky tannins, hint of bourbon, caramel, dusty cellar, varnish but not disturbingly so, sour yoghurt, balsamic vinegar, raisins, figs in jenever, cardboard, tomato concentrate, almond. Complex estery fruitiness in the onset, sour cherries and berries, lemony acidity even drying the mouth, lactic acidity as well, balsamic vinegar, woody tannins coming up quickly over a smooth caramelly maltiness, somewhat dusty, with increasing drying tartness in the finish, as well as increasing woodiness and a hint of warming, port wine- and bourbon-like alcohol, very vinous, with some lingering malt sweetness, truly mouth watering. The sour, dry fruitiness and tannins remain in the mouth long after youve taken your last sip.  This is righteously a classic, a wonderfully complex, woody and fruity sour, which is clearly linked to the Flemish oud bruin tradition, but in a pimped kind of way. Noble, warming, vinous and extremely appetizing: a must if you are into sour beer types. This kind of gastronomic beers are on a par with any great wine, if you ask me.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Smell: Velvety white wine, lots of oak and vanilla combined with marvelously smooth funk. Highly complex, rich. Most dominant beside oak is the light sweetness with orange, red currant, the acetic acid is relatively low key but still the main driving force for welcomed freshness. 


Taste: Red currant, cherry start with soft fruity acidity and some surprising funk and pear. Continuous with light caramel, grain sweetness but is quickly consumed by medium acetic, vinous sour and velvet funk, oak. Funk and oak also come out at the far end, where they linger for a long time.

Acidic cherry skin, red wine grapes, lemon. Oxidation is present, but gives off more of a boozy-sherry vibe at this point, thankfully. Lots of cherry & lots of wet oak in the finish.

1143,"2014-12-07",4.4,"May 4th, 2013 - Ratebeer says I havent, but Im sure Ive had the Cuvée de Tomme before. Why? My very first trip to the GABF (2007, I believe) I remember rushing over to Lost Abbey booth and waiting in line (all of three people) for a taste of the stuff. And Tomme Arthur himself was pouring. It was my first beer celebrity meeting, and is burnt into my memory like a brand into oak. But I neglected to write up a review in the aftermath. Maybe I wasnt ready to translate the experience into words, or maybe I just lost my notes. But I had a chance to re-taste the Cuvée here at Lost Abbeys anniversary party, because it was good, but also because it demands another review - a rare phenomenon in my beer drinking habits. The flavor this time around blends chocolate and sour, turning what would normally be discordant tastes into a gripping harmony. There is also cocoa dust, barrel aged sourness, and flower petals drifting here and there in a brew that is complex in a way I cant parse out after having already had three heavy-weight, beautiful beers. On the aftertaste I catch some ginger candy too, which wraps each sip up tidily like an ornate knot on the top of a furoshiki. The aroma reflects the flavor in depth, intensity and intensity, with the added touch of bubblegum dust (that powder on a slab of Bazooka Joe gum), easing the drinker in to the arcane and inspiring taste ahead.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1143,"2014-10-01",4.4,"a LONG time wish list item. lost abbey bottle and cork, not Port, but listed together here anyway. i was actually steeling myself to be slightly underwhelmed. the last couple LA sours were very good, but not quite great and in my little brain, this needed to be epic to justify its top 30 rank. upon opening the bottle and sniffing the cork, ALL worries went out the window. One of the best aromas of any beer ive ever had. after the amazing grace, which was more sour than expected, this was less, which id have thought a bad thing, but the slightly tart chocolate covered cherry and tobacco aroma was just amazing. the tartness comes through a little more in the flavor, but still a minor player. time may change that. pours a red/brown with no head, and the lack of carbonation is the only thing preventing this from getting a near perfect score. were hoping this develops some bubbles in the bottle, as a friend and I each have a bottle to sit on for a while...and Ive never looked forward to the aging of a beer as much as this one.

1143,"2014-02-09",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2015 Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. OK, where to start? The pour is a flat, uneven, cloudy sort of walnut-colored liquid with only a few tiny bubbles forming on the sides of the glass. The nose is as baffling as it is unforgettable. Based on a purely verbal dissection, it sounds like a garbage can, but seriously, put it all together and you get one of the best aromas youll ever come across. The first notes are salty and sour: balsamic vinegar, mushroom sauce, and lime juice. Then come, of course, cherries, in addition to red wine, oak, caramelized sugar, chocolate-covered raisins, apple cider, overripe fruits, and booze. Take a sip, and youll get sour, sweet, and salty -- in that order of preeminence. The mouthfeel is flat, with a medium body and no carbonation. Your lips become sticky after a while and your teeth very much feel the acidity. Call me crazy, but Id love to pour a bit of this on the pan after having seared a couple of nice filet mignons.

1143,"2013-06-14",4.4,"750ml bottle from South Bay Drugs and Liquor: I have been in search of this beer since hearing of it about four years ago. Never had any luck finding a bottle when asking employees at Pizza Port, but it has finally been made available for us humble seekers of beer. Upon pour, there is no foaming or any sign of an attempt for the formation of a head to develop which lead to the thought that this was not a good sign. Once poured, I noticed an instant olfaction of dark juicy fruits such as berries and cherries, but until I stuck my nose into the glass, it wasnt till then did I begin to pay attention to the raisin and wild use of yeast further. The flavor is initially a tart and sour taste that also stretches across the taste buds to allow for a moment of sweetness that will only be a glance of the fruits potential. Obvious mentions of fruit are dark black cherries freshly picked yet unripe and sour. Also, gives me a memory of eating a basket of washed raspberries that have recently been rinsed and they are juicy themselves but with the added beads of water to the flesh of the fruit just makes it that much more juicer and refreshing. Somehow the raisin gets drowned out and takes deep thought to recognize in the faint background of the aftertaste. The yeast has an interesting personality of its own because of the wild funky almost farmhouse like style of yeast present. I now understand why someone could believe this is Belgian strong ale, but in my opinion this falls under a fruit lambic style. Very enjoyable and smooth in its palate that comes across so gently carbonated all for which makes for an easily guzzled liquid.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Theres some yeast and a touch of bourbon as well, and some barnyard / hay. Taste is what makes it so special. Rather than a fresh, fruity sourness, it opens with a thick barrel cask sweetness, almost like a sherry. Then the cherries kick in, and the sourness picks up, but never to become dominant. Finish is long with alcohol, cask and cherries. Body is light to medium. Fairly low carbonation.

Edit: Tried the 2013 vintage, and its still pretty much the same, lots of berries and some barrel aromas, followed by a very fruit and barrel rich taste which isnt as sour as you might expect.

1143,"2012-08-17",2.0,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2012 375mL courtesy of Shane. Thanks! 2012 vintage.

A: Murky brown with no lacing. This is completely flat. Damn.

N: Cherries and bourbon. Vanilla and caramel. The sourness rises just above the cherries. And there are a lot of cherries here. Marionberry and prune. The smell is quite pleasant.

T: Muddy. Lots of sour cherries mixed with an overpowering sweetness of caramel and bitter chocolate. I admittedly cringed a bit. Ive had this before, and it s not nearly as weird, I swear. There is so much cherry here, and it might be the saving grace. If this beer had one. Vinegar and acetone. Honey in a way thats like a mead.

M: Slick and oily and sharp. Not good.

O: I really dont understand what happened here. Last time I got a bottle of this (a 750mL) this was sublime. Tart and sharp and perfect. This is an unmitigated disaster. And I have one more. With any luck, this will taste good in 2014. And if it seems Im being overly harsh, its because I know how good this beer can be","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

1143,"2012-07-27",4.1,"Shared at a small tasting at my place last weekend.

A: Mahogany brown with a pretty small, timid head that doesnt linger.

S & T: The aroma and taste are quite similar. I found them both to be extremely complex with aromas and flavors consisting of cherries, wild yeast, oak, vanilla, malt, misc. spices, bourbon, alcohol. Theres definitely a lot going on here. While its noticeable that the base beer is a quad, Cuvee de Tomme has become an entirely different beast now. The souring and barrel aging have taken over and now dominate the flavor of the beer. That being said, this is a well done, artfully crafted beer that I find intriguing and enjoyable.

M: The feel is medium bodied with sour notes throughout - not the type of sour that makes you pucker, but rather a consistent funky cherry and wild yeast flavor that blends in cohesively among a barrage of scents and flavors.

D: Quite tasty and profound. This is a great treat to share several ways. Recommended.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

The funny thing is, I had a hell of a time getting the cork out... Had to use a pair of pliers to pull the fucker out.  Vinous notes, slightly sour, slightly sweet on the tounge.  Another reminder that this is a completely flat beer, and I will deduct points for that.  This is going on your permanent record, Lost Abbey!!!  I wish this beer was a touch drier.

A - Very small cork of the pop with very little carbonation. Tiny coffee coloured head but dissipated almost instantly. This beer is a very dark hazey brown. Looks closer to a the liquid you get following squashing grapes. On a glass swirl, more red dark cherry colors are apparent. 

S - Dark cherries dominate the nose followed by a very musty basement mold smell. Smells akin to a very old Bordeaux I had in France. Lots of wild grapes and bits of dark fruits and pineapples.

T - Holy moly! This is a total sour bomb. White wine characters of grapes and musty mold. The tartness is very similar to hand picked Muscadines.Nice sour cherries on the back of the tongue. The sour funk and wild characteristics are way more pronounced than expected which must be the age of the bottle. I dont have a 2012 vintage to compare it to. The vinegar notes are great as Im a huge fan of vinegar. Theres a minor hint of oak wood but its very subdued compared to the sour bomb that is this beer.

M - Minor carbonation on the mouth swish. Medium body. Huge sour funk that lingers for a very long time after drinking. 

O - I was not expecting this to be such an intense sour beer but Im excited that it is. Also, I hear now that the 750ml is a very rare format for this beer and the 2009 vintage.

Cork exits the bottle with nary a whimper. Silence. Poured into a nice tall glass, it exhibits as much carbonation as the muddy brown river water it mimics. Im sure Ive fished in this beer. Aroma is better, sweet & sour cherries, passing oak, alcohol. Smells & looks more like a wine than a beer.

Cuvee de Tomme give me the o-face. Ooooh, man. From the lack of carbonation, the heavy brutishness of the mouthfeel was to be expected, & it flaunts every tick of its 11% ABV. Three sips in & already wishing Id split this with someone. Severe is the word that comes to mind. Sour cherries form the wide base, along with hints wine & oak. Backdrop of rum, sour raisins, prunes.

Well, now Ive experienced Tomme & I have to say Im underwhelmed. Under carbonated, stone-heavy in the stomach, & not much depth underneath the blistering sourness of the cherries. Honestly, this feels like a home brew experiment gone haywire; hard to score, it has its moments, but ultimately, this cant be the intended outcome. I hope.","Minnesota, USA","maximum12"

A small amount of head and bubbles formed but quickly disappeared into what you see on the right.  The aroma on this beer is fantastic.  Dark fruit, sour cherries, oak, and a little bit of alcohol.  Its definitely a sour aroma but its not really big.  Not like some other beers Ive had like this.  Taste is just as good and I was left wanting more when I was done. Up front is a nice sourness/tartness.  Thats backed up by cherries, bourbon, and oak.  Its a great combo of cherries and smokey oak.   Alcohol definitely plays a role here.  It doesnt interfere with the great taste though.  The sourness sits on your palette and lips.  Mouthfeels lies more on the thick side.  No carbonation like I said and silky.

1143,"2012-01-02",4.4,"2011  bottle.  Booze, oak and as it warms I feel there is a tiny hint of dark cherry in its aroma.The aroma is misleading to me when you first taste this beer. Meaning, I did not get much if any aroma of the cherry tartness that comes through in this beers taste. 
I find the appearance of this beer to be pretty. Murky, brown, slight hint of red, greatness in its glass. No head, no lacing. However the non-existence of the head does not necessarily take away from the enjoyment of this beer. Flat thought. 
There is a more upfront palate, not a lot of lingering to me personally. On the top of the palate there is a definite presence, however more like up front.  
It seems like there is somewhat of diacetyl I am experiencing way towards the end of the very minimal lingering of this beer. 
This beer has some definite flatness to it, however I am impressed on how much I like it.

2010 Vintage poured into snifter.

A: Dark red with very very very little carb bibbles on the outer ring. I know this beer is said to always be flat so I expected such.

S: Really nice, acidic vinegar smell with some cherries and maybe a little spice in there. I dont smell any of the bourbon though. Smells a lot like a red wine actually.

T: Great, like the smell acidic, but really well blended with the other flavors. I definitely taste the cherries but I am also getting peach and sour apple, outstanding. The lack of carbonation isnt really bothering me.

M: Dry and flat, but truly not bad.

O: This beer far surpassed my expectations. I loved it. The carbonation wasnt a problem for me, however if there was a bit more this beer would definitely rank higher and be on a whole other level. Worth the hunt if youre into sours.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","alpar"
1143,"2011-06-13",3.3,"Appearance - Not much here, Its a bit murky and thin looking. The color is consistent with a normal quad but the way it moves in the glass gives me a idea that this one isnt vicious at all.

Smell- The smell is a bit sour with some slight Belgian notes of sweet sugar. Its a bit hard to separate the two on the nose alone but I get something unique each time I smell this one. Maybe some sour cherries and fig/raisin notes that come in and out.

Taste- My first impression was this is a great red wine. It really does have very similar notes as a good wine. Initially I thought this is a run of the mill quad spiked with brett and nothing more. I get all the great characteristics one desires in a Belgian quad. The sourness is dominant and doesnt leave a whole lot of room for anything else. This is apparent form the beginning to finish. Im planning on laying this one down for a year or so and seeing if the sourness fades. It may take a while..

Mouth- A bit thin and very little of any carbonation.
Drink- I dont get a lot of booze on this one despite the high abv but the sourness makes this hard to drink.

1143,"2011-06-03",3.7,"A very still pour. I kind of could tell when the cork was fighting me pulling it out. A very dark hue as well. Its not black, but pretty close to it. If I look at a shallow volume of it, it has a nice ruby brown color. More ruby than brown. A slight ring of bubbles clings to the edge of the glass where it is met by the beverage. A very smoky sourness is what I first get from a sniff. Somewhat acetic smelling. I can definitely tell there are raisins in this thing. I get the sweet molasses aroma of them. Almost like a maple syrup in there. There is also, after some time, a considerable alcohol presence in the nose. Smells okay. Wonder what it tastes like?

A very sour, oaky taste is immediately sensed. Leather. Raisins. Sweet molasses. A little tobacco. Very complex. The only hint of cherries seems to come in the back end. It is more like a sour cherry juice feeling as opposed to taste. And not really a mouth feel either. Its like a sweet and sour taste. But not overly cherry. It is very hard to describe. There is a sweet taste midway through each swallow. And a big alcohol warmth in the end. So it starts out sour and tart, then gets to a nice sweetness, followed by a slight warm, sour and sweet after taste. Nice complexity.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

1143,"2011-04-06",3.2,"A flat beer? From Flat Abbey? Whoda guessed it. Poured into a tulip.

2.0 A: Ruddy dark plum color. No head.

3.5 S: Bourbon and cherry are the main attraction and work really well together. Sourness from the cherries and the bugs and vanilla from the barrels. Tangy lactic acid fruitiness. I bet this would smell amazing if there was some carbonation to shuttle aroma molecules to the surface.

4.0 T: I bet it would be amazing if the easy part was done right for once. Usually when bourbon meets Belgian, the bourbon covers all the subtle Belgian flavors. Apparently when bourbon meets Belgian and that meets cherries and bugs, the result aint bad at all. Anyway, sour cherries and lactic acid start this off with a tangy sour punch. Leathery bourbon, vanilla, and oak supplement this well. Light ""supple tannin"" astringency. Vinous with prune and fig fruitiness.

2.0 M: Medium body. Flat, flat, flat, flat, and flat. Super smooth though.

3.5 D: Despite Tommes usual carbonation antics, this is actually pretty good. This would be one hell of a beer with carbonation. This has a lot of things done right, but one major thing done wrong. Shame on you Tomme for releasing your namesake with such a major flaw.

1143,"2011-04-04",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2012 2011: This is the second year that I have had this beer and just based off of my notes from last year, the cherry aroma seems to be slightly more subdued this batch. The appearance is identical to what I remember and the carbonation/lack of head still leave a bit on the table. The taste is wonderful, the front of the tongue seems to have changed a bit. With more bread or yeasty qualities before the mouthfeel is taken over by the slightly tart cherry flavor. I will lower the rating based on the fact hat this years batch is being tasted after having tasting about 150 or so new beers since I first tried this. This years batch receives a 3.6

2010: The aroma on this beer is of sour cherries, wine tannins, and some of the yeast coming through. The appearance is very interesting as it pour with little carbonation, only small bubbles around the side of the glass, but on the tongue with the sour flavor it balances nicely. The taste is great, it has the right amount of sour from the brett, and the sour cherries that is made palatable through the barrel aging process.

1143,"2011-03-31",4.3,"2005 Vintage -- black label. This particular vintage was brewed not at Lost Abbey but at Russian River. Interesting trivia. This beer was at a recent tasting.

Beer is brown and hazy. Forms a thin off white head thats broken and diffuse. Carbonation is low but lacing is high.

Aroma is a surprising mix of alcohol and funk. There are some serious sour notes in this beer but the primary aroma is boozy. This is shocking for a 5 year old beer, although it is 11% alcohol.

Taste is complex, its strong and sweet, the sweetness of the beer is almost immediately cut by the sour. There is a hint of cherry flavor in here and then at the end some oak. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is really good. Its a good beer, I wish I could try a more recent vintage to compare.

So - really though.. the aroma out of the bottle is amazing stuff in and of itself. In fact, the empty bottle still has an amazing aroma. Toasted Oak, Bourbon, Cherry Pits, but more importantly, an amazing vanilla note as well. The vanilla note is actually what seems to hit the tongue first, with the woody oak character, bourbon, and cherry skins, in that order.

Palate is silky velvet smooth with a gentle spice on the front of the tongue. Finish is amazingly calm, mellow, and complex. This 2003 version was the best american sour I have ever had.

1143,"2011-01-12",4.5,"12.7 oz bottle, corked & caged (Lost Abbey 2008 version, sampled 1/12/2011): reassuring pop as the cork is pulledpours a clear, dark mahogany with scarlet highlights.  A pour straight into the glass produces an off-gray, thin head that persists around the edge of the glassPalpable sour cherry aroma with a strong oakiness alongside sweet red grapes and subtle tannins.  Palate is fantastic!  Tiny bubbles and tingly carbonationclose to perfect the years in the cellar have treated this well.  Amazingly tart, lip puckering flavorin some ways shocking and in more ways fabulous!  This proves againdont underestimate Tomme, especially when you give his beers a couple of good years to work! 
750 mL capped bottle (2003, Red Foil #41, sampled 4/25/2005): the deepest garnet; close to black, wow.  Taupe coloured ring of bubbles that is small, but persistent.  The tart aroma assaults the nose instantly as the cap is released.  Soft black cherry notes soothe the senses while bret, sour-aged oaken barrels, strawberry-caramel ice cream and fruity cabernet tingle the nose hairs.  Hints of charred cherry wood and campfire embers add a wonderful depth.  Irony, bretty depth of flavours with sharp oak, vinous cherries and a tang unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Addicting taste  sweet, rich iron and tangy, fruity esters combine with a dry subtle alcohol.  Palate is silky smooth and so full, packed with amazing complexity moist, sour & bitter honey, pineapple rinds & piney yeast.

1143,"2011-01-03",4.0,"750 ml brown bottle. 2009 Vintage. Consumed 12/23/10. A murky brown beer with a small head. medium carbonation. The aroma is lactic, tart cherry, vanilla, vinegar, bourbon barrel character. The taste starts off with a tart cherry then with a drying acetic taste that is quickly followed with vanilla that I guess comes from the barrels. Intensely sour. What makes this an interesting sour is the mix of vanilla bourbon barrel character with the extreme sourness. That combo really cuts through your tastes buds to create a very intense experience. So much that finishing just half the bottle was not easy.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"
1143,"2011-01-03",4.0,"Got the chance to try this great beer thanks to a trade!

A- Body is a translucent mildly foggy mahogany hue. Pours with a thin off white collar that fades quickly.

S-Dark fruit, anise, licorice, oak, a touch of alcohol, a slightly sour/acidic presence, and a hint of chocolate malt. Decent overall but more ripe and dark than wild.

T- Large dose of sour cherry upfront-which is quite acidic and slightly lip-puckering. Chocolate malt is very faint in the background. The sourness fades for the finish as smooth vanilla and soaked oak flavors emerge-but then becomes bone dry-and resembles a dark fruity wine.

M- Smooth, full bodied. Slightly dry slightly juicy characteristics. Soft carbonation.

D- This is a VERY good wild ale. Its a nice dark wild ale that is quite complex and quite sour-but not over the top.

Pop. My notes play the association game more than anything with this one, so Ill stay true to myself, and this review will be some of my stream of consciousness - after all, a large part of enjoying a beer is with how it makes one feel and what it makes one think of - and the rest will be description.

Pours a murky, dark redwood with a finger-nail of head ringing the edge of the glass. 

The nose reminds me of playing hide and seek, hiding in a pull-off air conditioning grate with a claustrophobic companion. Theres an almost vomit-like attribute: solventy, with a deep cherry sourness, along with figs and strong vinegar. 

Very tart and vinegary; think of sour cherry/cranberry juice. Small hints of bourbon and brown sugar from the quadruple base, along with cherry pits, and a good bit of earthy funkiness on the finish. Quite abrasive in most respects. Creamy in the mouth.

Thank you to Ryan and Brenna. Merry Christmas. Let me start this by saying that I am not a fan of sours, but I am trying and this shit is not the easiest in the world to get. Pours dark brown with a reddish tinge to the edges. Very little head, probably due to the age. Aroma is red wine all the way, with notes of alcohol, grapefruit peels and sour cherries. Flavor is grapefruit, red wine, sour cherries, bourbon oak and alcohol. Sour, but not for the sake of being sour. Actually very drinkable in limited quantities.

Though the aroma is tart at first, there are other sweeter notes of port wine and vanilla.  As with the aroma, the very sour cherries stand out first in the taste.  Dry oak, acidic vinegar, and some mellow funk also reside in the taste.  The finish is dry with lingering tart fruitiness.

Some sudsy lace drips slowly down the glass. The aroma is really nice and complex showing a lot of fruity character with soured cherries, cherry pits, grapes, and raisins. The brown ale base consists of caramel malts and oaky vanilla. The brett adds a touch of dryness and a little wild character. The flavor follows and shows a good amount of tartness with the sour cherries, raisins, and other tart berries pushing their way to the front. The oak adds a nice woody character along with the brett lending its signature tartness to the flavor profile. The oaky vanilla seems to smooths things out from being overly sour. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly dry on the palate and finely carbonated, which leads to a sour cherry finish. The alcohol is noticeable on the finish, but not overly so.

I am not a huge sour fan, but maybe I am starting to appreciate it?

1143,"2009-12-06",4.3,"75cl bottle thanks to Guy411.   Working my way through the LA sours, and a pattern emerges: they take a hefty base beer and decimate it with brett and whatever bacteria they are using.   Oh, and Im still 100% on carbonated bottles from Port/Lost Abbey, with this being my 28th rating for them, so there.   Brown-red color with a small tan head.   Lots of sour cherry in the aroma, with some barrel, light bourbon, and clean sour that isnt coming from the cherries.   The flavor has a rich malty base that is toppled by a dry cherry tartness.   Alcohol is present but light for a beer this big.   Then, sourness.   Lots of it, and that is impressive considering the base beer was a pretty malty quad.   Lots of cherry flavor, but there is so much going on that the balance seems about right.   Full bodied with a medium carbonation level and smooth texture.   A huge sour, but very well balanced.   Great beer.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

A little bit of wood in the background, but not much else.  Taste is a little odd and difficult to describe.  The sour character from the scent is certainly there but this one goes through three or four transformations across the palate.  Sour first, wood second, sweet cherry and leather turning back into sour.  Very good.

Pours a viscous-looking/syrupy somewhat clear lightly glowing brown and red with a fine tan/brown head.  Aroma is of huge yogurt and cherries, light-brown sugar (opposed to dark brown sugar), seemingly virgin woodiness (not vanilla), almost cedary like fresh saw dust.  Flavor is quite boozy and tannic at first, plenty of yogurt, moldy dull cherries that are conversely very sharply tart on the back-end, cheesy, the tartness lasts without any degradation though the long aftertaste, finishes very soft and smooth.

[rerate 750ml 2009 bottle thanks to divinci]  Pours a wonderfully dark shinny fairly black with a fine fizzy white/cream colored fine froth.  Aroma is basically the same, full, somewhat rich, creamy, some of that yogurt is still there, much more acidic than last years, bright cherries, miles of woodiness, surprising balance, has a peppery sharpness, slightly more than mild acidity, much fuller and great balance, although the 2008 had great character in its own right.  Flavor follows aroma, fuller, rounder, moer complete, rich, bright cherries, light yogurt, very light, medium strong sharp tart aciditiy, much greater malt presence than the 2008, definitely more authentic Belgian, the malt characteristic is perhaps the greatist difference, provides a smooth rich silky base that is seemingly melded as part of the overaflavor, much much better, great tart sharp cherry zing in the finish.  amazingly smooth, full flavored and bodied.  Medium and slightly more than medium bodied, a hint creamy but mostly smooth, touch oily, with crisp appropriate carbonation.  Job well done. 8.4.9.5.18.  2010 bottle... totally different, flat, aroma is huge of cherries and black cherries, 8 or 9 here.

Really, my nose isnt developed enough to appreciate everything going on here.  The first taste is sour, then turning sweet with a taste of figs, dates, bourbon, and flat out booze.  A second taste really reveals the sourness and I wonder what Ive gotten myself into.  I really like this beer but feel that I cant properly appreciate it... too much happening at once.  The cherries are joined early on by a solid oak flavor, but then it is overwhelmed again by the sour overripe fruit flavors.  Good? For sure.  Up my alley?  Indeed.  Understood by me?

Pours a cloudy, deep ruby brown with no head like flat cherry Pepsi. Completely flat. Aroma is rich in sour cherries, tannins, sherry, oak-aged whiskey. Taste is close to a Flemish sour: mouth-puckering cherries, candi sugar but then shows notes of whiskey, oak chips, hints of soy sauce. A good amount of warming alcohol shows through. Reminds me a lot of De Dolle Oerbier Special Reserva but without the beauty and refinement. I feel there is a large dichotomy over this beer. One person who tasted this with me said it tasted like ""muddy water,"" another said it looked and tasted like ""flat Cherry Dr. Pepper."" Sort of disappointment for rating #600 but it is certainly one of a kind though I would think twice about all the hype. A bourbon barrel-aged quadrupel/lambic is certainly a strange combo and is fascinating but perhaps this is too many disjointed flavors all combined at once. 8/24/2009 8/3/8/4/15=3.8750mL white label Pizza Port Solana Beach guise courtesy of ygtbsm94.

Clear deep ruby with a 1/2 finger beige head, fading to a thick ring rather quickly.  Sour cherries and lactic acid up front with some raisins, brown sugar, bourbon and oak behind.  The flavor has a definite sour and sweet boozy side that are easily discernible, yet do blend together nicely as well.  Alcoholic heat in the back of the throat shows the strength of this beer.  There was also some light leather.  Sourness peaked around a 5 in the semi-dry finish.  Full body with light prickly carbonation.

1143,"2009-08-02",4.6,"Extremely dark brown pour with a minimal head. Aroma is absolutely ridiculous; lots of tart cherry and cranberry, vanilla, bourbon, raisin, fig, molasses- the mixture of sour and sweet and the malt complexity is phenomenal. Flavor is insane- initial hit is reminiscent of a classic belgian strong dark, with some awesome sweetness of plum, black cherry, and raisin. This aspect lasts briefly, and then unfolds into the middle and most lasting part of the flavor, which is a brilliant tart but still incredibly palatable and smooth sour cherry with bretty notes. At the finish, the sweetness comes back, but in a different incarnation from the beginning; here, it is more of an oaky, boozy, and sugary portrayal. Notes of caramelized sugar, molasses, and vanilla bourbon come through. The mouthfeel is also epic; extremely smooth and drinkable, but, like the flavor, is bold and complex- the tongue is never bored. This is an exquisite and unique specimen of beer. One of my all-time favorites.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

1143,"2009-07-28",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2009 Thank you awaisanen for this delicious specimen. Dark brown pour with one finger vivacious tan head. Quick to dissipate, though the aroma surely does not. Aroma is tart at first- reminiscent of a fine kriek. Dark fruit comes through quite powerfully as well, with raisin most evident, and dark sugars such as maple syrup, toffee and caramel poking in more subtly. A slight vanilla bourbon quality is present throughout, which complements the other aromas quite fittingly and uniquely. Flavor is a swirling torrent of caramel, vanilla, tart cherry, unprocessed fresh cranberry, molasses and woody earthiness. Bourbon profile is present, but never distracting, providing a curious but well done complement to the dark sugar sweetness and ultimately the tart fruitiness and acidity. Palate is soft and velvety, providing a sticky but clean and highly quaffable texture. I think this one fell pseudo-victim to Lost Abbeys recent carbonation issues, but there was still a little left. I think it makes it even better than the carbonated one I had last week. One of the more unique beers Ive ever had- quite a masterpiece.

1143,"2009-07-06",3.9,"750ml bomber, shared with two friends.  Pours dark magenta with almost no head.  Aroma is a complex blend of sour cherry, oak, cider vinegar, and fruit peel.  Palate is buttery, oily, and lightly carbonated, with a mouth-coating finish.  Primary flavor was bitter-sour, not sure which was more prominent.  Entry features tangy cherry, vinegar, lemon, and oak.  Mid-palate adds more bitter citrus peel in the mix, perhaps even some brett.  Whatever the components, the heft of this brew is certainly complex.  Cuvee finishes with acidity alongside smoke, dark cherry, and bitterness . . . a blend I found a bit on the sharp side.

Shared with my wonderful wife, who decided this beer was worth tossing out some breast milk.  Pours dark brown and hazy, with just a wisp of head upon its pour, but not much after that.  Smells lovely... sour cherries, dark cherries, oak, some vanilla, cocoa, bourbon, cognac, and brett notes.  Lots more of the cocoa coming out on the taste.  Similar to a fine Flanders red or an oud bruin, but dusted in cocoa powder, which gives a nice bitter contrast to the sourness of the cherries and wood.  Damn fine.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"

Very well hidden alcohol. Very well balanced between the oak and sour cherries.  Amazing depth. Everything is fairly big and out there and to a point, is verging on a very oaky Pinot if there every could be such thing. Definitely some berries (raspberries, blackberries?) in the background.

It has a very thick body for the style and is mouthwateringly sour and salty. This is one of those creative brews in a class by itself that actually works really well. I loved it.

Draft for Sourfest 2009 at Brouwers for SBW.  Pours a dark clear brown with a hint of ruby red.   Great malty aroma with vanilla dominating, but the citrus undertones give you a heads up of what you are about to dig into.  You get some blackberry and cherry undertones, but ultimately a very smooth, good sour.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cprochak"

1143,"2009-05-11",4.4,"2008 Bottling.
Appearance  Pours a light brown color and turns into a cloudy unfiltered medium brown color with hints of amber around the edges. A very small off white head forms and subsides to small ring clinging to the edge of the glass. A swirl of the beer shows some nice legs.

Smell  Large whiff of bourbon, tart cherries, barnyard brett funk, and ocean fresh fish.

Taste  Sharp taste of tart cherries. The bourbon is a lot weaker than I thought it was going to be. A nice sour funkiness to it that really hits you like a freight train, in a great way!

Mouthfeel  Some light carbonation lends quite a helping hand to this beer; a perfect prickliness gives a nice refreshing feel to the sip. Every sip tickles the tongue and teases it, begging you to take another sip.

Drinkability  The alcohol content is pretty high, but this is a small bottle, and I am savoring this beer like it was meant to be savored. Despite the high abv, this one is a huge winner in the drinkability factor.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

1 yr old 08 vintage Bottle as an extra thanks to Craig!Purple-sepia with a bubbly cream head that needed some coaxing. Nose is incredible with a nuanced yet coherent blend of Flemish Sour notes and Strong Ale sweetness: oak, vinegar, plum, and chocolate are married to rich cranberry, cherry, and brown sugar. Flavor has grape skin, cherry, slightly acidic (more vinegar), strong barrel and sugar in the finish with more grape and cherry, minor brett. Though the flavor is complex like the nose, its not nearly as coherent, and some of the acid feels harsh against sweet, sugary fruits. Another problem is the high alcohol, which becomes quite noticeable with warmth. Full bodied, perhaps to a fault, and slightly drying but lengthy bitter oak finish. Very good stuff, the balance in the nose being among the most remarkable Ive sniffed. Its definitely better a little chilled before the alcohol makes its heavy presence known, but all around, this is terrific!

I like the aroma so much because it is thick, yet subdued - very important because it could have become a raisiny mess: bourbon, vanilla, raisin, vague fruit, red wine.  Flavor is the same, really red wine-centric for me (not at all in a bad way).  The vanilla and raisin fall to the background, and the vague fruit clearly becomes cherry which is left to interact with the cab sauv flavors.

1143,"2009-02-20",4.4,"BA review:  

Thanks a bunch to Shane(beachbum1975) for sharing this great bottle.

375ml corked and caged brown bottle poured into a snifter.

A: Pours a reddish brown with pretty decent visibility. A moderate head forms and holds for a bit. Decent lacing.

S: A good sour and funky brett combo. Sour cherries blend with the aroma flawlessly. The barrel has done wonders, oaky, sweet, leathery. The funk further festers following Fahrenheit fluxuation.

T/M: Very nice, smooth, rich dark malty base. Yet again, then pleasantly sour and tart cherries match perfectly with the overall beer... never getting remotely in the way, yet making themselves known and adding loads of complexity. Theres a bit of a burn sugar quality, maybe as if the cherries were scorched, or maybe it could be from the char of the barrels. Definitely a rich leathery flavor and even feel. Tartness builds as the beer warms. A slight alcohol twang in the swallow but Id never guess 12% and its completely hidden other than a bit in the swallow. The body is a smooth medium with good carbonation.

D: Very drinkable. 12% would definitely sneak up on ya.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","pimpp"

Pours clear chestnut brown with red ruby edges. The head is small and fizzes a lot at first, but settles a a thin creamy, beige film on top of the liquid. Aroma is very complex. Lots of oak, the brett is easily discernable, as are the cherries. But there is some underlying notes of sweet vanilla, plums and... I think it is... cocoa powder. Highish carbonation, but still a fine mouthfeel. Compared to how dry it gets later, the slight spritziness is quite fine. Flavour is a bombardment of notes. Starts sweet and malty with plums and raisins. Then the cherries take over, lending it fine dryness and tartness. Then that ends and gives way to the dry oaky notes with vanilla, brett... The cocoa creeps in at the end with the lightly warming alcohol. This is really a great brew.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

1143,"2009-02-16",4.0,"Bottle shared by iowaherkeye. Thanks as always. Poured a dark brown color. The head consisted of a thin off white ring. Attractive aroma of red wine vinegar, subdued sassafras, cherry, brown sugar, and wet leather. There was only a whiff of alcohol. Mildly acidic on the tongue with lowish carbonation. The tobacco, red wine vinegar, cherry, and oak flavors worked well together.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

wow the flavoru hits at all angles with funkiness, fruitness (cherries and figs) great amount of oak to with awesome vanilla hints a decent amount of malt lingers in the back of the palate a terrific finish on theis beer. a great choice for 700.","Merritt Island, Florida, USA","mcbackus"

1143,"2009-02-13",3.9,"375ml 2007 bottle. Thanks a bunch to numbeercruncher for sending this my way. The first sniff was cherries and I expected something akin to supplication but as I poured this into my snifter I quickly realized that this is a totally different animal. Dark brown with red tints. It has a hint of cherry in the smell but there is a lot of barrel going on here, wood, whiskey. The taste is more bourbon barrel, wood, slightly sour interesting mix of flavors. Overall this was interesting but not something I will seek out again. The bourbon flavors are good but dont seem to match up with the sour flavors and really start to wear on me after a while, I wonder what this beer would be like if they had only used wine barrels....

1143,"2009-02-09",4.5,"2008 Bottle. The beer pours a deep mahogany with a tiny tan head, that disipates quickly. The aroma is of sour cherries, dark caramel malts (raisins?), and mellow oak/bourbon. Wonderful. The flavor is well balanced between the sour/tartness from the cherries and the wild yeasts/bacteria and the deep caramel malts and vanilla like flavors from the barrel. The beer finishes with a tartness and slight tannic finish. The after taste is vanilla and sour cherries. I love this beer and this style. The mouthfeel is full yet not too big. This beer has many wine like properties in smell, taste and mouthfeel. This beer is extremely drinkable, but at 11% abv be careful. I could drink 10 of these no problem. I have to say that this is my favorite of the Lost Abbey yearly releases. Some of the special one-off sours are excellent, but I am really glad that this one is released every year.

The taste is a shocker, I knew this was a sour beer going into it but I was not expecting the sourness to be as strong as it was, and that was a good thing.

1143,"2008-12-01",4.4,"2008 375 ml cork-finished bollte.  Pours a dark mahogany brown with ruby red highlights.  No head at first from a soft pour, but a thin tan head forms when swirled.  The aroma is full of lovely cherry notes--dried cherry and concentrated cherry essence.  Following this is a hint of light sourness over a subtle malt base.  The flavor is full of clear tartness--both from fermentation and the cherry addition.  A malt foundational structure is there but is very well integrated along with a significant yet well balanced alcohol characteristic.  The barrel aging is quite evident as well which contributes a substantial amount of character in the form of woodiness and some slight pleasant oxidative elements.  The body, for containing 11% alcohol, is completely smooth and fully integrated, and leaves a long, lasting impression in the finish both in the mouth and soft palate.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
1143,"2008-11-29",4.0,"small ’08 bottle, from a trade. Rustic brown pour.. rich w/ lots of sediment (cherry skin? probably just yeast).. probably because of a rough car ride just before opening. Fragrant, sour-funk nose that does remind of the Giradin. small tan head. rich, funky taste that has some off-brett sweet sour. depth of the body definitely reminded me of the LA angel’s share ... this definitely tastes like a PP/LA beer, which is a wonderful signature. Cherries come through quite a bit (right up there with the red-wine grapes) with a nice sour-cherry on the lips. Good oakiness but not so much bourbon (which is alright by me). hides abv really well.

1143,"2008-11-29",4.2,"Thanks to luttonm for sharing a bottle. Pours a murky brown with very little head, and a *ton* of sediment - what looks like cherry peels. The room is immediately permeated with the smell of cherries when the cork is popped. The aroma is a cherry-infused tart citrus (lemon, with a bit of funk) - reminiscent of the Girardin gueuze. Tastes of a great old cabernet sauvignon - very, very musty - notes of old oak shine, and it tastes 10 years older than it is. Still, it has some bright notes like those of a champagne, but one made with red-wine grapes. It isn’t utterly fantastic, but it’s *very* good, and carries a wonderful novelty.

Really sour initial aroma, a bit of sour cherries and balsamic vinegar.  First impression upon sipping is of a strong malt base, with chocolate and some dark fruits, yielding to a lighter sourness, heavy with sour cherries and apple vinegar.   Nicely integrated flavor.  The malt is surprisingly strong here, the strong, heavy malt is a signature of most lost abbey brews I find, and it actually works kind of well with this one.  Some alcohol heat around the edges, which makes sipping a bit of a chore at times.  The finish is long and leans heavily on the light sour components.

Stepping into this one cautiously...aroma is very interesting and chameleon-like...it changes every time I go in for another try.  Picking up on the sour cherries each time, but also catching a caramel-malt like flavor, sweet bourbon, mild oak woods, raisins, and a white-wine like presence sitting on top of it all...very nice and gets a 11 for complexity.  Flavor takes you on a wonderful ride as well...initially extremely sweet, it almost instantly turns sour and bites hard with flavors of cherry, bourbon, oak, vanilla and a bit of leather.  However, after a couple seconds, it changes from sour back to sweet, and gives a plethora of dark fruit flavors mixed with brown sugar.  Ive never had a beer with such a strong sour character change back to a sweet finish like this...simply unique.  Smooth while being somewhat high on carbonation, but it fits the style of this beer very well.

1143,"2008-09-01",4.2,"2008 vintage, Sinners Club version.  The pour yields a dark and brooding ruby red body.  A very small, frothy, cream colored head settles to a lasting rim.  Soapy lace slowly glides down the glass, returning to the body.  The aroma is like a symphony of contrasting elements that somehow come together and agree to get along for the greater good.  Fruity elements include fermented boysenberries, pinot noir grapes, and tart cherry skins.  Oaky vanilla and the perfect bourbon kiss show the mastery of the barrel application.  Mild dark spicing and a dry, wild, bretty bite finish off the wonderful nose.  The flavor is considerably more tart than the aroma indicates, the sour cherries forcing themselves to the front of the line.  Dark raisons and soured berries emerge as the liquid rolls around the tongue.  Like the cherries, the bourbon influence is stronger in the mouth.  The oak is woody and sour, not as vanilla driven as one might expect.  Semi-dry on the palate, the substantial mouthfeel is very delicately carbonated.  The hefty ABV is noticeable, though not overbearing.  Overall, this is a fantastic brew, and perhaps the quintessential definition of the term ""hybrid"".  Equal parts Belgian Strong Ale, Sour Ale, Pinot Noir, and Sherry, all with a significant bourbon influence and a tart, bretty overtone.  Whatever you call it, I call it ""damn good.""","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The aroma is just amazing; bourbon, sweet fruit and tart cherries, vanilla, just tons stuff in here. The taste was surprisingly tart; sour cherries, whiskey and bourbon, some funk and yeast, raisins and more of that full tartness from barrel aged sour cherries. A full and medium thick mouthfeel.

Smell is really thick and spicy, with strong hints of alcohol.  There’s some cherries there if you smell hard.  Taste is unbelievably complex, unlike anything I’ve ever had before.  It’s very sweet at first, with strong hints of cherries that sort of last throughout the taste.  After the initial sweetness, it gets really tart fairly quick.  A lot of the spicyness alcohol from the nose is pretty much gone.  It finishes up a little bit smoky, or sort of oaklike, but not very strong.   Tastes almost like what I’d imagine a really good fruit wine to taste like.  Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation isn’t too high, and it’s not too thick, but it isn’t exactly watery either.

Pours a deep mahogany with a short lived off-white head that dissipated to a ring leaving no lacing.  Honestly, not the most impressive looking of beers.

This beer is massively aromatic and smells wonderful.  There is great balance of the oak and the sour cherries with a hint of alcohol burn as well, mainly bourbon.  All this on to of a sugary sweetness with some vanilla and candied sugar as well.

Taste is complex but very reminiscent of a sour belgian dark with the slightly acidic tartness of the cherries hitting up front with a bit of barnyard funk coming through as well.  The oak comes through in the finish and lingers in the aftertaste.  There are hints of the vanilla and sugar in the taste but less evident than the aroma would suggest.

I’ve got to admit I’m a little bit disappointed by this one, perhaps a first for Lost Abbey. Pours a gorgeous red-brown, like deep-stained wood, without much head. Nice aroma, lots of dry sour cherry and wood, just a hint of bourbon. But the brett comes on so hard in the flavor; it seems to overbalance everything that could be so good, the cherries and bourbon and subtle hints of dark fruit sugars. I guess maybe I’m trying to say that I’d rather have this one as a Belgian strong instead of a sour, given how much is going on within. The acidity is a bit too sharp on the tongue, the brett washes over a bit too much of the other complexities. The finish improves, as the depth of the beer is revealed -- but it’s already a bit too late and a bretty arrugula bitterness punishes the tongue as it searches for the warmth of the bourbon, the sugars from the raisins, the skins from the cherries.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Pours brownish amber, almost opaque, with a crimson tinge on the edges. Zero head or lacework. Perfectly clear legs on the glass.

Aromatics are intense and complex. Tart cherries, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, raisins, and a touch of balsamic. Plenty of boozy alcohol and sour fruit.

Medium bodied, a bit syrupy and chewy. Pretty much flat with a hint of carbonation.

A concentration of sour cherries, brandy, bourbon, and balsamic steeped raisins lead off the pallet. Warming and plenty of lingering sourness. A wine-like vineousity contrasts the boozy alcohol nicely. 
Dry and juicy, with plenty of oak and vanilla that struggle to follow through.

Finishes with lingering balsamic, cherry stones, and warming booze.

I dont like to reference other beers when reviewing, but the intense balsamic sourness reminded me of Earthmonk. Add the Cherries and the bourbon/brandy character and this beer is in a class by itself. 
I think Tomme needs to work on the carbonation issues of his beers though. If this beer was carbonated the aromatics would have been more intense, and the pallet could use some liveliness.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"
1143,"2008-06-05",3.9,"2008 Release; Sampled June 2008
A somewhat soft pour produces a 1/4-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a very dark, burnt-amber color that shows a lightly hazy, deep red color when held up to the light.  As I am pouring this beer I immediately notice aromas of Bourbon and oak as well as a rich fruitiness.  A more focused inspection of the aroma yields a sourness that is reminiscent of fruity balsamic vinegar, light Bourbon aromatics (including a bit of hot alcohol), ample barrel notes of spicy wood and buttery oak, some soft vanillin and a touch of something like an oaky zinfandel wine.  The Bourbon, while noticeable, thankfully does not completely overwhelm everything else.  Having said that it is hard to pick out the base beer notes from the overall barrel character.

Softly carbonated, but still a bit prickly; the carbonation is actually just about perfect for this big beer.  This is quite tart tasting, my mouth even puckers a bit as I take my first sip.  A tannic character seems to accentuate flavors of cherry skins and also coats the teeth and palate like a strong tea.  The barrel flavors contribute a soft, buttery oak component, just a touch of vanillin, and a lightly spicy woodiness as well as some light Bourbon notes; I like how light the Bourbon is in the flavor, it is much reduced compared to the aroma.  Pretty darn near bone dry tasting, it does have a viscous fullness to it that shows there is residual sugars & malt here, but this is almost completely tempered by the sourness and barrel flavors.  The finish has a touch of heat to it from the alcohol and barrel influences though it is somewhat soft.

As the beer warms up a bit some dry raisin flavors become more noticeable, essence of prunes also is found as is a noticeable tart cherry pulp flavor.  I really like how the sourness melds with the fullish body; the combination just seems to work quite well here.

This is probably a bit tastier than the black label (Russian River) version I had before this, but I get the feeling that prior versions achieved a closer-to-perfection result than this; such is the vagaries of experiments with bugs and barrels.  I look forward to sampling future vintages in the coming years.

Black Label, Sampled August 2005
4.1 7/4/8/4/18
Pours an opaque, deep amber color that shows bright, lightly murky ruby highlights when held up to the light.  The head is tan colored, frothy and fairly thin though it sticks around throughout the entire 750ml bottle.  The aroma is enticingly tart as soon as I pop the cork with notes of cherries.  As I go in for a deeper draught of the aroma the oaky bourbon barrel type notes.  There is a nice fruitiness under the barrel character; I get notes of raisins, figs, palm sugar, hints of molasses, tart cherries, vanilla, and caramel.  The aroma is quite complex, the more I smell the nose the more different scents and aromas come to the fore.  Quite a nice aroma.

The body on this beer is quite thick, though it finishes fairly light with a bourbon note.  The taste is tart and funky with notes of moist earth, musty leather.  The finish is lightly hot with alcohol, though this may be the barrel character more than the beer itself.  Again the beer is quite complex, this would age gracefully for many years (probably improving quite a bit) and I really wish I had another bottle of this.  This is definitely quite interesting, I am not too sure that the level of barrel character here is correct, I wish it was a bit more subtle so that I could taste the tantalizingly complex beer underneath.  Dont get me wrong this is quite good and quite enjoyable, I just wish that the barrel character was a bit less.  Having said that, as the beer warms up it starts to become a bit more in balance; the tart sourness (a mix of tart cherry and hints of rich balsamic vinegar) begins to reign in the barrel character.  This beer has enticing notes of toffee, a bit of molasses, whisky, bourbon, vanilla, and tannic oakiness.

This beer is quite complex, and that is what saves this beer in the end for me, there is so much going on with every sip it is just too intriguing, despite the heavy handed oak.  Up front I get some really sweet cherry notes, despite the fact that this beer is not really very sweet.  There is a thick maltiness here that gives a sort of rich sweet character.  As it is this beer is quite the experience, very worth spending an hour or two contemplating the flavors and complexity.  I need to get another bottle of this.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1143,"2008-06-05",4.0,"Thanks Tomme. I poured this into a 1.5 liter Chimay goblet and it created a wonderful yet shortlived pancake across the top leaving a sliky half moon lace. Its a dark brownish amber color. Aromas are a bit tart pushing green apple, minerals, and citric acid forward. From the bottle I can smell the cherries but not from the goblet. Medium nectar weight with good carbonation. This is very complex and completely defies my expectations. A dry style with bushels of green stonefruit just throwing themselves at me. Im getting nuances of cotton candy, popsickle, and cherry blush. Beautifully balanced, I never would have guessed the abv so high. Were starting to get into the Champagne genre with this one. The finish is beautifully bittered with acidity and has a lingering green apple cherry blush kicking it forward still.

Aroma of musty cherries and some woody bourbon barrel.  A fair amount of alcohol heat present in the nose. Taste is less cherry fruitiness and more of the boozy bourbon woodiness. Very dry. There is some tartness, but not much sweetness. As it warmed, more of the sweet and tart cherry came through. Boozy bourbon finish.

In long: The pleasant nose hints on sour oak flavours.  In mouth this is a fruit avalanche with red cherries, red apples,  all kinds of tropical fruits and a bunch of other ones.  Medium sweetness.  While not dry per say the beer is actually a lot dryer than when I expect from a 12% fruity Belgian ale and thats a good thing.  Seems to be some kind of dry/dusty yeast effect.  Medium sourness with equal parts of cherries and oak sensation.  Almost too drinkable for a 12% beer.  Unfortunately no brett sensation despite brett supposedly being used in the making of this beer.  No aging sign at all, if it wasnt for the 2005 indication on the bottle I would have thought this is a fresh beer.

1143,"2008-05-15",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2009 Pours a very dark brown, slight crimson tinge to it, and a small bubbly tan head that sticks around a while.  Upon smelling this, I wonder if theres anything other than sourness and cherries.  I was prepared for something less tart.  Eventually, the sourness and cherries give way to a lot of wood, old books, slight bourbon, raisins, and the faintest hint of toasty brown sugar malt.  Tastes as tart as the aroma suggest, but not as fruity.  Theres a HUGE tannin drying sensation on the tongue.  Beyond that, theres some wood flavor, over-steeped tea.  Finishes with lingering hints of vinegar, wood, toast, and red wiine.  Strong flavors no doubt, but its just so woody dry and a lot more tart than I wanted.  Creamy texture medium/full bodied and soft carbonation make this much chewier than any sour ale out there.  Its complex, but I could not get any malt flavors or balancing sweetness from this, so Im left unsatisfied.  Pass me some Judgement Day instead.

Incredible fruit notes; cherries, strawberries, raspberries and signs of dried fruit too. Some coca cola, coconut husks... shit the bed, its all over the place.

1143,"2008-03-22",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2008 The 2008 Lost Abbey version is less bourbony than my original tasting, but it is really funky, enteric, and acidic. Better than the original 3.7, but not by much. Does this beer ever settle into a clear pour?
Original: Bourbon aroma to the extreme. Sour (lactic) flavors intermingle with raisins, bourbon, wet bread. Quite boozy. Delicious, but it really has too much bourbon flavor. Thanks, Ken, for bringing his MJ Rare Beer Club offering.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1143,"2008-03-17",4.7,"I got one bottle from Zathrus13 and one from fordest.  First I need to say I loved that beer from the first time I had the chance to try it.  This was on December 3rd 2005 at the Strong Ale Festival in Carlsbad which was supposed to be from what I heard the wildest version (red foil).  Then I had a second chance to try it at a local ratebeer tasting. That time it was the silver or the black foil (cant remember which one exactly).  So here we come with this first lost abbey release  Pours dark brown with no carbonation or any head what so ever.   The nose is intense!  Decadent caramel, molasses, raisins with strong woody and brett/lacto aroma.  I would smell this one for hours!  This is a very complex with all kinds of flavors all well integrated together; sweet and sour (actually sourer then I remembered) with strong cherry and oak character.  I could not resist to the temptation of pouring the dregs to my second batch of ABT aging with brett Lambicus.  I will keep the second bottle for a later tasting and hopefully I will be able to put my hands on a bottle of the next release so I can make some comparison. Many thanks Jeff and Sean for these two bottles!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","FrancoisMtl"

I mean reading it doesnt do it justice, you gotta taste it. An aroma of sour cherries, sitting in a chocolate rum/wine sauce. It really is decadent smelling like a fine dessert. Appearance is dark brown in color, opaque with a small white head with quick dissipation. Flavors are sour cherries, chocolate, raisins, dark rum, old leather....all wrapped up incredibly well.

Moderately sweet, lightly bitter flavour.  The bitterness disappears fastly, while the sweetness stays.  Port like.  Very nice, but not that much as beer.  Anyway I dont mind too much.

1143,"2008-02-17",4.9,"Big thanks to metallitone1 for the bottle. Nice corked and caged bottle, pours totally still. Color is woody red. Aroma is complex with vanilla, fruit, and oak. The barrel-aging seems to contribute a spicy and toasty aroma.
  Cherry and raisiny fruit flavors abound in the taste. Vanilla, red wine, and bourbon weave a nice pattern throughout this beer. The wild yeast is smoothly integrated into the overall flavor profile. Full, coating mouthfeel. Drinkability is limited only by the extremely low availability.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Sephiroth"

Unique, interesting and delicious.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
1143,"2008-02-08",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2008 Bottle at Monks café  not sure of the vintage at the moment (its the one with the dark colored label and the big ""C"")This one pours a dark red with almost no head.  Aroma is a huge and wonderful mix of strong, tart cherries, bretty-sweet sourness, bourbon and vanilla notes, Cabernet Sauvignon and some assorted funky scents.  Flavor has a nice bretty funk and sourness with a strong sour cherry taste.  Also some woody, oaky, bourbon, and quality red wine (Zin, Cab) thrown in here plus some alcohol hotness.  Mouthfeel is thick with a nice pucker factor.  The biggest drawback is the alcohol taste and overall heat  Im guessing it needs more time.  Points for originality and overall taste and presentation, but this doesnt match the best brett beers Ive had  namely Cuvee de Castleton and Supplication.  Damn good!  I will definitely lay away my bottles from Patron Sinners for a bit, as I think they will improve quite a bit with a little time.

Re-rate of a 2008 bottle:  Well, this does it - its prettier, heartier with a great oaky-vanilla-bourbon sweetness in aroma and flavor.  Lots of vinous fruits and cherries in a blend that is nothing short of amazing.  Awesome feel.  Tomme took a really good beer and made it truly great.  Wow.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
1143,"2008-01-05",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2008 Tasted many times over the years.  Mind boggling and unique, but Ive usually preferred the Mother of All Beers base beer.  Copper brown color; aroma of big sour persimmon and other funky fruit, cherries, wine and bourbon wood flavors.  Like taking a framboise and going off the deep end.  Flavors of tongue twisting sour strange tropical fruit, persimmon...some versions without aging may be a tad syrupy, harsh, acidic, alcoholic, yet still intense, intriguing and fun.  Not for the timid.  The 05 is a real standout right now.","LA, California, USA","DenverLogan"

1143,"2007-11-22",4.8,"Bottle courtesy hapjydeuce to whom Im deeply appreciative of for this gem, which did nothing but exceed my already high expectations. The pour was burgundy-purple to brown in color, thin initial head, barely stuck around, quit flat looking, near nil lacing, terrible if comparing to Belgian strongs, but to be expected if thinking about Flemish Sours, especially one of this strength. The aroma was wonderful cherries, wine, funky brett. The flavor was cherries, wine, sour cherries, slight barnyard, grapes, funky, some dark fruits, slight hints oak. What  wonderful concoction to behold and consume, so worth the wait, hopefully a wait which wont be as long before my next one. Mouthfeel was firm and full bodied, but thinned a little by the acidity. Thanks again, Justin!","","User37895"
1143,"2007-11-08",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 5, 2008 November 2007.  375 ml bottle, vintage 2007.  Thanks, Zac!  Resembling an out of body experience.  Chocolate brown and very muddy pour. Still, with a glint of glassy brandy shade around the edge.  Bretty balsamic aroma with delicate sweet shades of toasted oak, smooth creme brulee and vanilla; sour cherries, peppery gueuze, mint and dark chocolate.  Bottomless.  Raspberry, funk.  Flavor is truly, without equivocation or exaggeration, absolutely unique.  Tartness right away slices through with a jagged precision, carving out a dry cherry skin and old orange rendering.  Spicy sensations spark with brilliant restraint; white pepper, cinnamon.  Apple, raisin, goat cheese; pure, intangible, transcendent complexity.  Cherry plays with sweet wood, spruce tips and that dry rub of chocolate for a bewilderingly unique impression.  Tangy, dark, and imposing.  Warmth reveals a quieted sweetness in maple, honey and melon.  Full and lively palate, wherein the heavy malt and the bite of brett hum in a tight and practiced harmony.  Pulses with a blast of lemon juice, pure cocoa, and mint leaves, though this blossoms with the slow intensity of autumn, arriving with a calculated delay for an ideal effect.  Fully unique and sophisticated, yet personable and accessible; a complete and stunning tour de force of imagination.  9/4/10/5/19 4.7 August 2008.  Poured from a 375 ml bottle, vintage 2008, thanks to Ty.  Clear mahogany pour; glassy and gorgeous.  Chocolate and candied almond aroma, cut with sharpness of apple cider vinegar, the tart sweetness of golden raisins.  A tight vanilla oakiness and a beautiful textured bitterness of vine fruit tannins.  It’s emotive capacity is limitless.  The flavor is somewhat more constrained by its youth, seemingly.  Big cherry juice and licorice-like cola sweetness, balanced in earthy bitterness of herbs and semisweet chocolate.  Some green, lightly alcoholic, and briefly hit with a toasty bourbon-toned sweetness of coconut and wood.  Cherries and sugars open up in the nose a bit more with warmth.  A confounding mineral character blending with the cherry tannin in the yeast pour.  Gravelly and funky, and left a bit loose.  It doesn’t wrap together as well as it might in a few more months.  Sourness rushes forth.  It’s still feathery and soft in flavor, but the brett is biting a little.  Heavy and soothing complex palate; full, and careful in warmth; finish is lengthy, and showing some bourbon-like brown sugar, on cherries and somewhat plain wood.  Still a fabulous idea of a beer, although this vintage is a bit young yet. 9/4/8/4/15 4.0","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1143,"2007-11-02",4.4,"The beer poured a nice deep brown color with a slight tan head. This beer definitely has the look and aroma of a nice fruity Port. The taste was of a nice low carbonated, earthy brew with slight taste of oaking from the aging process. The 12% abv makes this a nice dessert drink to sip on and that is how I had it.

With sour cherries, oak, lactic acid, grapes, and a lot of wine especially as it warms.  The carbonation is lively and much more enjoyable than the last vintage.

1143,"2007-09-30",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2008 Same beer as the Aug. 25th 2007 Barrel Tasting event except this time it has been in a bottle for a while. Pours hazy brown copper with thin tan head. It has a big fruity complex aroma with a layer of tartness, cherries, cherries and more cherries. I also get barrel wood notes and it is smelling rich and inviting. As big a flavor as the nose led onto, wow. Lots of cherries that quickly become tart and leaning up against a wood barrel (yes, a cherry leaning on a barrel, thats what it tastes like. How can my taste buds be wrong?). This is bold in flavor with the tartness building and building into the finish. Nice refreshing brew bringing up sweet fruity cherries turning tart and then theres an undercurrent of a wood note that sneaks in every so often. Ends with lingering cherry fruitiness and tartness.
It seems much more tart than when I tasted straight from the barrel last year at the Barrel Tasting event.
Tasted at Lost Abbeys 1st Annual Barrel Tasting (Aug. 25, 2007) pours like a port wine or coffee with a reddish tint. The aroma is big consisting of oak, green grapes, raisins, dates, a little bit of hay and new freshly wetted burlap. The flavor stacked up much the same way as the aroma. The fruitiness is rich, somewhat sweet and inviting with green grapes, plums, dates, raisins and hints of fresh boysenberries. Well, sort of boysenberry-ish. The fruit notes were melded nicely together making them tough to discern yet they were also punchy in their evenness. To round out the flavor mellow notes of oak and vanilla mix effortlessly with the fruit.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1143,"2007-09-14",4.3,"2003 vintage. The resounding glow from a dark cherry red pour is gorgeous, one of the prettiest expressions of my favorite color scheme in a beer I have encountered. The body has transparent liquid spots intertwined with twirling haze, glittering carbonation streaming upward. The mid-sized light beige head with dark tan swirls recedes slowly and imparts bold circular lacing that slowly drips downward. Brettanomyces roars from the glass as its lifted for the first nosing. Fresh cherries, multi-varietal and both tart and decadently sweet, follow and release crafty hints of sugar-coated chocolates and raw oak. Belgian yeast is glorious and even-tempered, forcible while exuding elegance only an unadulterated strain from that country produces. Caramelized brown sugar and figs are next, sharp tangents shooting from each glimpse into this incredibly complex offering. Traces of rock sugar comliment the oak and sour/tartness and bring up the rear. This is a vinous and reluctantly authentic aroma, pleasing and challenging. The flavor is extremely vinous and sharp, with yeast in the corners and sour brawling with sweet in the middle of the ring. Rum raisin cake is introduced early. Sour levels are high, tartness puckering and bulbous, sweetness medium and spices from yeast and barrel alike are boorish and popping. Astringency is high and though it has mellowed(18 month old sample) its still a kick in the teeth. Woodiness now takes on an earthy character, completed with a musty outlook and a focused inward tannic swirl that grabs hold and migrates into dark recesses in the corners of the mouth. Alcohol is marvelously masked until a pounding and unforgiving finish takes its first step towards the inevitable ingraining effect it will hold in memory for years to come. Warmth grows as sharp vinous notes glide freely down the throat and back up again, this time with sharper astringency, moderately drying out the entirety of the affected area. Sour cherry pits and sugar lingers. The mouthfeel is light-medium, with silky carbonation and spongy fruit syrup in tightly wound pockets that bounce around inside the mouth. The ultra-extraordinary vinous character and similarities to a very old Super-Tuscan red wine are what make a carefully cellared sample of this beer most unforgettable. Delicious, though young samples have proven less enticing. One to buy and forget about for awhile.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

07 bottle - Poured a dead ruby-brown color with zero head.  Nice tart cherry and oak aromas meld nicely.  The palate is moderately thick, with little carbonation.  Taste was not as sour as expected, but the sourness complimented the cherry character very well.  

The 05 sample was quite a bit more sour than the 07.  It seemed the sourness made the brew a little more uneven , but it still was great.  The 05 was amply carbonated, and this allowed easier appreciation of the aroma.  

The only real flaw the 07 had was the carbonation issue.  A well-carbonated bottle would certainly gain a few points.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
1143,"2007-07-19",4.2,"#300.  750ml, black bottle from 2005 along with a new, 2007 375ml bottle tasted consecutively.  Highly anticipated beer for me, thanks to those who shared. The 2005 pours a red, brown color with a small off-white head.  Aroma is very similar to a Flemish Sour.  Very sour with a healthy touch of vinegar.  Not many other characteristics detectable underneath.  Taste is tart, very sour, cherries, a bit of alcohol, and the good old Flemish Sour stuff thrown in for good measure.  A very strong and intensely sour experience.  The newer, 07 bottle (which has some awesome artwork, by the way) pours red/brown with no head or carbonation whatsoever.  Aroma is tart, sour, appetizing, surprisingly mild, chocolate.  Taste is balanced, delicious, nicely tart and sour but very rounded.  Comparing the two vintages the 07 is much more subtle and soft on the palette.  More complex and rounded and much, much less sour.  They were both great beers but Id put the 07 above the 05 by a decent amount.  Much more enjoyable to me.  Lives up to the hype and Id love to see how the new bottle matures over the next few years.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
1143,"2007-07-15",4.6,"Near perfection.  Great thanks to Bartzilla.  This 375ml bottle seems small but packs perfect alcohol content and enough enjoyment in every sip to leave one forgetting all worldly ills.  Many great reviews.  I will add I thought the aroma was not as strong as I would have liked.  While drinking the smells did not fully drift to the nose.  Thats about my only complaint.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","GaltScat"
1143,"2007-07-15",4.2,"This was the black label 05 version.  Courtesy footbalm.  Thanks Eric!  Pours a cloudy dark maroon with a small, light tan head.  Smells pretty tart and sour.  Some dark fruits, citrus, and malts make up the rest of its aroma.  The taste is very complex.  The acidity and malts blend together nicely coating the palate.  Not extremely sour, but just enough to let you know its there.  The main fruits I get are cherries and sour apples.  Nice lengthy finish with a sweet aftertaste.  This was a damn fine brew.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
1143,"2007-07-02",4.0,"375 ml bottle thanks to Padrefan98 shared with willblake and Dickinsonbeer. Poured an incredibally flat deep reddish/brown with no head at all. Even after some vigirous agitation I could not get even the tiniest bit of head. Aroma was tart, funky and seemed to be chocolate covered cherries soaked in alcohol. The body was smooth and the alcohol was totally hidden especially at 11%. Flavor was very nice with initial sweetness a tart aftertaste and lots chocolate covered fruit flavors in between. Excellent beer thanks for this one Jon.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
1143,"2007-07-02",4.3,"Following its base, the ""Mother of All Beers"", the black-labeled Cuvée de Tomme was an exciting event. Similar in color, the dark body gleamed with a raspberry tinge, presumably reddened by the added cherries. Above, a thick beige foam is strongly erected. Cherries reappear on the nose, sour and juicy, initiating a complex string of scents that seemingly blends the classic Flemish Red components with a deeper and darker foundation. Brown sugar and a profusion oak-induced vanillin add to the rapidly snowballing aroma. This explosive bouquet suggests marshmallow, fig newtons, white chocolate, macadamia nuts, notes of caramel and cinnamon, blueberry and even garlic. An eclectic and exhilarating blend that begs for a sip. I dont hesitate to indulge. Starting with milk chocolate covered cherries, the flavor comprises a resonating mid-range of whipped cream, vanilla, hazelnut, cardamom and raspberry, finishing with a sweet woody flavor and a hint of teriyaki. The aftertaste is sweet and sour, a long-lasting malty cherry flavor. Unique, to say the least, I found the sourness amplified and more appropriate than it was in the Mother of All Beers. An exceptional brew overall, daring but balanced, creative, and very rewarding for those who can endure chasing the elusive.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
1143,"2007-06-18",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2008 2008 vintage.  Still pours dark red/brown/black.  No head at all.  Really pretty much exactly prior rating.  No change.


The Lost Abbey version shared by BBB63.  The beer pours dark red/brown/black, depending on how it is held to the light.  The only signs of head is the slight ring around the edge.  Aromas of black cherry (comes of Jolly Rancher-ish), soy sauce,  slight musty basement, and a touch of alcohol.  The flavor is nice and fruity.  Loads of tart cherry and plums.  Warm alcoholic finish.  Silk and oil over the palate.  Moderate carbonation.  This is less like a beer and more of a wine or high end liquor.  Thanks a million Mike.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
1143,"2007-06-15",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2010 I got to try this again from a 2008 bottle thanks to thedm and hotstuff.  Whatever issues I had with a previous version they either fixed or I got over.  This was one amazing beer.  Intoxicating aroma of rich cherries with flavors of sour cherry, vanilla, wood and a little sour pinch that stayed within the cherry flavor.  Lots of acid, but well balanced with just a hint of funk.  Really amazing beer.

6-15-07  Out of the new Lost Abbey bottle from C-Bus 7.  Dark amber beer with no head at all.  Tangy Brett nose of funky wet hay.  Im not a fan of sour beers, but this was not awful.  Sour cherry, wood, oak, rotten oragne peel, and a long funky rotten hay finish.  Not as bad as I feared, but still a beer to drink with full knowledge of what it is.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

1143,"2007-06-09",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2007 Tried at OBriens, who was generously selling bottles to drink at the bar.  My wife was also generous enough to let me drink on her birthday, today.  Sampled with a Judgement Day as a comparison.  Judgement day is the base beer for CdT.  They look the same, and you can taste many underlying similarities, but then the CdT takes over and rules.  The aroma of cherries is wonderful, but not overpowering like Lindemans.  Very well mellowed from aging.  Perfect balance of sweetness and mild tartness.  Very drinkable, despite the unnoticable 11% alchohol.  A truly well rounded spectacular beer.  Oh, I wish I could drink it everyday. 4.4, should be be a 4.5?, probably.
   Tried again at the Lost Abbey 1st Annual Barrel Tasting.  Without aging CdT smells like a young red wine.  Deep Red Black color.  As if enough red could become black.  Very tart also like a young red.  After barrel aging, the aroma and flavor differences are amazingly different.  Wonderful full oak in the aroma.  Tartness has faded.  A bit of buttery caramel sweetness that I like.  Still is better in the bottle with carbonation and a slight chill.
   12/30/07:  Tried a 2003 vintage from deftim13.  First bottling, but second year of the beer.  unnumbered, but labeled CVNV3:  CuVee North Vinyard 2003.  No pop. Uncarbonated.  Burnt amber color.  This bottle was stored in the cellar below PP Solano untouched until now.  Was told this is sourer than others, but it didnt seem extra sour to me.  11.5% is unnoticable.  Lot of sour cherry aroma.

1143,"2007-05-27",3.8,"Rating #900. 375 fresh bottle from Moejuck. Pours completely, totally dead flat. Id wonder if there were something wrong but other people mentioned it, so I dunno. Aroma is lightly tart cherries, raspberry, chocolate malts and hot alcohol. Not too much complexity. Taste is much bigger, bustling with activity, dark breadiness/pumpernickel and warm malts up front, raspberries along the side of the tongue and a dry, slightly chalky finish. Very chewy and filling with little heat in the taste. Muddled wine and grains skirt the tongue at the fore. I must admit, Im pretty disappointed with this. It really, really needs some carbonation. One of the most appealing attributes of fruited beers like this is the spritziness they gain from the carbonation, almost like a highly complex and rich soda. This is completely missing that, and really I dont think its that complex, either. With carbonation this probably wouldve done 4.2 or so. Ive got a black label 750 sitting in the cellar, well see how that one goes.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

1143,"2007-05-16",4.3,"COMPLETLY FLAT. I bought this at there 1st aniv. Not that it must have a head or anything like that, but just a tiny bit of bubbles to bring out that amazing aroma. I mean just a tiny head, wouldve made this beer a perfect 5!. Also i would catagorize it as a BSA. Its much more of a Kriek/Lambic a Flemish Sour or even a Barleywine. The flavors in this liquid are pure heaven... In order of apperance are: Sour Cherries, Peaches, Vanilla, Oak, Yeast, Raisins, Plums, tobacco, lactobacilus, earth and champagne... and that was just the first sip! It matures changes and gets even more complex as you keep trying to figure out whats in this. The palate, apart from the obvious lack of life, is actually pretty smooth and velvety, no alcohol noticeable but it does give more of a wine palate than an ales.

The taste is bold complex and and ill agree with my fellow san diegan padrefan who I finally met at the event, that the taste has cherries, plums and apricots.  It is sour but also pleseantly sweet.  It leaves a remarkable feeling on the inside of the mouth.  There is also a bit of a vinous red wine/sangria quality at the end of the taste.

1143,"2007-05-07",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2009 375mL Bottle. May 2007 Release. Rosy rich, brandied nose of caramelized fig and walnut puree, jamming with a balsamic and strawberry coulis, swiftly tart and citric with stunning clarity and piquant musk. Could use some more strength and softness, but a beautiful floral bouquet nonetheless. The color of this beer is the most handsome blood red liquor alive, with capitulating fringes of gold and sunset orange. Rimmed in a tinted crisp line of goatskin. Deeply cored in crystalline clear ruby. Ah, heavenly carbonation. Wow, rushing a multitude of cataclysmic flavors upon the palate in unhurried abyss. A puckering Lambic sourness brightens up the front end with a totality of cherry juice and wildness. Acidity rise and evaporates into the sinuses, leaving a sheen of caramelized rum raisin cake on the roof of the mouth. The best part of this beer is the duality of both sourness and heavy-handed Belgian malt sugar. Truly the best of both worlds. Drying out towards the backend, with only slight alcoholic burps of heat. A peep of oxidation sidles in with an aged out EKG-like touch, which somehow seems out of place with this beer. Maybe I would have appreciated fully aged hops instead of the tired base beers hops? Theres some peculiar indescribable funk laying heavy on the smack. Subtle, yet active carbonation keeps the flavors popping on the tongue. The acidity on top of the largeness of the beer helps pare down the heat and barrel character. I could see how this could get rampantly over-acidic with time or barrel mismanagement. Faint edges of acetone. Lots of tangible acid notes, from fresh blood orange reduction, to palpable freshly squeezed Ruby Red Grapefruit and some musty 10-year balsamic. Everything melds so fantastically. I think it has the best unified flavor, having been borne of some many individual components. Big fermented Belgian, Sour Cherries, Brett, Barrel and time. All these elements melt together into an alchemical magic that makes this beer what it is. I can compare it only to Rodenbach Alexander, with this beer I pine for a little more cherry complexity and some earthiness from pits. Bravo Tomme. Im glad to be able to give this a full workout without having been totally inebriated.
2001 North Vineyard. 750mL. Originally reviewed 5/7/2007. 5/10/5/10/20=5.0 Tomme produces an unlabeled bottle with cryptic Sharpie markings on the cap. According to him, an unreleased early vintage. Pouring into the glass a cherubic Indian ruby sapphire, glowing with clear glassy edges and a blood rim. Aroma carries one away into an overwhelming presence of intense red fruits from across the board, cherries and raisins percolate in the core of my brain. So bright, alive and refined. Absolutely stunning. Finally passing my lips, this lubricious liquid takes form as a mindnumbing shapeshifter. What first presents itself as a unmarked, world class malt and fruit chimeric belgian strong ale, quickly cloaks itself in a world of sourness. The best of both worlds! Trying to parse out the intricate corners of the beer, Im at a loss, its all too much. Rodenbach Alexander quickly comes to mind. The fruit character so deft, real and upfront. Palate couldnt be more satisfying, yet exacting. Ill rate again with a bottle of the current batch, but I needed to expunge my thoughts with this rarest of gems.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

1143,"2007-04-28",4.0,"25 oz bottle, black label, via trade w/ someone a long time ago that I cant recall now.  Pours a very dark garnet to ruby colored body under a fizzy and foamy one finger beige head that faded to a partial covering.  The aroma is all over the place.  Chocolate, cherry, light brett, heavy fruitiness, alcohol, plum, light oak, almost reminiscent of some Flemish Sours.  The flavor is still quite fruity up front with lightly tangy sour cherry and bretty funkiness.  Finishes with oak, a ton of alcohol, whiskey, and a dry lingering brettiness.  My only problem is that there is way too much alcohol flavor on the finish for me, which is enhanced by the whisky/oak flavor that reinforces the booziness of it.  Extremely warming sensation on the finish.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and really almost bordering on sticky and cloying, but the fizzy champagne-like brett derived carbonation really cuts through it making it quite lively.  Very fine pinpoint carbonation.  This was really tasty and loaded with flavor, but I couldnt stop wishing that the ABV was about 5% lower.  With all the fruit, brett, and the barrel aging they just didnt need to use an 11% ABV base beer.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Flavor is dry and mildly tart with the cherries presenting themselves first, followed by some maple syrup, dark fruit, yeast, and a bit of alcohol. Not as sour as I thought it would be... instead, the sourness is really more of a strong tartness.  However, Im left wondering if the sourness is supposed to be the lead flavor, a background player, or somewhere in between.  A complex and dry beer, but prehaps a bit too yeasty and far removed from the more traditional Belgians Im used to for me to consider it world class.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Thanks to hezron for bringing this to the tasting.  This started a string of several excellent beers that capped off the night.  Unfortunately it also started to unsettle my stomach as well.  I guess the average body is not designed to drink so much brett in a single sitting.  Anyways, on to the show.
Aroma / Appearance - Cherry, oak, fruity esters and a sour nutty feel complete a very well balanced nose.  Unlike some of the earlier beers which just seemed odd with brett, this one fit like a glove.  The body poured a deep amber with no carbonation.
Flavor / Palate - A tart sour mouthfeel begins the pleasure.  Vinous, it also dries out the mouth at the same time.  The finish reminds me of a strong bourbon that warms the palate.  It is a great sipping beer - I cant imagine anyone finishing a whole 750 of this on their own.

1143,"2006-11-12",2.6,"Black label version.  Very dusty, murky brown.  Nose is very tart and vinegary, quite sour.  Also herbal and weedy, some sour fruit, smells qutie intriguing.  Flavor is agressively not pleasant, extremely acidic and tart, basically tastes like a big glass of balsamic vinegar.  Add to that the fact its undercarbonated and this isnt much fun.

Nice level of sourness: tart cherries, medium acidity (shows through on the finish), pleasant vanilla and oak.  Long vinuous cherry finish.  Awesome beer.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1143,"2006-11-05",4.8,"Enjoyed a sample of this one from a 750ml boittle at the Tasting in the Woods Part Deux. This beer was phenomenal.  Pours to a deep ruby red to brown color, with a rocky, beige head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantatic, with lots of big oaky aroma, paired with aroma of sour cherry. The plate is firm on the tongue, with lots of rich malt, paired with wild, yeasty flavors, and flavors of sour cherry. This beer finishes with more complex and delicious flavors of oak, yeast, and cherry, and ends with a refreshing sour cherry flavor that lingers. The ultimate aperitif, or desert beer, this beer is a true master piece of the brewers art.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
1143,"2006-10-31",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2007 From a 750mL Bottle, 2003 Vintage.  Deep brown, almost blackish pour with a ruddy tinge and a thin white layer of head.  Tantalizing, port-like aromas of ripened figs and raisins - very vinous, very sweet, but a smidgen of tart fruitiness at the same time heightens the senses.  Some under-ripe raspberries and cherry pits add to the aromatic complexity.  Wow, this is a big, rich beer.  Full bodied, almost syrupy mouthfeel with a gentle carbonation.  The dark fruits and sweet port/sherry like qualities really grabbed me the most in the aroma, but the brett complexities take over on the palate.  Red grapes, oak, and leather overwhelm my tongue, creating a rich, powerful balance between vinous, woody, and brett characters.  A hint of chocolate, raspberries, more port, and leathery cherry skins all seem to be concentrated in this vinous elixir.  Incredibly unique, rich, vinous beer thats equally creative and fantastic.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
1143,"2006-10-31",4.2,"Bottled.  I had this where it happend to be brewed.  A chance offering to share with the departure of a good apprentice.

Wonderful aromas of the oak that it was aged in.  So much fuit and sour to appease a yearning palate.  Deep notes of color and mouth feel.  Rich and complex from the burbon barrel it was aged in.  The Brettanomyces catches you immediatly in the nose. Cherries in the mixture make for a kindness to the senses.

Do not be surprised.  This aged ale is Sour.  Just as was intended.

1143,"2006-10-04",4.0,"GABF 06. Another winner. Beer was clear, dark brown with an average-sized, frothy, beige, mostly diminishing head. The aroma was Flemish Sour Ale-like; funky and pointy in all of the right places. It was malty with a light note of toasted grain and caramel; Hoppy with a light lemon zest note, moderate note of herb/grass; Yeasty with a trace of dank basement a moderate note of barnyard; Moderate sour cheer, sweet balsamic and strawberry notes sparkled through the back. The flavor was heavily acidic, lightly bitter, light-to-moderately sweet with a longish, lightly acidic, tounge piquing, lightly sweet finish. Lots of intriguing coconutty retros. The body was light, the texture was watery and the carbonation was lively. Again... must find more.

Aroma of oak, cherries, and sour brett.  Sourness is mild to moderate though, I must say, I was expecting more.  I think the sourness is perfect.  Flavor is oaky, sour, cherry, there is almost a chocolate note in there, and its pretty dry.  Overall its really good, and I wasnt expecting to like this beer.

Nasty looking!  Sludgy brown, explosive diarrhea, with a couple of bubbles.  At least it didnt have any protein chunks, it would have scored even lower!  It reminds me of every time I go to the States and eat American junkfood, Taco Bell for instance, I always get the runs, like my body rejects it and decides to give my colon a backwash as punishment.  Thats why I stick to places like Whole Foods, although the attraction is just too great and I always end up caving in!  Anyways, you get my point, back to the Beer.
Well maderized, roasted pecans, cherries macerated in that spicy vodka whos name escapes me, it was like NG Belgian red on cristal meth.  I even smelled a bit of curry in there! Whoh!
Excellent body, the cherries and acidity make a wonderful balancing act, the murky, yeasty funk is there and the alcohol is solid and warming at the end.  Really not much to look at, but if you can look beyond that its a phenomenal Beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

Boozy body with a prominent alcohol kick, plenty of tannic oak and vanilla, and strong tartness of brie cheese rind.

The oak imparts the vanilla and the nutmeg, which altogether blends for a phenomenal Belgian. Id drink this over the Abbaye des Rocs series any day.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
1143,"2005-11-14",3.3,"Thick & mahogany colored with a large initial head that settles to a brown, oily film. Rich caramel & bourbon woodsiness in aroma (very lovely). High on alcohol & sweetness with mild vinegar notes. Predominantly sour & odd in flavor with cherries and Brett stealing the show. Vinous and sour... nothing like the Belgian Strong Ales that I enjoy (<a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/Beer/Beer-Rat Draak, <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/Beer/Beer-Rat Island 1800 Demolition, <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/Beer/Beer-Rat the Beast, etc.)
After all of the hub-bub Id heard surrounding this beer, I found it a neccessity to sample (and I encourage others to do the same.) I applaud the brewers in their skill and innvovation, yet a beer is a work of art, open to interpretation and depedent upon the palate of the patron. I appreciate this beer as I appreciate the works of Rothko, Pollock, Picasso, Christo, et. al.: Skillfully manipulated, bold, avant garde and well-presented... yet the finished work falls short of and does not appeal to my personal tastes.

Highly complex and utterly stunning.  Dark red-brown color, largely opaque with a thoroughly solid head.  Flavor profile is equally massive and satisfyingly intricate; tart, alcoholic, fruity and moderately sweet, plenty of cherry and milky chocolate, some faintly citric orange and berry throughout with a big, tart finish, somehow quenching and ""moreish"" despite the strength.

Moderately sweet, moderate to heavily acidic finish.  OH SWEET ERIS, this is delicious.  Its...its...like an imperial Flemish sour.  Ive died and gone to heaven.

The creamy and thick beige head slowly diminishes and lasts throughout the entire bottle (and believe me I took my time enjoying this one).  The aroma is alcohol, cherries, grains, sweet cherry pie, burnt cinnamon, roasted nutmeg, sweet lime, pineapple, distinct brettanomyces scents, sweet caramel just for a brief instant, bourbon, wood and a hint of cocoa.  The taste is syrupy sweet in feel, though is only sweet for a brief second before  nice lightly acidic tannis take over.  Theres notes of obviously real cherries (not artificial syrup), apple, oak, lemon, pine, grapefruit, maple, black pepper, chocolate, bitter roast, and heavy bourbon notes.  The alcohol and harsh bourbon is noticable in the taste, not to the point where its offensive, but to the point where it gets in the way of some other flavors.  I have heard the earlier versions of this dont quite have the same bourbon barrel pungency.  Either way this is what I have to taste and Ive tasted better examples of barrel aging.  Medium-full bodied, medium-lively carbonation (natural, small & crisp bubbles), surprisingly dry on the palate.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

Sour, without the vinegar aroma - like unripe cherry.  Aroma is slowing building to tartened height of majesty.  The first sip of the 2003 Silver was full and chewy.  The cherry is evident.  2005 Gold is much more dense, and the palate is lively, with apple being more evident.  All are conditioned  by a salted leather element  that gives a distinct charm.

First sip starts with lots of tart cherry - but its fruitier and lighter than expected. Theres oak and a bit of malt. Lighter bodied than expected. It turns into a nice refreshing beer with some sweetness and a good tart cherry flavor with some background chocolate. Its good, but I wish it had a little more body and more at the end instead of finishing very dry.

Flavor bursts with more black cherry, wine cask, light cork, sherry hints.  Alcohol burn and great acid astringency, at times somewhat chalky.

Michael opens the Cuvee and we find that it has gone into secondary fermentation spewing foam from the bottle. Get a plate to rest this beer on and we did save and then savor every drop of this prized liquid. 
The liquids body is a rusty hue of amber and the head is middling shade of tan. The aroma consists of beautiful submissions of toasted oak and raw sour cherries. How I love the earthy acidic off put from the brettanomyces yeasts. The flavor is immensely oaked. Soured wood vanilla bean Bourbonthe cherries are huge raw compote red wine vinegar I see this as a Sour Red Ale rather than a Belgian Strong. The boldness of Gueuze is present. The tart dryness of spiced cider. and more oak. AMAZING! One of the best beers I have had to this date! Absolutely Incredible!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

1143,"2005-06-29",4.2,"What an experience popping the cork!  It just flowed and flowed, for a bottle that had settled for a long time.  This beer was like a game of cat-and-mouse: it was possible to hold one layer of the beer in your mind for a few moments, but once you started thinking about the next layer--none of the layers were hard to pick out--it was difficult to keep the previous one in your mind.  The big three layers here are the kriek/sour, the Belgian ale (a quad it seemed?), and the barrel aging.  The aroma gave a lot of the barrels in particular, with a bit of whisky and a note that struck me like Grandpas cheap cologne (Brut or something like that).  The sour cherry edge was found on the palate in particular.  Hazy chestnut color, moderate head.  This was a beer of brewing brilliance in its complexity; in truth, I enjoyed the Mother of All Beers (the base beer for this one) a bit more--even though the Mother is not the achievement of beer, like a Monet to a Rembrant, I responded a bit more fully to the striking appeal of the single dimensions, rather than the multi-layered quality that was interesting and engaging but toying.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

1143,"2005-06-20",4.1,"A very unique experience.  I had no idea what I was in for when I started to try these various years and foils.  It was most memorable.  To begin, I was first given a sample of 2003 silver foil.  Poured a deep brown with brick red hints.  Very dark and opaque.  The aroma was tart with deep fruit (I noted plum and fermented grapes).  The flavor was sour and tart.  Very crisp with lots of fruit (lemon, peach, and grapes).  A veritable fruit cocktail.  The body, as Ive stated, was quite crisp.  This is the one I rated at 4.1.

Next up was the 2004 Silver.  This one poured a bit hazier and more brick red than the previous year.  The aroma had some chalky tartness, and a swear I smelled some brine hiding in there.  The flavor of this was even more intensely sour and tart than the 2003 (not surprising I guess).  Again, I noted many fruit flavors.  This time I noted Lemon, pear and grape.  Full of fruit.  The body was light and crisp.  Jen said it was deliciously fruity.  Full of berries, white peach, nectarine, and green fruit.  Lastly she noted a hint of cherry.  I only rated this at about a 3.9, though my wife would likely have given it another 4-4.1 at least.  

I should have rated the gold foil but I was too far gone.  Maybe some day.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Truly, Ive never had anything that either tastes or SMELLS like this that I can recall.  Awesome.  The color was phenomenal...dark, almost black in the glass, with this glowing cherry red appearing through the back when the light hits it.  Like something from a dream, it was surreal to behold.

So many things Im picking up on here. ..sour cherries, tobacco, flowers, powder, chocolate. Once it warms up the alcohol emerges - perhaps a tad too much because it masks all the other wonderful aromas. I can feel the warmth in my cheeks from the alcohol. The texture is really nice with a tannic quality to the finish. There is really no sweetness here but the sourness is subtle enough to trick you into thinking there might be. Really very different than anything I have had before. Very, very nice.","Florida, USA","BeanDip"
1143,"2005-04-03",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 10, 2007 Sept 2007. Bottle @ Rudolfs Sourfest. Small bottle, Lost Abbey version. Brown headless body.

<P>April 2007 New yellow C style bottle, courtesy of HogTownHarry. Hazy brown body with a small tan head that fades fast. Woody aroma carries over to the flavour.

More aggressive flavour than MoaB, but lacks the subtlety I liked in that one. 7/3/7+/3/16 - 3.7
<P>Radekfest 05 Old style bottle. Highly anticipated, my first Pizza Port. Headless ruby tinged mahogany body evokes the image of wine rather than beer. Samples became increasingly cloudy as they progressed to the dregs of the bottle.  Green leafy vegetation lurks deep in the shadows  accenting dry sour cherries . A complexity deserving of a meditation more advanced in both scale and duration. Moderate sourness throughout carries less disgruntled enmity than more intensely sour beers of the style.

1143,"2005-03-11",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2005 As the beer descends into my vessel it appears a deep mahogany bordering on russet in color.  Rich caramel and chocolate aromas waft upward while the other elements of plums, raisins, grapes and cherries seem delightfully restrained and well masked by the aromatic brettanomyces contribution, oak and leather aromas.  The front palate is initially malt accented providing hints of chocolate and roast, which then leads into the mid-palate, where the brettanomyces begins to take over giving a subtle and funky tartness along with notes of cherries and green grapes.  The finish is unusually lingering where the chocolate, fruit and oak flavors create a simplistic bliss.  Extremely complex flavor.  But the most amazing thing about this beer is its feel on the palate.  Knowing that it is basically fermented with 100% brettanomyces, I expected it to be fairly light in body, yet it is by far the most coating and texturized brettanomyces infused beers that has ever touch my lips.  A true sensory receptor overload with a numbing effect.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

Elegant, tart aroma of sweet and sour cherries, oak barrels, blended red wine, substantial brett notes, light caramel, light smoke and a bit of light cheese.  The body is pretty good, but could use a bit more heft.  Otherwise, its creamy and smooth.  The flavors are just great.  Tart and tangy in the beginning with the cherries and brett working hard.  In the middle, the underlying base of subtle caramel and toasted grains peak around the corner, just so you know theyre there.  The oak gives an elegant, vinous smoothness before the tang somes back at the finish.  The alcohol isnt a factor considering the rather high level, but the underlying warmth extends from the mouth throughout the body and out through the ethers.  The finish is long, lasting and dry.

1143,"2005-02-03",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2014 2003 Silver Foil  Sampled Feb 05. Thanks to who else, Eyedrinkale.Fantastic pour and aroma, all that you would expect from a top notch Flemish sour.  Bright, yet deep, cherry-mahogany brown, hazy and thick, with highlights running the spectrum from light yellow to deep burgundy-brown.  Small light beige colored head and an aroma that is near perfect in my books. Fresh squeezed tart cherry juice mixes perfectly and stunningly with ample funky Brett notes.  Sour oak hides in the background with a touch of candi sugar-like residual sweetness.  Powerful and unrelenting, I can smell this small sample as strong as ever from the first sip to the last drop.Flavor begins with tart Brett notes, sour and fruity, with plenty of acidity nipping at the palate.  Cherries, light brown malts and a touch of earthy/wood-like notes.  My only complaints come from the finish.  Rastacouere calls it ""sticky"" but it is more than the mouthfeel that irks me.  It has a bit of a stale or overly dry, nutty, lightly astringent (though not bitter, just bland and drying) note.  My best guess would be that there was a large amount of yeast in my sample, as I do belive I got a pour from towards the end of the bottle.  Wont hold it against the beer as the rest is done spectacularly.  Perfect, light and tingly carbonation, with a soothing, oily texture.   Instantly one of my new favorites.  Its like everything that is good about beer mixed with everything good about wine.  10/5/9/4/18Black label bottle consumed on 7/3/2005.  Fine bubbles create a lasting, light-tan head, quite dense and very large.  Deep, deep mahogany colored body is well-unfiltered.  Plenty of lacing coats the glass.  Smells of oak, cherry, chocolate.  Dry, lightly sharp oak tones challenge the nostrils.  Light hints of brett in the background create a pleasing interest.  Bits of balsamic vinegar in the nose as well.  Flavor begins, up front, with a big complex burst of raspberries, cherries, chocolate liqueur and whiskey.  Sharp and highly tannic.  Mouthfeel has low, tingly carbonation with some wateriness.  Quite acidic.  Tastes like a hint of cabernet when chilled, but after it warms and breathes, the whiskey takes over in the nose and flavor, leaving a burning, acidic finish.  Some alcohol and light cocoa beans, with light earth tones.  Too much whiskey for me, though.  Ill gladly take the older vintages.  9/5/8/3/152003 Red Foil from the generous JCW  Shared with SuIIy on 2/9/06.  Pretty much pure perfection in a bottle.  Hard yet simple to describe.  Thick cherries, wonderfully balancing brett, vinegar, sweet chocolate malts, drying oak.  Perfect mouthfeel, finely bubbled, tight carbonation, strong aroma, lacing, great retention on head, no alcohol apparency.  Get where its going?  5.02013 draught at Publick House on 3/20/14Tomme said he was happiest with this vintage of any since moving to the new brewery.  Wish I could weigh in but I havent had it since they brewed it back at Pizza Port....Ha, just a mere 10 years ago....Anyways, this was still pretty fuckin phenomenal.  Alcohol, prunes, cherries, brett acids and tons of malo-lactic notes join the lovely and perfectly done barrel character.  Not sweet, of course, but with more malt structure and balance than framboise or red poppy.  Incredibly complex and delicious and well-balanced between barrel, sourness, malt and with a very tight, engaging carbonation.  Still a masterpiece, not that I expected any less.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Although its totally unique, Id compare it to an oerbier reserva. It has an appealing earthy cherries aroma that lets you know from the smell its gonna be thick. Leafy, heavy vinous, airy, bitter, sweet licorice, leather and various brett tangles. Enjoyable aroma, at the limit of 8 and 9 for me, but the taste is even more so. Extremely vinous, working wonders with a sharp cheddar as I imagine it with plenty of cinammon, I could imagine mulling this. Sharp and strong herbal character, rhubard, star anise, cloves. Never feels like 11.5%.. Maple, flowers, chocolate, meat, caramel, mud, ashes etc... Liquorous texture, very syrupy, not quite still, but definitely particularly lightly carbonated. Surprisingly never too sweet, warming and drying out. A sensory overload. I plead guilty to still expecting it to be better though as Ive been hunting that one since it had less than 10 ratings.

1143,"2005-01-20",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2008 Updated Rating: 9/3/9/4/18=4.3. First Russian River bottling (the black label one), bought at PP Solana Beach in summer of 2005.  Drank this in celebration of graduating law school.  Pours a muddy thin brown with a thin fizzy yellow-tan head.  Smells: succulent cherries enrobed in vinous alcohol is the first impression; further smells (and there were many) show cherry-skin and other fleshy, resiny fruit notes (white grapes, sour apple sawdust); vanilla oakiness is omnipresent.  Smells refined and delicate, intense and well-defined in a way that other intense smells arent--it doesnt hit you over the head with its awesomeness, which makes it more awesome.  Taste belies strong notes of vinous alcohol.  Wood and tartness are the first wave.  Finish has two layers at first: initially, an almost lactic sweetness swadled in bright cherry; then, very dry, fleshy vines and a resurgent oak quality.  Further sips are a crap shoot as to which qualities in this complex beer take the fore: sometimes a semi-sweet chocolate coating bright cherries, which makes this feel almost full-bodied; sometimes the alcohol and a dry vanilla oakiness over almost plumy portish notes; sometimes, rootsy eggplant-cum-leek-cum-anise bite at the end of harsh warming alcohol.  This is so unique and classy, you have to love it.  Still, sometimes the alcohol predominated a little for my tastes, which dropped my re-rate a little lower.  Im keeping my original score, however, since I dont know if I handled the bottle as well as I could have over the years; the scores for attributes are a blend of my original and more recent ratings.  Wonderful beer.  Im glad I saved it for a special occassion.

Original Rating: 8/5/9/5/17=4.4. GABF 2004.  One of the great spectacles at GABF were the ubiquitous debates about ""beer of the festival,"" of course including the beers youve had on the side at private tastings (the 1984 Samiclaus or whatever).  This was like the ""had to mention"" beer.  Not everyone listed it as their favorite, but if you didnt, you almost had to justify why.  It was in my top 3.  Anyway, cherries like a mo-fo all around this piece, in the nose and on the initial taste especially.  Mixed with the initial burst of acidity was an undertone of not-bitter hops (nice complexity); the fruitiness blended with a soft earthiness that didnt detract from the crispness of the mouthfeel.  Red-brown in the cup, light brown head.  Perfect balance.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

1143,"2004-12-12",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2006 Gold foil.  Vineger and smelly feet.  Awesome!    Barely any sound when I popped the cap.  No head at all.  I was kind of worried that I had a bad bottle.  Brown color with a tintof red.  Absolutely no head.  Taste is cherries, vinegar, and maybe just a bit of caramel sweetness.  Add a little bit of stinky cheese to it and it would be close to perfect.  ReRate 012405:  Just had three glasses on tap at Obriens.  The lesson from the night is to drink it more on the warm side.  I think 60 degrees is about right, and brings out the malt a lot more.  I tasted dark molasses, caramel, and smoke.  When its colder,  the vinegar dominates.  As it warms,  the sourness is better balanced with the malt sweetness.  Re rated Gold Foil  071305:  Im positive that I rerated this a couple weeks ago, but for some reason didnt save.  I dont remember the specifics now but I do remember that the sweetness that I tasted was more of a maple flavor rather than caramel.  It took me 4-6 hours to drink it.  It had an explosion of flavors that lingered on forever.  Sticky finish.  Damn, it was a good review too.  ReRate 032206 Silver Foil Late 2004:  Aroma silimilar to the gold foil but with a little more smokiness.  I keep forgetting that the 2004 foil versions dont have any carbonation.  It detracts from the overall experience at first, but becomes a none issue shortly after that.  Compared to the gold foil, taste of this is a little more smokey and less sour.  I like the gold better, but this is not too far behind.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

1143,"2004-08-29",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2005 1/7/05.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, sampled courtesy of Dr. Bill in Orange, CA 1/7/05.  2003 Vintage, gold foil.  RERATE.  Ok, this one has that same dark brown body, but it actually has a decent head sitting atop the decadent beer, and it even lingers around quite awhile.  Seems it takes awhile for the bottle conditioning to do its thang, or more likely that the bottle-coniditioned versions of this beer will vary quite a bit from one to the next.  This one was lovely.  A wonderful funky flavor with great subtlety.  Super tart with awesome balance.   Chocolatey funk with long and incredibly unique finish.  Quite similar to the red foil version I rated before in terms of the flavor components (and I should say that the ""chocolate"" character is one component I love in this beer that is NOT always found in it).  But everything is much more elegantly integrated and balanced.  Where the red seemed like its sourness was overwhelming at times, this was probably AT LEAST as sour and tart, but it was simply wonderful this time around.  The carbonation, completing the luscious mouthfeel, really does wonders for this beer (which is probably a reason that I still pine for my best experience of the beer, when I had it on draft at GABF 04 and it was simply divine [Id have rated it somewhere in the 4.7-4.9 neighborhood then]).  If this is a sign of how well this beer will age (and I think it is, but it can definitely still go), Im looking forward to trying it again after years 5 and 10.  Very damn good.  9/4/9/5/18 - 4.5

8/28/04.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, sampled at Dr. Bill and Steinys 8th Annual 12-Hour Beer Festival in Orange, CA 8/28/04.  2003 Vintage, red foil.  Pours a dark brown-red with no head at all.  Looks pretty thick.  Perfectly representative of the kinds of flavors youll get when you drink it, with a dark caramelly brown, dark cherry burgundy, and sort of a rich chocolatey velvet thickness.  Nose is big dark cherry and huge oak.  The wood is very impressive.  Touch of tart cherry, and a little bit of bretty funk.  Huge flavor, amazingly complex but a bit too sour perhaps.  The other flavors are fighting to open up.  Hints of very dark chocolate without the sweetness but also without the dark roastiness.  Silky smooth and funky, almost nasty finish.  But in a good way.  A bit uneven at this point, and I can only hope its because this was the recommended ""long-term aging"" batch of this beer, and its just still too young.  Not as good as I remember from the several other times Ive tried the beer.  Still damn good, but overall a mild disappointment from what I remember to be a simply phenomenal beer.  9/3/9/4/17 - 4.2

Complex, but subtle, notes of prune, raisin, fig, oak, cherries, and vanilla. Rich grapefruit tartness was zesty and zingy, clinging to the upper third of the tongue. Snappy tartness.

1143,"2004-03-05",3.6,"Red foil: Bought at Pizza Port (San Clemente) during my recent trip there.  This was a pretty sour, gueuze-like brew that's reminiscent of a bottle of cuvee rene with cherries, despite its dark madeira-like color.  I can't say I'm as smitten with this beer as many others are.  There is no head whatsoever on this dark, opaque, aromatic brew.  It smells of typical lambic smells - barnyard, leather, all that crap.  I won't bore you with the same old adjectives - the taste of the red foil Cuvee is very tart cherry and is decent, but not of a mind-blowing complexity like I'd been led to believe.  The oak has imparted relatively little in the way of character to this beer.  I agree with Ecrvich - a noble effort worth of more study and refinement.  My suggestions to the brewers at Pizza Port whom I deeply respect: make it less tart, eg. sweeter.  Make it more complex - perhaps more oak aging in sherry casks or scotch casks.  I respect that Pizza Port has bravely tackled such a challenging, unfamiliar style with such gusto.  I'd just like to see a little more Duchesse de Bourgogne complexity of both sweet and tart.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

Nice, but didn't quite live up to expectations. Aroma is suitably complex, but the basic components are vague and a bit sherry-heavy.

Small ring of dense tan head that lasts throughout. Light glass lacing. Killer aroma, medium tart cherry, oak, light vanilla and vinous red grapes. A definite brett character that is evident in the vinegar and light leather notes. The flavor, like the aroma, is a wonder. An initial explosion of vinegar is quickly cut by a vinous big red cabernet grape tartness, which in turn morphs into some very vinous sweetness. The flavors are truly outstanding. Alcohol comes into play late but provides a very pleasant warming and serves to nicely complement the dry wine like palate.

Leaves an interesting but excellent chocolately, roasted aftertaste.  Nice silky wine-like body. Overall a very good beer.","California, USA","unclebleen"
1143,"2003-10-30",4.3,"(gabf'03) Gold winner of the strong specialty ale.  And for a good reason - this begian ale has gone to the school of rock.  Rich fruit flavors of plum, dates and cherries accompanied by a perfect blend of spices.  Complex palate is made of sipping.  Pizza Port throws down the goods.","San Francisco, California, USA","MrDick"
1143,"2003-10-01",4.0,"I was expecting maybe too much from this beer.  The brewers I know were all talking about it so I knew it was going to be good.  Could probably use a few more years of aging to bring out some wonderful belgian charecteristics.","USA","bigbeersrule"
1143,"2003-06-21",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2003 This was a standout amongst a whole bunch of crazy beers at the PP belgian fest. Such a fat brew, it tries a little too hard to impress, chocolate, caramel, amaretto, chocolate crackles (copha and cocoa) with a tight, sweet, acidic chocolate finish. Super intense beer but it just lacks integration.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
1143,"2003-04-02",4.4,"At the Barrel Aged Fest in Chicago.  A very unique and tasty beer.  Although I am not a fan of belgian sours, this beer had nice balance between the tartness and the sweetness of the cherries.  Beer pours a nice brownish/red with a small head.  Overall a nice offering.","Palos Heights, Illinois, USA","EddieG"
1143,"2003-03-23",3.1,"Heavy bodied beer. Only got a quick taste but taste like pure soy sauce. Slight cherry flavor.","Portland, Oregon, USA","BeaverBrown"
1143,"2003-03-10",4.7,"On tap at the 2003 Pizza Port 12 Hour Belgian Beer Party: Dark brown with a full head. Nice brett aroma. Some sour cherries but not overwhelming. Some dark malts. Very oakey. Nice blend of lactic sourness and brett. Some vanilla. Malty. Creamy. This beer has so much going on! Funky!","San Francisco, California, USA","mwsf"
1143,"2003-03-10",4.0,"On draught. A brownish color with a nice head. Aromas of wood (oak) and alcohol. A nice bitter flavor with Brets and fruit. I needed some more alone time with this brew.","Portland, Oregon, USA","microdyke"
1143,"2003-03-09",3.8,"Big sour cherry aroma coming from this murky brown brew. Lots of oak and hints of leather. Fairly high acidity in the finish. An excellent brew.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
1143,"2003-03-09",4.2,"Had on draught at The 12 Hour Belgian Beer Party at Pizza Port Carlsbad on March 8, 2003#34 on the program and #100 for me!!!The beer has a very pleasing aroma - a slight wine smell laced with cherries.  It's a bit tart, but wow, it's extremely flavorful.  The beer has a beautiful appearance with no head and a clear, dark red hue.  The beer is sweet, slightly acidic with a very complex, flavorful density.  I had actually left the Beer Fest for dinner, but upon reviewing my program, saw I missed this highly recommended beer.  I went back, bought another ticket and enjoyed this very fine beer.  An absolutely wonderful beer.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"
1143,"2003-03-09",3.7,"Dark brown pour, it looked like a porter. A nice aroma of sour cherry hits you. As it aired, lots of notes of brandy & complex flavors came out.  A beautiful sipping beer.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
1143,"2003-03-09",4.5,"Dark brown color. Small head. Aroma is chocolate, fruits and malts. A very complex beer. There are definite and separate flavors of; sour cherries, chocolate, raisins, rum and bananas. Nicely mixed and well balanced. Touch of alcohol bite at 12%. Very smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice, complex beer, hides the alcohol well.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1143,"2003-03-09",4.2,"Very dark. Smells like burnt bananas. Has a slightly burnt flavor to it, along with a very present sour apple taste. Could be the best I had off of the tap at the pizza port belgian fest.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"
1143,"2003-03-09",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2004 Draught: masterful 12% belgian Strong ale...super dark, burnt, almost opaque darkness with a nice lathering ring of suds above..malty, slightly smokey aroma with hints of overripe plums and alcohol..the flavors were sour, smokey, and bready...with a very chewy mouthfeel and the lovely sourness from the cherries is so perfectly balanced with the malts that it takes on its own dark complexities..Re-Rate bottle/gold foil:  Damn damn damn damn damn damn tasty in a flanders red type way...i've got one more bottle of the gold foil, and 1 bottle of the silver foil and you can't have either of them!...","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1143,"2003-01-25",4.5,"The colour is like old Liefmans kriek used to be: dark-red, trouble, deep.
Nose of old cherries, fresh cherrypie, ""boerejongens"" (=krieken on jenever). Aromas of old oak, fruit - but cherries only because known - some liquorice, old slivovitch.
Taste is sweet with fruit-sourish framing.
Most of the flavours are relatively quickly gone, except for the ""boerejongens"" -taste which goes on and on. 
This is a world-beater, if ever I've tasted one.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
1143,"2002-10-10",4.3,"On tap GABF 02:  Light brown color, sweet cherry aroma, syrupy palate, heavy sweetness.  This is more like a port or wine than beer, the liquid sticks to your tongue and wont let go.  Wow.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
1143,"2002-10-10",3.3,"GABF 2002: Dark red colour.  Intense raspberry aroma.  Nice complex fruity flavour, but perhaps not for me.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
1143,"2002-10-08",4.1,"A winner here.  Very smooth and rich, winey, but not too much so like the 15th anniversary.  Would buy this agin, if I could find it.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
1143,"2002-10-07",4.4,"GABF 2002: Rich and strong aroma, like brandy and sherry, very winey.  Sherry and Madeira flavors.  Strong, fruity, plummy and raisiny.  Strong, souring, alcoholic finish.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
