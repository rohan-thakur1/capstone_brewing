1258,"2016-12-06",3.9,"Clear, faint hazy, copper color with goods amount of activity. Slightly creamy light brown 2 finger head, lasting around 5-10 minutes, with good legs. Flavors of pineapples, orange, lemon, grass, brown sugar, ginger, sweet grains, nutmeg, and herbal spices. Biscuits and bread feel, quite sugary and a little syrupy, with a dash of bitter earthy hops. Smooth and slick full body with soft crispy carbonation. Slightly dry moderate to strong finish, very hoppy with not enough malt and zest, lingering toffee, red ale spices, and tropical fruits, with grassy and leafy hops. A cross between an IPA and ESB, but feels more like a hoppy Irish ale. Very tasty flavors and good freshness. Nicely balanced and well intensified. Overall very good quality craft.","Quebec, CANADA","Bierdimpfe"

In long: Nose of leafy hops with oranges notes and light notes of grapefruits.  Taste is just plain light fun.  Crusty bread, leafy hops, woody hops and citrusy hops, a tiny bit resinous, light caramel.  Pleasant somewhat complex hop profile although low on bitterness.  Very mild wooden bitterness.  This is the kind of not-so-tasty session beer that really gets the job done.  I preferred this one over their flagship IPA, I would drink gallons of this fun low-intensity beer.

1258,"2005-12-06",3.5,"The Lure:Citrusy, wooden hops team up with the cranberries to create a distinguished flower breed. Nutritious cereal grounds it all with aplomb, this must be a pleasant pint.

The Festivities:Floral hop flavors follow up into resinous bitterness. Cranberry-like fruitiness lies on adequate crystal malt bread. A quenchable body makes it all go down effortlessly.

Transcendence:Pride in the simple things is as honourable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1258,"2005-12-05",3.0,"64 oz growler shared with  MartinT, tiggmtl, Rastacouere, beerbuzzmontreal and Yowie.  Shy head atop a translucent, almost clear deep red body...flowery, indistinct nose with hints of honey and lightly roasty malt...slight nuttiness in the body, a decent full maltiness, but not terribly exciting...at the end, rather smoky and bitter...reasonably well-made but ultimately dull amber.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1258,"2005-02-23",3.0,"dark amber colour with minimal head.  Aroma was malty and slightly earthy with some citrus.  Slightly sweet malty taste, pretty regular.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","BeerPrince"
1258,"2004-12-24",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2005 Dark copper colour.  The aroma has the standard ""American amber"" mix of earthy crystal malts and floral, slightly citrusy C-hops.  Tastes pretty much like pommelo, eaten fresh in SE Asia.  A little toasty.  Rounded and balanced with a lingering, dry finish.  The most assertive of the Central City beers Ive had to date.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

1258,"2004-05-02",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 8, 2006 Hazy deep copper colour, cream off-white head.  Aroma is very leafy/grassy.  Dry-hopped and quite intriguing aroma.  Some sweet toasty malts in back of the dominant hopping.  Flavour is also quite leafy and grassy.  Nice spicy and resiny hop flavour are the first thing you notice.  As the beer warms a bit, the resiny notes fall back bringing out more spicy/woody hop flavour.  Light sweet toffee/bready malts with the faintest touch of cherry esters.  Great balance and highly drinkable.  This beer has really improved since the last time I had it.  I can see this becoming a go-to beer in Vancouver.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1258,"2004-02-08",3.0,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2011 Hazy light brown,thin beige head. Good citrus hop nose. Nice grapefruit hop flavor with the amount of balancing malt varying with each batch","Surrey, British Columbia, CANADA","Crit"
