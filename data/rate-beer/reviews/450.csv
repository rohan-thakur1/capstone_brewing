450,"2017-02-09",4.0,"Butelka z datą: 5/18/16
AROMAT: Średnio intensywny. Z początku wyczuwalne nuty prażone. Na drugim planie czekolada i kawa. W tle orzechy arachidowe oraz delikatna paloność.
SMAK: Wytrawne. Posmak gorzkiej czekolady i kawy - długi. Odczucie w ustach: pełne, aksamitne, choć delikatnie szczypie w język. Alkohol, jak to w ciemnych piwach słabo wyczuwalny, a w tym przypadku jest on bardzo dobrze ukryty.
WYGLĄD: Barwa czarna, nieprzejrzyste. Piana drobna, niska, choć utrzymuje się do samego końca. 
OGÓLNIE: Trzy wnioski. Po pierwsze: trzeba je dobrze ""ogrzać"" przed degustacją. Po drugie: trzeba dać mu szanse (tyczy się aromatu) i ocenić go po pewnym czasie, ponieważ z początku piwo (tak było w moim przypadku) nie pachniało tak dobrze, jak sugerował by jego status na ratebeer.

 This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Great flavour, especially for its abv, that does everything right.

450,"2015-09-05",4.0,"Roppant szerethető ital képe tárul elénk már a kitöltést követően, a Bells Kalamazoo stoutjának küllemét illetően egy szavunk sem lehet. Koromfekete, bézs színű habbal a tetején, krémes aromák tömkelege, már ránézésre is krémesnek ható test. Illatában a szokásos pörkölt hangulatok mind megtalálhatóak, pirított magvas, diós, mákos, nápolyis jegyek tolódnak össze hirtelen, majd pár pillanat múlva megnyugszik a levegő és sima, étcsokoládés-kávés karakterben egyesül a sziporkázó sokaság. Selymes teste a lehető legkönnyebben csúszik, s bár minden megvan benne, ami egy italt karakteres stouttá tesz, talán még a markánsabb ízektől idegenkedő, sötétebb hangulatú söröktől távolságot tartó közönség számára is szimpatikusnak hat a mesteri kifinomultság, ahogyan a faháncsos, hamus, zordabbnak tűnő mondandó efféle bájos módon kerül tálalásra. A tejszerű, krémes textúra, a gömbölyded és könnyednek ható szerkezet ideális környezetet biztosít a mélyebb tartalom kiteljesedéséhez, így lényegében észrevétlen módon esünk áldozatává a határtalan komplexitásnak, s a kiegyensúlyozottság példaértékű megnyilvánulásának. Valóban utánozhatatlanul sima a karaktere, az egyes kortyok során végig az étcsokoládés, elegánsan pörkölt hangulatok dominálnak, a rendre felbukkanó savanykás beütés ez esetben távol marad. S bár stoutok esetében szinte kivétel nélkül az ""imperial"" vonásokkal felruházott változatok mellett teszem le a voksom, amennyiben izgalommal teli darabok után kutatok, a Kalamazoo egyszerűségének nagyszerűsége legalább akkora élményt nyújt, mint az előbb említett típusok vadságának magával ragadó jellege.","HUNGARY","adster"
450,"2015-08-30",4.1,"Classic American dry stout from a brewery perhaps most renowned for its stouts, with dense, moussy, irregular, yellowish beige head and opaque black colour, only revealing its true deep mahogany hue in the end. Very roasted aroma giving off impressions of espresso and coffee grounds, salmiac, charcoal, iron but in a natural, blood kind of way, burnt wood, toasted bread, bitter chocolate, roasted meat, caramel candy, fried plantain, brambleberries, roasted peanuts. Refinedly sweetish onset of candied cherries and raisins countered by a deep, soft sourishness, very creamy and oily body with appropriately soft carbonation, slick caramelly and toasted maltiness evolving into a big, distinctly coffeeish roasted bitterness lining the mouth cavity, much more coffee-like than dark chocolate-like in this case, with the basic sourishness continuing and a meaty umami flavour adding complexity; peppery hops add further drought in the finish, along with a glow of warming alcohol, which in all stays well hidden (as it ought to be in a 6% ABV beer). Charming, heart-warming, exceptionally well-made, rounded, elegant and deeply roasted: this is a stout of technical perfection and great finesse. Righteously famous.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

450,"2015-03-27",4.1,"July 31st, 2013 - The Kalamazoo Stout had long been a myth in California. Spotted here in there between trees, flitting between hands and persons, but never easy to catch, grasp or drink. But Bells distribution line sagged out to include our corner of the country, bringing with it all the delicious Bells Brewery drinks, and for myself, this particular treasure. My friend and I held this beer in high enough esteem that it was included alongside aged Winter Warlocks and New Belgium Folies. The stout pours thick and oily, as expected, and effuses a lovely coffee aroma, mostly roasted, but not sweet like a mocha. Its more bitter, leading with espresso and a dryer, more continental flavor. The flavor is what really hooked itself into my memory though. I first notice a supremely foamy palate, which quickly and efficiently drapes the taste of finely roasted beans across the tongue. Lots of intensely dark chocolate here, like the essence of cacao nibs, and a deep dive of an aftertaste bringing velvety, luxurious dark chocolate. And I note here: ""Gawwdamn!"" The only drawback seems to be that this stout seems a little mild compared to the 2007 Winter Warlock, but thats comparing an old churlish boxer with a fresh faced pugilist. Different styles, same sport, and each should be appreciated in their respective corners. Each is a champion, and the Kalamazoo comes that way out of the bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance Poured a deep brown nearly black color with a two finger thick and creamy tan colored head. The head slowly fades leaving a fantastic level of lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of cocoa mixed with a burnt brown sugar sweetness. Other aromas of roasted malt and coffee combined with these aromas well creating an overall rather dark and sweet roasty aroma.

 Taste  The flavors start out with sweeter chocolate and some vanilla and brown sugar. The flavor dries some more toward the middle as flavors of coffee and a light licorice come to the tongue. The flavors take the taste to its end where they are joined by a light earthy hop taste. When all combined the flavors leave a nice cocoa and roasted semi sweet flavor on the tongue with just the right amount of bitter from the coffee and the hop to balance it all out.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker side in terms of creaminess with a carbonation level that is medium. The thicker body is nice for the darker flavors of the brew while the moderate carbonation suits the abv. and the more bitter flavors well, keeping the brew very drinkable.

 Overall  A tasty stout with a great drinkability and wonderful feel/flavor. A great roasty, but rather balanced stout.","","Darkmagus82"

A - Pours pitch black with a dense one and a half finger tall tan head, slowly dissipating down to a thin film, leaving thick sheets of lace on the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of coffee grounds, chocolate malt, toffee, vanilla and some smokey malt.

O: A smooth easy drinking stout that has sweetness and lots of earthy bitter notes to round out the taste. I was worried at first because Im not a fan of licorice forward beers but it works well with this beer and compliments nicely. A great stout to stock up on.

This is a black and opaque beer with only the tiniest dark brown at the very edges. The head is a thick tan color, and starts ample (about 2 fingers) but quickly settles to a top coat and ring. It leaves moderate lacing on the glass.

Appearance: The body is pitch black, even through the edges, with a short brown head that sticks around for a moment before settling into a sparse coating with a dense ring.
Aroma: Sweet caramel is prominent, slight burnt edge to it, sweet cocoa is behind it with a mild smokey presence. The aroma is sweet with the caramel and cocoa being the most prominent. I wish the aroma were a bit stronger though.
Taste: The intro is mild, with bittersweet chocolate creeping in. The flavor is rather mild until the finish which is a touch astringent. The finish hints at burnt malts with a touch of caramel. This is balanced between the specialty malts, but nothing jumps out. The finish is semi-sweet.
Palate: Medium bodied, Id like a little more body, with moderate carbonation.
Overall: I enjoy Kalamazoo Stout, but I do not understand why this is rated so highly. Nothing jumps out at me flavor wise, and while this is balanced nicely, I dont love it.

450,"2013-09-09",3.6,"Bottle dated 12/10/12. Poured into a shaker pint. Consumed at about cellar temperature.

Appearance: Pours with about a finger of a brown head that doesnt last long. Very dark with a bit of ruby on the edges. Your typical stout, really.

Smell: A bit sweeter than the taste, and even some dark fruits. Plenty of chocolate and coffee, and any other sort of word thats used to describe most stouts -- its here in Kalamazoo Stout.

Taste/feel: Throw out the dark fruits and some of the sweetness, the taste is much more of roasty malts, with traces of coffee and chocolate as well. A stout thats not powerfully flavorful, so its really quite easy drinking. The feel is about middle of the road -- its pretty lightly carbonated, and the beers not thick or thin.

Kalamazoo Stout is a solid Bells beer. Im not a big fan of stouts, but this ones fine and good. Its not super big, roasty, and thick like some other stouts out there (or Imperial Stouts, of course), but thats not a bad thing. Not extremely memorable, but still a good one. Definitely overrated, though, in my opinion.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

450,"2013-04-02",4.0,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. The bottle was dated 11/26/12 making it just over four months old.

Appearance: Dark black color, completely opaque. Forms a huge, brown, frothy head which is slow to dissolve and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Mild nose of milk chocolate and black licorice. 

Taste: Im so used to reviewing flavored and/or imperial stouts I forget how good a ""regular"" or stout can be. Bells Kalamazoo Stout is definitely one of the better examples of such a brew: plenty of flavor and a perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. Theres a slight licorice taste to make it a tad unique, which is all the more appreciable. 

Theres a smooth sweetness at the start. Mild milk chocolate, roasted malt and some dairy flavors are all prominent at first. Theres a strong surge of bitterness at the apex of the swig. Dry, slightly salty, coffee and nutty-like flavors and bitterness appear, though they themselves quickly recede as a lightly sweet taste of black licorice and the faintest hint of sour red grape appear on the finish. This is a delectable tasting brew for sure, but not so robust or amazing as to be among the upper echelon beers.

Drinkability: What really makes Bells Kalamazoo Stout a cut above the rest is its drinkability. Theres a lot of flavor here, but the actually deliver is remarkably drinker-friendly. The mouthfeel is smooth and soft and goes down easily. Though theres a slightly bitter aftertaste its nowhere near cloying and is actually rather pleasant. At 6% ABV its tempting to drink in large quantities since it doesnt feel like a heavy beer at all.

450,"2013-02-18",4.7,"Pours thick and dark with a dark brown head that lasts and lasts. Looks like a thing of beauty! Leaves some thick lacing. Before tasting I'm already so happy. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malts. Pretty much void of hops. The flavor follows suit. The brew is delicious with chocolate roasted malt flavors and just a hint of floral hop notes. Overall this is worth having a few times. And then again.

450,"2012-11-16",3.8,"I really liked pouring this one. I wasnt paying attention and it hurled itself out of the bottle and quickly filled the glass with inky blackness, then suddenly there was foam everywhere. The head has a weird delay when you pour it. At first, reasonable - then your glass has disappeared under creamy suds along with your coaster beneath.

This is one of those stouts that hides nothing. Everything you smell, youre going to taste, and all of it is good. Lots of roasted coffee and charred wood, without the bitterness Id expected. Some cocoa. Finishes well but isnt super complex - went awesome with the roast beef sandwich I had. Feels thinner than most other stouts.

450,"2012-11-04",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2012 Bells Kalamazoo Stout - Darkest beer I have ever seen.  Tiny head, but lacing is terrific.  Smells of licorice, coffee roast, dark chocolate, and booze - definitely grabs your attention!  Taste - hoo boy.  Definitely notice the roasted coffee notes right off the bat.  Quite bitter and potent.  Impressive, but also kind of overwhelming - have to sip it quite slowly.  More acid than Id like as well.  I would not say its syrupy per se, but it is so in-your-face that its hard to believe its not an impy.  I can see why a lot of folks might love this, but it doesnt compare to my very favorite stouts.  I actually think I prefer their Java - theres just...slightly too much going on in this one.  NOVEMBER 6 RE-RATE: Compared next to Java.  This admittedly had the appearance advantage - heads were about even, but Kalamazoo lasted slightly longer than I expected, and its lacing was better (not that Javas was bad).  Aroma - slight advantage to Java, though not reflected in the score.  Kalamazoo is arguably more complex - licorice, roast, and chocolate - but I am biased toward coffee aromas, so Java wins there.  Taste and palate - definitely prefer Java.  I can hardly believe Java has the higher ABV - I taste more booze in Kalamazoo.  Also, Java is less heavy-bodied while being just as flavorful.  Kalamazoo seems to favor the chocolate-preferring crowd.  I like my stouts more coffee-ish and less heavy-bodied, so again, I have to say I prefer Java here.  Kalamazoo is still a fine stout, dont get me wrong, but I am just more of a coffee gal.","Missouri, USA","kdm1984"

S: Very strong roast, espresso, and chocolate notes, with the licorice appearing as a secondary characteristic to the main scent. Amazingly in your face aroma.

T: The flavors are quite good, if not on the same level as the smell. Theres an opening of wood and vanilla, followed by a sudden, welcome upsurge of roasted malt and chocolate. Finally, theres a combination of a vegetal component and some subtle licorice on the finish. The flavors progress smoothly and create a good balance, being neither overly sweet nor bitter, and tastes bigger than its 6% might suggest.

450,"2012-03-12",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/228/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Batch 9984.

With a quick pour, my glass fills with a dark brown ebony liquid with a viscous look and a creamy tan head. Eventually it fades to a collar and leaves just a bit of lace. 

Roasted malt, a bit of smoke, roast coffee, and a bit of unsweetened dark chocolate dominate the nose.

The taste has a little sweetness sneak through along with the mostly unsweetened dark chocolate and roasted malt. The malt has some light burnt character to it, and there is some milk creaminess to it. The finish has a bit of licorice and a bitter coffee flavor.

The creaminess to the mouthfeel is nice. Too often stouts on the lighter part of the ABV spectrum just seem watery to me, but this has some character to it. The carbonation has a mostly creamy nature, but there are a few stray bubbles that are noticeably fizzy. The body is medium to full, and there is a soft stickiness to go along with the chocolate in the flavor.

This is definitely one of the more enjoyable stouts I have had in this ABV range. I would definitely have a few of these while I sat at a pub.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

4.5 T: Taste is much like the nose. Plenty of coffee, chocolate, vanilla creme, and licorice, which is a bit stronger in the taste. The roastiness if more aggressive, but still in a good range. Really tasty.

The licorice reveals itself massively in the flavor. Along with the massive licorice prescence there is some coffee and sweetness. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I expected or what have wanted, so it is docked a little bit.

450,"2011-02-13",4.2,"This stout carries on the tradition of what stouts were supposed to be - the fullest-bodied, strongest version of a porter.  If Bells Porter is too sweet for you, or if you dont like the stickiness of chocolaty flavor of it, try this stout.

Firs off, this beer pours an impressive hear even at fridge temperature.  This heal ends up being non-uniform and can last for over 15 minutes with just one bottle, normal pour.  The beer, of course, is the blackest brown and in a glass mug, you could confuse it for the darkest-brewed coffee.  Kalamazoo stout is advertised on the bottle as having brewers licorice, and you can smell and taste the bite in the beer.

The beers taste is just as youd expect, thick, creamy and delicious.  The taste or roasted barley is unmistakable and pairs with the licorice flavor perfectly.

If youre drinking this with a meal, youd better have some good food planned to keep up - Id recommend steak.  This beer is a little bit more bitter than Bells porter.  Have this with a nice steak and potato plate, and have a porter with/for dessert.","USA","geeklimit"

450,"2011-01-22",3.7,"I poured a 12 oz bottle into a snifter, where it sat inky black beneath a thin khaki cap that quickly became a ring and left a little lacing. This is pretty much the definition of an up-the-middle line drive of a stout: solid contact, outstanding execution, but not as exciting as a swing from the heels. You get tons of roast and a hint of caramel sweetness (especially as it warms) in the nose, and then even more roast in the flavor.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a very dark brown that was nearly opaque black in the glass with a large, tan to light brown head that kept a nice sheet. The aroma had moderate to heavy roasted malt, caramel and coffee; maple syrup, licorice and a hint of cola. The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet, light to moderately bitter and slightly sour; while the finish was sweet, rather bitter and slightly sour with a long duration. There was chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, maple syrup, bitter chocolate, coffee, slight licorice, burnt malt, cream, molasses, chocolate syrup and more underlying licorice. The medium to full body was silky and then a little dry with somewhat soft, yet slightly tingly carbonation and a slightly astringent, dry and ever so slightly chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

450,"2010-11-19",4.5,"Black as night with a bulbous cream colored head that hung around for ages.  Looks like the top of a chocolate milk shake.  Left a generous amount of lacing.  I cant wait to try this!!!  Only the most minute red hue at the bottom of the glass.  Almost Perfect.  Roasted malt in the nose that had coffee mixed with a sweet milk chocolate that was most enchanting.  Both aromas were very robust and inviting.  Both were balanced exactly and made for easy detection.  Didnt get the licorice as mentioned on the label, but that was fine by me.  The taste revealed burnt coffee and toastiness.  Bittersweet chocolate along with what I found to be a hint of caramel in the taste.  Again, balanced exceptionally well.  Didnt have the overall cream flavor that Oatmeal Stouts have, but thats OK.  Just different styles.  Leaves me wanting another sip quickly.  Medium/Full mouthfeel with decisive dryness.  Smooth with lots left on the palate after each sip.  As mentioned, not quite as creamy as some others, but still head and shoulders above average.  This beer could get me in trouble.

Finish:  lingering, smoothly bitter and extremely dry; this is where I got a hint of bittersweet dark chocolate.  Notes:  Palate is very creamy, drinkable and smooth.

450,"2010-07-13",4.0,"Batch 8432. Packaged on April 11, 2008.

Pours a thick brown/tan head. This beer is pretty much as black as the night sky (but really just a extremely dark brown). I was in awe when I first saw this beer come out of the bottle. The head stayed up almost the entire time, while the lacing was dominate. Thats right dominate.

The smell is of roasted/chocolate malts, while the beer is amazingly balance between the hops and the malts. The presence of both were well represented. I could again taste the same roasted/chocolate malts and the hop flavor was grassy.

This is such an amazing beer and I would recommend this to anybody! I am so impressed with Bells on this one!

This beer is pitch black in the glass with a dense tan head that could support small coins. Smells sweet and chocolatey with light hints of mocha. Very nice.

There is much more coffee in the flavor than in the nose. More bitter than I was expecting but with a sweetness that offsets it. The bitter and the sweet lead to flavors reminiscient of dark chocolate.

A nice thick body that is just heavenly in the mouth. Drinks smooth as silk with some light smokiness in the aftertaste acconpanied by hints of coffee and a creamy sweetness.

There is a bitter bite from the roasted grains, but it met with a slightly sweet creamyness.  The crystal and roasted malts meet each other half way, making a fairly smooth beer.

450,"2009-05-21",3.5,"This is a batch 8606 bottle.
Appearance  Pours a dark brown, almost black with light brown edges when held up to the light. A nice dense mocha colored head forms about 1 finger in size. The head retention is wonderful, sticks around for a while. After a little while it subsides to a thin layering of large bubbles.

Smell  This smells slightly astringent. Lots of hops, burnt chocolate, coffee, and the tiniest bit of figs. 

Taste  This has a chalky bitter bakers chocolate feel and taste to it. Like a mocha made with 72% cacao chocolate. Bits of coffee and hops.

Mouthfeel  Like in the taste, this feels chalky. Also it feels a lot thicker than I expected, but not too thick. The higher carbonation makes it a prickly stout.

450,"2009-03-28",4.1,"Appearance: As is typical with stouts, Bells Kalamazoo stout pours the color of black coffee. It doesnt have much of a head from the initial pour, but the lacing is rather impressive.  A good swift swirl of the glass will help pull out about a finger of stunning light brown frothy head that (again) disappears quickly.  (4)

Smell: This beer smells very good.  Ive poured this one a bit cold, but right out of the glass I get an explosion of roasted espresso.  This is followed quickly by caramel and bittersweet chocolate aromas.  There is also a nice bit of rich tobacco and floral components that gives this beer quite a bit of depth.    

Taste: Kalamazoo tastes identical to the way it smells, which is a very good thing.  There is lots of soft bitterness right away that helps carry the strong espresso and chocolate components down your throat.  The tobacco from the nose comes across on the tongue, too, which is a very nice touch.  For a 6% ABV beer, this thing is packed to the teeth with deep, dark roasty flavors.  

Mouthfeel: Although there is a ton of roasted flavors in the mouth, the beer feels a lot lighter than youd expect.  The bitterness is only faintly detected by the palate, and there is not a lot of heaviness that coats the mouth.  I would even say this is one of the lighter stouts Ive had; which is good considering how drinkable this is.

Overall: Bells Brewery continues to amaze me.  Ive yet to drink one of their beers that isnt extremely inspired and worthy of my hard earned cash.  The Kalamazoo stout, along with the heavier Expedition stout, is a very solid stout.  Where the Expedition stout is meant to be more of a sipper, the Kalamazoo is something that can be enjoyed at a bit quicker pace.  With such a low ABV, this is one that can be ready to go with only about 30 minutes in the fridge.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","amneziak"
450,"2009-03-25",3.9,"12 oz bottle courtesy of the Binnys Singles Rack (Orland Park, IL). A beer Ive been meaning to get at for awhile now.

Aromas are a nice combination of roasted malts, vanilla, creamy chocolate, caramel, light coffee. Initial is a good follow through, medium bodied, nothing overbearing, bringing on some good roasted flavors, bitter chocolate and coffee. Finish brings in some more of that creamy vanilla and caramel, but largely the sweet stays away. Instead depending on roast and bitterness. The beer is smooth and creamy in body, yes.. but stays true to roast. Nothing overbearing or burnt though. Great stout, through and through.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Nice chocolate head, but not that viscous pour I was hoping for. Nice coffe and chocolate aroma, and it becomes even more pungent as the beer warms. Not extremely pungent, but good enough. Nice sweet coffe and chocolate taste with a slight bittering finish. Nice roast touch that is awesome as well.

Thick smell of coffee with hints of anise, along with a thick creamy texture and rich roasted coffee flavor make this stout a beer that eats like a meal.

Wow, does this smell great - big roasted malt backbone with hints of coffee and dark, sweet chocolate.  It all melds together so well as a single wonderful aroma.

The taste didn’t quite live up to the aroma, with the sweet chocolate and dark roasted malts still dominating.  The main reason it falls slightly short is the bitterness of the coffee which is a little overpowering in the finish.

The mouthfeel is as good as I have ever experienced for a stout of this style.  It’s so decadent and smooth with a perfect amount of carbonation that accentuates the taste.  Beautiful feel on the palate.

Those crazy physicists at CERN might want to take another look at to what happens to light once it is sucked thoroughly through a black hole.

The stout itself is excellent. Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a small bit of foam which settles out fairly quickly. It goes down smooth, not heavy at all, leaving a slight brussels lace trail on my Guinness glass (sorry Guinness) between sips. I can definitely taste hints of coffee and dark chocolate, along with licorice. Very faint, but it is there indeed. I am not a licorice fan, in fact, I rather dun like it, which is why I was hesitant for so long to try the Bells Kalamazoo Stout which is made with licorice. I should know better by now - all good beers deserve a fair try. The first sips right out of the fridge where cool, which slightly masked the spectrum of flavor, but as the stout warmed a bit, more of the licorice and dark chocolate come into play. I definitely recommend giving the Kalamazoo Stout a few minutes to warm before having a quaff.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

450,"2008-07-09",3.7,"When I saw this poured out, I had to say ’wow’!  Very dark, thick reddish brown head, soapy notes in aroma along with chocolate.  Palate is neither sweet or dry, I guess that’s why they call it a stout, weird to me, used to sweet or dry.   It’s nutty, with some coffee notes and a bit of hops, but overall pretty mild.  Well the longer your drink it the less mild it seems.  Creamy feel.  Drank this fairly warm.  Just had it in the fridge about 1/2 hour.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"
450,"2008-07-07",4.3,"Much like their Expedition stout, this is too is a top notch stout.  I’ve been able to have this beer several times over the past two years via generous traders and have never been disappointed.  The beer pours out a nice black hue with a creamy 1-finger thick tan head.  Aroma just screams for you to inhale.  Dark chocolate, espresso, roasted coffee beans, and scorched marshmallows pulls you in.  Dark fruits, coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, chewy malts, with a slight finish of molasses.  Could be an every day beer if Bells ever decided to distribute out this far.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

450,"2008-07-05",4.6,"Pours out black with a nice tan head with very good retention. Smell is very complex, reminds me of Dark Lord, full of coffee, chocolate, and different dark fruits, very very good. Taste is awesome as well. Starts out deceiving, but then all of a sudden it hits you with an onslaught of taste. Beginning is green, then roasty, changing quickly into cherries, plums, other dark fruits, then adds some chocolate and coffee flavors to finish it off. If it didn’t start off a little weak with the green flavor it would be an easy 5 for taste. Medium carbonation, medium to full bodied, slick on the tongue. If the very beginning of the taste was eliminated this would just be beyond a great beer, the green flavor isn’t bad, but doesn’t seem to fit with the rest of this beer. Seriously get this if you see it. Highly recommended.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

First Impression: A very impressive presence - a nice aroma, good head and rich flavor. Aroma is bitter, coffee, and roasty. Visuals are an inky black body topped with a tan head that is persistent and lacy. Taste is thick with espresso notes, licorice, and pepper. Palate is perhaps its downfall - a bit weak, with a medium finish. Second Impression - not anything close to a Yeti or a Shakespeare, but not a bad stout - far surpasses a Guinness. But for $4.50 a 12 oz bottle, Id much rather have the Yeti.

450,"2008-04-28",1.8,"First off, I have to complain about the label... WTF is that hideous graphic, a portrait of a charred corpse?!? Im not sqeamish, but Its shockingly offensive enough to demote the beers appearance by a point. Exiting the bottle in an oily brown stream, the stout settles in my glass with absolute opaque, brown-fringed inkyness. Gazillions of tiny, tiny bubbles muster merely a ring of dark tan foam and scattered speckles of lace. A surprisingly plain nose exhibits gentle nutty, coppery, and leafy vegetal scents. A bit raisiny as well?? The flavor evokes half-burnt fireplace logs and the daintiest hints of granola and honey... like the aroma, it is dark, rough, and dimensionless. Thick, creamy, mousselike mouthfeel is shattered by chalky, scouring velcro tannins, and ends up feeling like a  mouthful of fiberglas insulation. The finish flashes with brief, tinny tartness before settling into a permanent charcoal and salty parmesan rind aftertaste. To summarize: harsh and jagged... a beer as linear, acrid and muddy as chewing dry ground coffee beans... or the ashes from a cheap ""sweet"" cigar. In a year or two it might mellow to palatability, but will never be remotely enjoyable or complex. Im completely pissed at this f*cking waste of my money !","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"

This beer is like squid ink, black without any light penetration. A thick, fluffy, chocolate milk head leaves a heavy lacing behind.
A very mild beer on the nose. Chocolate malt and currants are most distinguishable. As I drank, I began to pickup a smoky backdrop the deeper my nose got into the glass.
The currant sweetness fades quickly to leave a long roasted coffee bean aftertaste that just sticks to the back of the throat. A tad bit too long for me.
Its a heavy, creamy, medium carbonated stout. Great balance.
This is a definite sipper that grew on me. I decided to hold off on tasting notes until I had a second later in the week. The aftertaste is a bit much, but the subtle nose and delicate palate made up ground for me. This would probably pair well with sweet desserts to help cut that bitter closing.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","FleeVT"

450,"2008-03-08",4.1,"12 oz bottle (Batch 8007)
For some reason it took me a long time to get around to cracking this open.  I regret doing so.  While it is not quite on par with Expedition this is still a world class stout that deserves all the accolades heaped upon it.  It might be interesting to take a bottle of each, age them equally and see how they change.  The results couldnt be that disappointing unless one does a poor job of cellaring.
Aroma / Appearance - The temporary head was the color of freshly fallen walnut shells.  The body could have been mistaken for Expedition, being equally dark in color.  The scent of coffee, smoke, licorice and nuttiness stand out most.  There are other active smells as well which combine to form a very dense and complex experience.
Flavor / Palate - Anise/licorice, black coffee and slightly dry plain cake form the basis of the first sip.  The experience is very consistant.  It wraps up with the same black licorice taste.  For a regular stout this is an excellent world class release.  I can definitely see myself returning to this one in the future.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The flavor consisted of cold coffee, bittersweet chocolate, a touch of burnt malt, and some mild molasses.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and creamy smooth with light carbonation.

Poured into a pint glass, quite black with a tan one-finger head. The foam leaves a bunch of thick lacing as it dwindles to a cap.

Aromas of chocolate graham cracker, sweet cream, and a hint of roastiness. Heavenly.

Flavor tones down the sweetness a bit, while upping the roasted character. Fudge at the very front of the palate, then a big roasted finish with some astringency. I would have liked more sweetness to balance out the roasted bitterness because it seems a little too harsh for a sweet stout. 

The carbonation is a little high for a stout, but it remains pretty smooth, and the roastiness makes for a dry finish.

The middle of the tongue picks up some milky sweetness in the malts, along with more coffee and chocolate. The finish is dry and extremely roasty and has a firm level of earthy hop bitterness. The aftertaste tastes like a mixture of earthy hops and espresso.

Pours about as dark as beer can get with only faint chocolate brown highlights, the head a thin but rich espresso film with spotty lacing.  Nose is massive roastiness, rich chocolate with tart yeast characters, also faintly dusty and with a surprising amount of alcohol considering its only 6%.  Licorice hits you right up front and seems almost overwhelming on first sip, but as you keep going you realize how well integrated it is into the body of the beer.  The beer is quite lively on the palate, as the licorice brings initial bitterness that is quickly melded to notes of coffee, bark, drying out to a lingering smoky aftertaste where wintergreen hop character appears.  Not a simple beer by any means, made even better by the fact that its bottle conditioned.  Very nice.","USA","ElGaucho56"

Pours an insanely deep brown (almost black?) color - totally opaque - with an unbelievably creamy tan head.  Its stunning, really.  The aroma is of coffee notes and roasted malt.  Again - stunning.  The aroma is neither overdone nor overpowering - its balanced perfectly.  And it complements the beautiful flavor that this brew provides.

Aroma is of roasted malts, coffee, and licorice. Mouthfeel is creamy and a bit on the heavy side. At first the taste is of roasted malts, but as the beer warms a coffee flavor becomes more dominant. Also, undercurrents of licorice. The only negative thing I will say about this beer is it left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This was a great brew from Bells. I cant wait to get my hands on some Expedition, hint.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"

Creamy, nice body and mouthfeel with good a carbonation level, but I get the roast & ""soy"" flavor more than coffee and chocolate.

Great coffee and raisin in the body, with the smallest hint of liquorice reminds me ever so slightly of a sambuca shot with a coffee bean chaser.

The flavor supports that theory, as it is quite sugary up front.  The taste profile is a beautiful mix of various chocolates, both sweet and bitter, as well as licorice, raisons, anise, coffee, and some bitter hops.

Nuances of roasted coffee bean, bakers cocoa, leather, grilled meat, molasses, and black cherry. Robo Hop steps in and brings the roasted malts to a new level of awareness.

Taste: Rich, roasty espresso and dark chocolate flavor smoothed out with a shot of cream. A noticeable, fruity twang and a hint of licorice keeps things interesting. The finish is strongly roasty, and slightly astringent.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation.

Drinkability: Quite nice! It should be on anyones list of things to drink before they die.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Roasted malt hits the nose immediately, lots of coffee and nuts in the aroma. Its robust and inviting. Rich dark pour with a thick fluffy light brown head that eventually fades along with some mild lacing. This beer is a meal in a glass that provides a silky smooth mouthfeel both creamy and filling. Roasted malt is the first flavor that is noticed followed by black coffee, roasted nuts, and mild chocolate. Taste is phenominal. What a great stout it drinks like a mild dry or sweet stout but is packed full of aromas and flavors more likely found in the imperial style.

Pour is about perfect for the style... dark motor oil body with a two-finger brown head.  Aroma on this particular bottle was a little less than most in recent memory, but chocolate is there as are some sweet vanilla wafer like undertones.  Flavor is about perfect... smooth chocolate maltiness, vanilla sweetness and a little bit of a fade into a coffee like bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is really smooth.  I guess part of the draw for me on Kzoo Stout is that it isnt like so many of the overdone, alcohol heavy, shock and awe stouts out there.

Pours a slick, syrupy black with a small caramel head that fades to a spotty film with some head still clinging to the edge of my snifter. The head oddly forms after the pour, which was fun to observe. The aroma is smokey with obvious licorice, chocolate and roasted malts. The mouthfeel was velvety smooth and full-bodied. The flavour did have a smokiness to it, which was surprising, but in no way inappropriate for the beer. The The caramel and black roasted malts were initially the most apperent, yet in the finish, the chocolate and licorice truly came through. There is some nice bitterness from the roasted malts and minimal hopping in the aftertaste, which lingers for quite some time.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

450,"2007-05-27",3.8,"I was fairly pleased with this stout.  It is oddly smokey, which I was not expecting, but lacked the awesome amount of dry ""burned pizza crust"" roastiness Ive come to expect from truly top-drawer stouts.  I was a bit intrigued by the remark on the bottle about the inclusion of ""brewers liquorice"" I learned about from the label.  This beer reminded me a great deal of Alaskan Brewings smoked porter; it is good and recommended.

Appearance is an inky black with a decent head that seems to materialize once the beers been in your glass for 10 seconds already.  Aroma is very chocolately, but this didnt show up much in the flavor.  The flavor was distinctly smoky, which I was a bit intrigued by.  Mouthfeel was smooth and good.

Definite plum, raisin, fig and every other dried fruit flavor in there.  A touch of cherry.  Sweet up front, transitioning into a mellow dryness in the back.  Nice earthy hop bite back there.  Perhaps the best part of the beer is the dense, smooth palate, which somehow doesnt reduce the perfect drinkability one bit.  I almost feel like I can taste a bit of alcohol, but that may be the licorice playing tricks on me.

The appearance is super dark brown with a tan three finger head. The flavor is like the aroma with an assertive bitterness despite a lack of hops in the aroma. The palate is thick and the aftertaste is dry and very much like bitter coffee. If you are a lover of true stouts then you will enjoy this beer.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"

Finish is all coffee and chocolate, with some nice malt in there. Wow, it does taste as good as it smells and looks! Chewy palate, very easy to drink. The coffee and chocolate notes hang around for quite a while. The kind of beer you cannot wait to take the next sip from. The best beer of the evening by a pretty good margin, and thats a compliment when another 99% overall beer was sampled tonight. I see several 6 packs of this in my very near future. Outstanding.

450,"2007-03-16",4.2,"My fellow Americans dont understand stout.  They seem to think its alright for stouts to have the texture of Cool-Whip and the flavor of a newsprint.  Its enough to bring one to his knees in despair.  Ive come close to climbing atop a soapbox downtown and proselytizing about the need to understand a stouts yearnings.  Looked at from a distance, you would see how the skyscrapers parallel my body framing me in concrete loneliness.
And just when I thought I couldnt go on, just when I thought that I was the only one in the entire world that cared, I found this, Kalamazoo Stout.  It made me believe in America again.  This tastes remarkably like stout.  It has body, it has flavor, it has a purpose and a sense of being.  Thank you Bells.  Thank you.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","Zymologist"

The aroma is solid with highly roasted to outright burnt malts and behind that is a hint of sweeter malts. The mouth feel is full for a stout and refreshing in the beginning and thins out in the end. The taste starts with burnt and roasted malts and carries it through to the aftertaste. There are moments when the malts seem charred but not chalky or sooty at all. The flavor is helped a lot by drinking it at roughly 65F. Really nice brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Anyway, a very solid stout. The head was explosive and mostly lasting. Lacing was very good. Color is very black. After pour, I held my glass to the light...and I saw nothing but black!

This beer has a roasted barley aroma. It smells malty sweet with hints of caramel. It has an ever so slight chocolate aroma. Some dark fruit is also present in the aroma. Mostly figs and raisins.

This beer tastes exactly like it smells. A nice robust roasted malt flavor. It has a nice sweet flavor also. Some caramel maltyness. A little bittersweet chocolate mix in also. Figs make a slight appearence in the flavor as well.

This beer goes down very smooth. It leaves a sweet and roasted malt aftertaste. Low carbonation. It is a little thinner than I would expect.

I think this beer would make a good session beer. It is mild enough to not become overbearing. Also, it is not too high in alcohol, so putting down a few is possible.

450,"2007-02-16",4.2,"From notes 12Dec2006.

Pours a very dark black, with very little hints of light creeping through the edges. The head is about one finger at the peak, and fades slowly to a soapy cap and ring. Theres a nice webbing of lace.

Smell; lots of roasted malt aromas, with chocolate, coffee and molasses. The coffee gets a bit stronger as this warms, and a bit of currants make an appearance as well. At first I wasnt sure I likes the aroma, but as the beer warms, this one just gets better.

Taste; this actually starts out a bit sweet, despite all of the roasted malt aromas. But then the slightly bitter chocolate and coffee come to balance out then sweetness with a little bit of bitterness. Once again, very nice.

Mouthfeel/Drinkability; Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and a bit on the creamy side, with a very smooth and natural feeling carbonation. With the big roasted coffee flavors, this one id very drinkable for me, as I love coffee.

I purchased this bottle while in Michigan, but I can now get this in Council Bluffs, Iowa. As with most of the Bells beers Ive had so far, this is one damn fine brew.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

450,"2007-01-25",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2007 22 oz draught at the Winking Lizard Tavern (Crosswoods) in Columbus, Ohio on 1/23/2007...  Bells Kalamazoo Stout is pitch black and has an extremely dense and creamy mocha-colored head.  The head pretty much never disappears and leaves dense lacing on the glass from top to bottom.  The aroma is mocha with a hint of roastiness.  The flavor is roasted malt, cocoa, and some mocha latte.  The finish is roasty and dry with some black coffee-like bitterness.  This stout is full-bodied with a very creamy texture.  Overall this beer is rich, flavorful, well balanced, and an all around great stout.

450,"2007-01-24",3.6,"12 oz. bottle. Aroma of mocha, roasted almonds, brown sugar, and a touch of hops. Pours a dark brunette with an amber hue and a small to moderate amount of sable head. The dominant flavor is coffee, and it is overly strong. There is also a slight lemon tartness, apparently from the hops. I do taste the licorice but probably only because the bottle told me it was there. The flavors are not particularly complex. Not as much aftertaste as I expected. Medium-bodied and lively in the palate. The beer becomes bland as it warms. I recommend drinking it relatively cold. Considering how highly rated this beer is, it stands as a disappointment. Frankly, I probably was generous in the rating. I easily could have rated this as low as a 3.3. Its not bad, but Ive certainly tasted better traditional stouts.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

The taste brings the same flavors plus some chocolate and I thought I may have caught some licorice in there.  I love the malty front followed by the coffee and bitter chocolate finish.  Just the right amount of lingering for me.  I really enjoyed the nuttiness this one had.  While some people think the mouthfeel was too watery, I think its just fine.

450,"2007-01-22",2.9,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2007 I have high hopes for this beer, Kalamazoo. First it is a stout which makes me think it will be bitter and secondly it is from bells.  They really make some interesting beers.  Dude on the front of this brown 12 oz  bottle is watching me thru his biker shades and he dont look too happy!  I am always apprehensive about rating beers that come so highly recommended. Odd, musty, non fruity, tennis shoe dish-soap aroma when you pop the top. You know, like the smell of a paper fire that was put out prematurely with water?  You would never expect the color from the aroma, very dark, possibly opaque in my steeler stein.  Slight creamy darkish tan head.  Flavor impact is that of good black coffee, roasted wood and something else malty, chocolately or something.  Fairly smooth and viscous. A bitterness hits the back of your throat but I think the complexity of the mixed flavors washes it away, for the most part. Very interesting though it is tuff to stop thinking of the harshness.  The taste is now beer that has been poured over burnt wood.  This is almost as sweet as sam adams cream stout. These stouts do have a lingering bittersweet finish that hangs on for a few moments or two. Much better than the offensive bells expedition.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

450,"2007-01-16",4.5,"Great aroma (find out for yourself). Pours a beautiful and not-too-creamy head. Just right. This stout is deep black indeed, which is, initially, misleading (I usually think ""thick, creamy, heaviness with dark dark stouts). This stout is beautiful in every way, but not overbearing and heavy. They go down surprisingly quick, not just because of the delicious combination of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate (in that order), but because the lack of a bitter/heavy finish. Instead you receive a crisp and surprisingly lingering and winning combination of dark chocolate, light spice and coffee. Just an all-around winner and one of the best stouts anyone can ever have the pleasure of tasting. Im hooked.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"

450,"2006-11-01",4.0,"Bells Kalamazoo Stout
12 oz bottle
Packaged 03/06, partaken 10/06
Medium pour in an English pint.

Poured black with a rocky mostly lasting light brown head with excellent lacing.

Smelt of moderate mild chocolate, dry nuttiness, mild coffee.

Flavor was upfront strong coffee bitterness with light sweet creamy chocolate tones, followed by a strong nutty coffee bitterness with light chocolate accents, on a long bittersweet molasses finish.  Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied, creamy and silky, with soft carbonation and slight astringency.

Overall, a very comfortable easy drinking, flowing, tasty stout, that could use some work on the aroma.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"

Palate: good. Overall, short of something great. I was excited about trying this native stout, figuring a smaller brewery tries harder. This higher-alcohol beer is in a different category than a classic Irish Stout. Its more of an Export variety. Definitely NOT a Sweet Stout, either. More complexity is needed.","USA","roccotool"

450,"2006-09-15",4.3,"This beer pours out of the bottle in a stream the reminds me of used motor oil. Once in the glass, its a glowing black with a dark and murky tan and copper head.

Smells of a great blend of dark, smoky barley, coffee and a creamy nuttiness. The dryness of the burnt elements are delightfully offset by a slight malty sweetness.

The flavor starts with a mild barley, toasted marshmallow and nut foundation that picks up dry elements with the onset of the carbonation. This releases the expected smoky elements and a touch of honey. This beer then finishes off with a smooth coffee and smoke.

The mouth feel is surprisingly glassy and smooth with a micro-bubble carbonation. 

As far as the smokier stouts go, this ones top notch. Its charred, but still smooth and clean with a superb silky mouth feel.","South Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","DTB"
450,"2006-09-06",4.1,"This beer started off pouring a huge head, which eventually died down to a normal amount of lacing.  Aroma was gentle, but had some dark chocolate and....something vaguely whipped and dairy like.  Tough to describe that quality.  The texture of this beer was excellent.  It managed to feel creamy and thick, yet light enough for easy drinking (rather than gradual sipping) if you choose to do so.  Flavors had some additional caramel and toffee notes, along with dark chocolate and milkiness upfront, and the flavors becomes more and more roasty as you swallow.  The bitterness on the throat seems to come from the roasty malts rather than a hop presence (though I assume hops are there?).  Great beer though, perfectly balanced yet easy to drink compared to some of the real big beers out there.  Its tough think of a better regular stout out there.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Bold aroma is all dark roasty malts, bitter chocolate, barely ripe figs and floral notes.

450,"2006-06-11",4.0,"Poured a dark brown almost black color with red highlights on the edges and in parts of the body in the right light. Head was one finger and creamy but subsided to a thin but steady covering. Lacing was ok, not fantastic. The aroma was of strong coffee and smoked ash. The flavor was first of coffee and the strong roasted ash flavor hit me in the first few sips. The hops come through strongly in the finish, nice resinous flavors. As this thing warmed, it got more complex and far exceeded my epectations. Light chocolate and lactic tones started to come through with nuts developing underneath. The flavor is persistent long after each sip, lingering on the tongue. The mouthfeel is moderate to full bodied, but not motor oil thick or anything like that. The more I tasted of this, it came off like a sweet milk stout more than any other type of stout. A nice offering. Re-rate, May 06: A consistent experience, a very nice stout.","","User37895"

Aroma of milk chocolate, some roast, cherry, vanilla and coffee.     Flavor of chocolate, light coffee, toffee, nuts and I was getting a light hint of metallic at the end.  This is the best ""basic"" stout I have had in a while.  Typically the Imperial Stouts tend to get my attention, but this one is right up there with the Imperials.

No way its a 99/100 percentile brew.  Vinegar, black olive and crosotic aroma that wasnt the best.  Damn near opaque Jacobean brown-black, pilin head.  Bad label.

450,"2006-05-24",4.1,"Appears a midnight, pitch black with a foamy, 1 finger tan head that slowly fades out into a collar. Scattered lacing is left around the tulip glass.
Smell is of deep, dark roasted malt, sweet cream, roasted chestnut, vanilla, and a hint of bitter coffee beans touched with bakers chocolate.
Taste is of the same aromas with a dark roasted malt that stands out above everything else and sticks to the tongue.
Mouthfeel is full bodied with a sugar sweetness and dark roastiness battling it out for supremecy with the fizzy roastiness lasting long after the swallow.
This one is pretty good. The roasted malt and slightly overcarbonated body makes it a bit uneasy to swallow easily but it doesnt take away from the great characteristics found in this brew.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Smells like a campfire roasted smore complete with graham cracker, toasted marshmellow, and light milky chocolate.  Breakfast aromas of toasted whole grain bread waft to my nostrils as well, spread with a light layer of seedless blackberry jam.  That definitely brings back fond memories of living in Michigan.  Rich, full-bodied mouthfeel brings Saturday morning construction site cofee to the palate, straight from the thermos on a cold fall morning.  Some slightly bitter dark chocolate notes follow along eagerly.  Long lasting, dry finish with a hint of anise and salted oats in the final smack.

450,"2006-01-29",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2007 impenetrable, this beer is like a black hole with a dense creamy head.  The aroma doesnt do the appearance of this beer justice, though only because it is fairly weak in scent... though what aroma there is smells creamy.  The flavor is really outstanding, the standard rich/creamy/coffee/chocolate flavor of a stout, with excellent mouth feel.  The flavors become more intense as this beer sits at room temperature for longer.  Ive drank very few superior beers.May 16, 2007:
Well, I have to mark off flavor by 2, palate by 1, and overall by 2.  This is a damnded fine beer, dont get me wrong, but this was a very early rating.  The nose was still great, I was tempted to up that.  The appearance is still phenomenal, though from the bottle I had less head.  The palate is a little bit fizzier.  The flavors are a bit more astringent and cola like that I remember.  Dont get me wrong, Id still drink this every day if my local had this on tap, but its just not the ethereal nectar of the Gods I once thought it was.

450,"2006-01-25",5.0,"Many beer geeks believe substyle of stout called ""American"" stout, should be added to the stout and porter category. So examples like Kalamazoo Stout will fit in, and can be judged against other stouts that would also fit into this new style. 

So what is American Stout? It is basically a big, robust, flavorful stout, with big malt character, but also really big hop character. And what makes it American, is most brewers are using lavish doses of PNW hop varieties such as Cascades, Chinooks, Centennials, and Columbus. Kalamazoo stout pours to an opaque, ink black color with a big, creamy tan head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is packed with aromas of malt and hops. Big whiffs of chocolate malt, and coffee pair with piney, citric aromatics. The palate is a firm malt back bone of dark malts. Flavors of dark chocolate, coffee, and a hint of vanilla coat the tongue. This beer has a very hefty body, it is quite viscous and oily, it really does resemble ""motor oil in a glass"". This beer finishes with big chocolate malt flavors up front, then dries out with a slightly roasty/coffee character, and a lingering hop bite. This beer is a bit stronger than dry or cream stouts, weighing in at about 6.5% abv, but isnt quite as potent as Imperial stout. 

What ever you want to call this beer, call it delicious, because it is. This is one of my all time favorite beers, from one of Americas best breweries. This beer is a perfect desert beer. Match this with German chocolate cake, or chocolate pudding with fresh whipped cream.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

A roasty/smoke malt medley I cannot begin to do justice to, coffee beans, dark chocolate, cream, woodiness, juniper berries, hops - mmmmmm.  Taste follows the nose, quite bitter, even more juniper and tart blackberry notes, starts with some chocolate but the coffee and tartness join up with the hop bitterness to make this a decidedly long, smooth but bitter finish.

Fragrant fruit (grape, apple) jumps out of the glass first and leads the way for some extremely aromatic dark coffee, espresso chocolate malt, faint smokiness of dark roasted malt, caramel notes with yeast (leather) on the nose.  Dark bitter coffee and chocolate, biting like your wake-me-up espresso, oh this would make a great morning brew, modetately bitter lasting flavor with some sour leathery yeast notes.

I figured it was about time to drink my last bottle of the 6 pack I bought in December 2005. Wonderful aroma very similar to what I reported in 05. Amazingly thick, oily, and soft mouthfeel. Easily a 5 on the palate. I dont notice much of a bitter finish as I reported in 05. It seems to have mellowed quite a bit. Nothing over-powers anything else. Its just an amazingly thick, soft, and roasted mouthful. One of the best beers Ive had for sure.

That infusion of flavors fades leaving a sweet and mildly bitter taste lingering on the palate for minutes.  This beer would defiantly satisfy the thirst of the Bolshevik philosopher on the label.

I didnt realize they used oatmeal in this one, but after having it again last night, Im almost certain they do. I like the fact that Bells doesnt go over the top with the roast here and opts for balance instead. Better on cask (several times at Bling Pig in Champaign, IL), but certainly fine out of the bottle as well. REVISED: Mr. Larry Bell reports no oatmeal.

Doesnt fit easily into category - ie., isnt Irish, imperial, sweet, cream, milk, etc.,etc. Only one of the best stouts around.","Franklin, Indiana, USA","jahughey"

450,"2005-09-04",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2007 Batch 6833, bottled April 14, 2005 enjoyed on October 24, 2005. Pours jet black with a thick, creamy, lucious brown head that fades to a tan hue that covers the body. Excellent lacing. Aroma is a wonderful blend of coffee, molases and chocolate.  Flavor is immediately of burnt molasses and coffee. Lots of great roastedness. This is closely followed by more bitterness from the citrusy hops. This flows into a burst of molases, toffee, caramel, raisins and plums, sweet and malty. Every drop is delightful. Taste fills the mouth. The finish is long with lingering bitterness and I savor every moment of it. Texture of this beer is incredibly smooth, creamy and chewy, coats the mouth.  Carbonation is soft and lightens the weight of this full-bodied brew. The full flavor and complexity of this masterpiece can be match by only a few imperial stouts, and yet it still quite sessionable. There is no better stout on the planet. There is not a single thing I would change in this beer, I have to give it a perfect score.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
450,"2005-09-02",4.2,"Very nice deep black pour with almost no head.  Wouldve picked up that last point with some head retention.  Sweet aroma with chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and other very nice roastiness.  Powerfully creamy and smooth across the palate, with a light chocolate bitterness on the finish.

If I hadnt JUST had the Java Stout by Bells Id probably be more wowd by this a lot more. Lots of bitter coffee and roasted flavors in the foretaste followed by a chocolate sweet creaminess.

450,"2005-08-17",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2010 bottle. Pours solid black with a dark brown head. The aroma is very roasty and ashy with assertive espresso notes. The mouthfeel is moderately dense for a regular old stout. This really brings the expedition stout to mind, just a little milder. Solid smoky, burnt, espresso notes are way up front on the palate with light creamier notes in the finish. Its pretty much expeditions little brother. Great stout.

Pint from a cask at Nicholsons Pub. This is one stout that translates well in a cask. The palate is very creamy and slick and the serving temperature really lets the strong roasty qualities shine. The finish is everlasting and savory like espresso and meat. Hops start to be noticed after a few sips. This is one tasty brew.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
450,"2005-08-03",4.5,"Black black black. Tan head. Mighty aroma here, only matched by its taste. Lots of molasses and brown sugar, combined with tons of roasted malts. This IS a stout.

The flavors are quite roasty, and suggest coffee, molasses, caramel, and a bit more chocolate. I could also detect a bit of hop flavor as well, but most of the bitterness comes from the roasted malts. Massive body to this one too!","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"

Great coating mouth feel, creamy and rich, mild/low alcohol.  Mild roasty flavor, medium finish, but still very satisfying.  Low hop profile.

Flavor is very reminiscent to Expedition stout but everything is divided by 2.  That same sweet chocolate and mocha flavor.  Not nearly as much hops.  And of course half the alcohol.  Relatively thin mouthfeel for such a dark stout.  Makes for a very tasty stout.  Tons of what looks like powdered chocolate leftover in the bottle.

Strong aroma with roasted coffee and dark chocolate coming out the most. I was able to smell this as I was pouring it. Taste is similar with a bitter coffee flavor up front and a slight earthy hoppiness as well. Slight bit of cream to the flavor before it ends in a lingering bitter coffee aftertaste.

The aroma had plenty of toasted and burn malts, some ash and sharp hints, as well as some root aromas.  The body was very interesting in that it was creamy and fluffy as well as being lite and a bit watery, very odd combination.  The flavors were big on toasted malt, and smores came to mind a few times (gram cracker, charcoal, and coco hints).

450,"2005-03-30",4.1,"Great thick pour.  Smells are wafting at me from a foot away.  Aroma is heavy laden with molasses and oats.  Also smells of burnt rubber with some cinnamon.  This rating is somewhat of a tale of two temperatures.  The first 4 oz. or so, I had the beer at about 35 degrees.  It wasnt anything special at that temp, so I let it warm to about 50 degrees, and the difference was night and day Hence, I continue  Great, full body.  Caramel coffee edge, semi-sweet chocolate and toffee.  Hints at black licorice.  Theres a discernable dry bitterness left on the back 1/3 of the tongue.  Its slippery but dense, and prolongingly diffuses, making its presence known by peeling slowly off the palate.  Solid stout.

I loved the opaqueness of pure black and the chunky brown head, but other than the appearance, it fell short of what a Bells stout should be.  It lacked boldness of body and complexity of flavors.  It had a slight malty roastiness, but that was about it.  Maybe it was old and stale.  Certainly not a 99.","Kettering, Ohio, USA","Maddog"

Chocolate, coffee, and loads of roast malt in the aroma.
This starts out with a bitterness that lasts right through to the end. The Chocolate, coffee and a bit of sweetness make an appearance, but this one is dominated by the roast malt bitterness. I prefer a Porter over a Stout for the reason of a bit less roast malt bitterness, but for those who like a good Stout with those characteristics, this is a real winner.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

I hold my glass up to a light bulb and still cant see through it. I notice dark malt aromas with some roasted as well. Definite smells of dark dark chocolate. Taste is smooth, and body pretty cloying. Im not noticing the coffee flavors as much, but more of the dark chocolate and dark roasted malts.

450,"2004-12-10",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2004 Thanks to Mr. Facto for this beer.

Pours onyx black with a brown head that left a film on the beer.  This may be the blackest stout Ive seen thus far.  Aroma is fainter than I expected, but is a quite agreeable roasted coffee.  Flavor is predominately bittersweet chocolate with some coffee, with a subtle sweetness and a bitter roasted character to the finish.  The palate is extremely silky and thick, like wrapping the entirety of the mouth in a down comforter.  My only complaints are that the aroma and taste, though complex and quite balanced, are not as pronounced as I would like.  The real treat to this beer is the mouthfeel.  I think I may have a soft spot for the Java Stout more, but I can certainly appreciate the artistry that goes into this beer.  Overall Im becoming more and more impressed by Bells stouts, and I never cease to be amazed at how heavy they sit in the stomach.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Im sure that has something to do with this. Freaking Awesome beer!!! Definitely changes my mind on Bells. Oberon I thought was bad. Cherry Stout was ok, but its a stout not a fruit beer. Kalamazoo is terrific. Restores my faith in this breweries ability to produce great beer. Chocolately, roasty, smooth, creamy, Im enamoured once again with Bells.

450,"2004-05-24",3.3,"It pours opaque black with a very generous, long-lasting sticky tan head in my fin du monde glass (great with stouts I find). Aroma displays very creamy malt, I could have believed this was a milk stout. Roasted chocolate and burnt coffee grains complement the sweetness. Very round and full mouthfeel, creamy. Particularly low carbonation. Alcohol hint accompanies the restrained bitterness in the finish-> alcool which I thought should not be felt at all in a 6.5% beer with all that roasted malt. Once again, this stout got this milky aspect that I came to dislike when combined with an almost still mouthfeel. It feels, not unlike a wine, just dead in the mouth despite all the licorice, molasses, chocolatey flavors from the dark malts. Well done, but still severly overrated to my tastes and definitely nowhere near as complex as expedition. Smooth, yet ultimately close, but no cigar.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

450,"2004-05-20",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2007 Pours an opaque black/brown with a thick, dense, creamy light brown head - perfect. Beautiful roasty, mocha aroma which picks up a subtle smokiness and malted milk balls as it warms. The flavor is a lovely mix of roasted malt, dark toasted grain/caramel, coffee, dark chocolate, mocha and hops. Thick and rich with that perfect level of sweetness and prominent, but not astringent roastiness. Mouthfeel is very full, round and ridiculously velvety/creamy - perfect. Great head retention, thick lacing left on the glass. In my opinion, this is the best stout money can buy. Why? Because its a breath of fresh air against the multitude of weak, clear and painfully boring stouts. Proper appearance, aroma, sweetness, roastiness, hoppiness, mouthfeel- even the artwork and packaging is superior. To top it all off, its very drinkable. A total masterpiece.

Previous Rating = 3.6
A thick creamy brown head tops this deep brown almost black beer.  Thick aromas of coffee, burnt malt, alcohol, and chocolate waft from my glass.  Aaah, a thick creamy body that is quite satisfying and hits the spot after the weak porter that I just had.  Finishes with an astringent roast malt character.  The beer is so creamy that it balances the roast character, in the front and middle of this beer, quite well.  Perhaps a hint of diacetyl, but it is barely perceptible.  Not really sweet, despite the ample body.  After a bit of time I can detect some buttery diacetyl in the aroma, perhaps a bit distracting, but not all that bad.  This beer would be something else if the diacetyl was cleaned up a bit.  Having said that, if you dont mind a bit of diacetyl, this would be a really good beer for you.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

There are flavors of maple, anise, and more, a sweet, spicy melange that is a treat to enjoy at every occasion.

Massive notes of grains are inhaled with every sip. DAMN!! The flavor is tremendous!! Insane suggestions of oak, long notes of chocolate and toffee, also a hint on bourbon, which brings an inner warmth with each sip.

450,"2004-01-26",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2006 Very dark beer... average head with brown color. Excellent lacing. Aroma is chocolate/coffee with some brown sugar and oak/cask.  Swirling brings slight bitter notes to nose. First time I had this I thought it was too sour in the middle. It is more of a creamy roast chocolate coffee flavor now. Finish is a bit of tasty bitter coffee. Overall, its a good pleasant drink... maybe the first bottle I had was weird.
Update - Finally rerating... Batch 7061 (bottled 9/15/2005, sampled 6/30/2006). Not going to add much as I simply enjoyed it. Nice overall stout, bordering on the sweet side. Great drink.

450,"2004-01-24",4.2,"1/24/04.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with igneous1 on RateBeer 1/21/04.  Pours an amazing dark opaque brown, almost black, with just hints of chocolate brown on the edges of the glass when you hold it up to a bright light.  Lots of sediment (although you can't really see it through the dark body) and a very thick appearance.  Chocolate brown head, good sized but rocky and not that long-lasting.  Simply outstanding lacing on the glass, though.  A different kind of stout.  Nose is terrific, of creamy dark coffee malts and hints of chocolate.  Mouth-wateringly good.  I had this beer a long time ago, and I can tell I'm going to love it again.  Flavor is equally darkly malty and tartly chocolatey, bits of a sweet and dry stout mixed together.  Very creamy, velvety body and terrifically smooth finish.  Just a tad bit too dry and sour for me on a sweet stout, although the complexity of those flavors adds a nice depth to the overall quality of the beer.  As you swallow, the beer just swallows with you-- sucking the inky moisture out of your mouth and leaving behind a residue of burnt chocolate-espresso goodness.  Quite oily for a medium-bodied beer.  It's incredibly easy to drink without being even close to ordinary.  A fantastic session beer.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

It's good, but I was expecting it to be a little better.  Nose is chocolatey, but has a metallic note to it.  Taste is kind of the same.  It starts of with a cocoa taste then turns a little metallic with a dry bitter finish.  It tastes like the Bison choc stout, but this is better.  Very good, but not my favorite.  Rerate:  This is growing on me.  Still has some metallic flavoring to it, but it's pretty good.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"

Excellent.","Apple Valley, Minnesota, USA","Nexxus"

450,"2003-11-08",4.8,"This is my favorite stout so far!  This has the roasted barley flavor that is missing from most stouts.  Enough hop bitterness to balance the malt, but not overdone as is so common with American ales.  The head was not long lasting and perhaps that is its only defect (if that can count as one).  Also, I think this stout is more of a dry stout than a sweet stout, except perhaps for the higher gravity (approaching that of a low gravity imperial stout).","Coon Rapids, Minnesota, USA","Veldy"

Scents of the finest chocolate in the world tease the nostrils. A bit of hop spiciness mixed in as well. Truly delicious aroma. The taste is strong on dark, bittersweet chocolate. A nice sweetness follows, as well as defined roasted notes. The finish presents more fruity chocolate, with a wisp of smoke. A bit of vanilla is present as well, mixed in with the solid malt flavor in the background. As you can tell, this is one very complex beer. I also sense a bit of nuttiness in there as well. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and shows a moderate body. Not as thick as some sweet stouts, but flavor is what this beer is all about.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"

Smoky burnt malt aroma with hints of berry/plum fruits, wood, espresso, bittersweet chocolate, and interesting spice. Opens up with a large smoky and bitter taste, some malty chocolate sweetness appears midway through the swallow, and the finish is twangy and dry. Sweet stout my arse! Maybe we have a new substyle: smoked stout? I know one thing for sure, this would be a nice brew to have with smoked salmon. The palate is interesting as well, Creamy yet dry, fizzy yet soft, seemed to change each and every time I took a gulp.

450,"2003-08-06",3.3,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2010 2010: This is a stout that drinks much bigger than it is. If that is a good or bad thing, depends on your mood I guess. The color is black, the head is medium tan and the lacing clings to the side in patches. Its a nice looking beer. The nose is roast, chocolate and some toasty malts. This is a heavy beer for the gravity, quite sweet but matched a strong hop bitterness and a slight tartness. It is thick and rich to the point where it sacrifices some drinkabilty. I like it fine but if Im buying a dark, roasty beer made in Michigan, these days I am much more likely to pull out something a bit more on the dry side like Founders Porter but this is still a decent cold weather brew for sure.

2003: Very dark, ""utterly opaque"" as per the commercial description. Big, thick, brown long lasting head. Roasty, lightly vinous, with notes of coffee, caramel, and raisins. This is a big beer.

450,"2003-07-23",4.6,"One of my favorite stouts. Very black and insanely roasty, yet balanced with sweetness and a meek creaminess that grows on you.

Some hazelnut also and figs.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

450,"2003-07-18",3.5,"Completely black in colour...no light shines through at all. Lustrous brown head which settles nicely and stays atop for a long time. Chocolate and molasses in the smell, just as the label says. Only malt is evident in the smell...almost no sign of hops. Light to medium bodied with the definate roasty flavours coating the mouth. The bitterness stays for quite a while in the mouth and subsides only after a few minutes. While this may sound a lot like the rating before me (by JonR888710), his bottle came from my six-pack, and perhaps we got some that were old or have gone through some hell. I'll definately try this again the next time i'm out in Michigan...but until then i've got a few left from the rest of the 6 pack. I really was expecting more from the look and smell of the beer...but it wasn't as bad as some other stouts i've had!

450,"2003-07-14",3.4,"Black, viscous body (99% opaque) with a toasted cream head that gingerly subsides. Smells like an open bag of chocolate cookies. Beer gently washes over the tongue; not as thick as I’d expected. Taste is roasted-chocolate, with sweet malt characteristics, overabundant carbonation and a little watery.  Aftertaste is chocolate, transforming to coffee flavored hops. The hops leave a lingering bitterness that smashes against the roof of the mouth, leaving a dent of bad taste that won’t go away. Sad really, for this is a gorgeous beer. The body is the darkest I’ve ever seen, it laces the glass nicely, and millions of little bubbles pop their heads at the surface like a plethora of prairie dogs. But the taste fell far short of what I was expecting and landed smack dab in the middle of average.

When I first had this beer it was back early in my rating and drinking career. I just did not like stouts for anything and it was way too early for me to be having this monster. So on my Michigan brewery tour we stopped in at bells and had it fresh on tap. WOW, this beer is great. Black with no head really. But the nose was clean with coffee and rich rich beans. The taste was simple, crisp and clean. Alcohol was present but not overly. In fact, I can say that this is definately one of the best stouts, regular ole stouts, that I have had.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"

450,"2003-06-24",4.5,"Good color of a solid stout, very dark brown, nearly black with super deep ruby amber highlights up to the light. Thin creamy foamed head of a very tan brown, looks like a pancake cooking. Strange glaring, hazy, spotty lace. Smell is a very nice sweetly dark chocolatey tone, roasty, with notes of earthy fresh hops, dark fruits of banana, cherry, and starfruit. One excellent nose on this stout. Taste is a medley of bold and rich chocolate malts and some caramel malts noted, roasty/toasty and thinly sweet, mostly covered in chocolateyness, dark and close to espresso-like in its earthyness and bitterness. Mostly middle flavors is where it goes complex on your taste buds. Perfect balance with the late hops, notes of dark coffee beans and roasted pecans. Very nice stout indeed. Feel is beautifully full, pleasurable, luscious, rich, creamy, with a late tangy dryness holding forever it seems on the roof of my mouth. One yummy, scrumptious stout. Another Bell's goody thats deserving of notoriety.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

450,"2003-06-12",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2004 2002 draft.  Brownish amber color with some dark tones.  Nice roasty, slightly coffee aroma.  Does not disappoint.  A good halfway between the java stout and the trumpeter stout.  Had some head, which most bells stouts lack, so that was nice.  Mostly even roasty notes, with some sharp/watery notes in and out of the body,  but otherwise a good medium full bodied stout with some spiced mocha latte appeal that was pleasant.  As it warmed some smoked flavor appeared but still had problems with the thinness.  I enjoyed the fact that this stout was not overbearing, like the java or susies or cherry.  2003 bottle.  Creamier and chocolatier than I remember.  Very smooth, silky almost.  There is a potent roasted malt on the finish and some bitter hops throughout, but all in all, pretty tame.  But also pretty good.  My friend thinks this tastes like an ash tray (and between the smoke, bitter roast and initial acidic/sour twang, I can see where hes coming from)","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

450,"2003-04-16",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 10, 2006 11/10/06 re-rate: Rich, sweet, chocolate aroma with hints of lactose. Dark black body with a tan head and excellent lace. Its remarkable that a beer that is as sweet as this, is as low in alcohol as it is. Not that this is overly sweet or cloying at all. Tastes like an imperial stout light. Im not as overwhelmed with this brew this time around as the first time. Good flavor and very well made, just not a ""wow"" beer. Im not going to change my ratings for it as I might only dock the aroma by a point and the overall by a point. 4/16/03: Rich, chocolatety aroma with oak notes. Completely black/opaque body with large brown, rootbeer float-like head; mostly lasting. Wonderfully thick lace. Sweet enough to be a porter...or a sweet stout. Chocolatety with oak and a chalky finish. A very good stout. Started to sour a bit upon warming like the Bells Porter, but it was a false alarm. Very good.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
450,"2003-04-15",3.3,"Inveigler smuggled this over from Michigan in his backpack. This is clearly his favourite beer - and it's easy to see why. A good creamy pour with a delightfully soft coffee coloured head. A malty nose, mostly dry and dusty, but with a hint of Horlicks, and a scraping of dark Belgian chocolate. The initial mouthfeel is double cream soft, but that soon settles into a smooth dryness. The taste is of an intense dry bitterness which seems divided between hops and roast malt. There is fruit in the background, and a molasses sweetness, but that doesn't make itself felt strongly enough against the bitterness. This reminds me of Guinness from many years ago. The nose remains interesting all the way through, with aged oak making itself felt now and again. An intense and well made stout, but just a little too brutal and unbalanced for me. The occasional fruit and nestles milk at the back of the throat do not really compensate for the relentlessly tub thumping orchestral bitterness.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Double Cream Stout is sweeter and creamier, while this one puts primary focus on the roasted flavors.  Kalamazoo Stout is still surprisingly sweet, unless you drink one after drinking a Mackeson XXX or Double Cream Stout.  Thick, dark, and rich, this is a bargain stout.

Dark, dark brown with a tan head.  Aroma was a subdued chocolate/coffee.  But the taste was overwhelming, the kind where you shake your head, looking at the beer like it has just hit you in the mouth and you cant wait to get another.

450,"2003-01-19",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2006 This is a stout that fully represents the style: bold roastiness, strong chocolate, almost milky in its texture.  There was some sourness in the middle however that was a bit shocking.  I havent tasted this in other Bells beers.  Has anyone else noticed this?  Without the sourness I would rate MUCH higher.

Re-rate June 06- this is the absolute best non-imperial stout. Perfect hop addition to a thick, creamy, roasty beer. Outstanding

I didn't expect the sweetness and was a bit thrown off at first, but i qucikly changed my mind.  This beer looked great and tasted better.  The texture in my mouth was very nice, and the flavor was there from the beginning to end of each wonderful sip.  I definatly need to try this one again.
Rerate:
A definite sweet chocolate aroma, malts and carmel too.  A brownish, almost black body, and don't try to see through it either.  A decent sized head that lasted and was of the tan variety.  Wonderful taste.  The chocolate and malts blend together nicely and then there is a bit of sweetness with molasses  It finishes with a lingering bitterness that is just awesome.  Super creamy mouthfeel makes it easy on the mouth.  Very drinkable and very tasty.  I needed to retaste this one and I'm so glad I did.","Rowlett, Texas, USA","flemdawg"

Odd undertone to the nose, what hey_kevin referred to as a ""typical Bells Stout nose"".  Not sure what it is, maybe a bit acidic, a bit sour?  Very, very dry, hoppy at finish.  Again, a bit sour in the flavor.  Very roasty, rich, nice chocolate sweetness to it.  Certainly not thin, but not fat of incredibly chewy; is, in short, INSANELY drinkable stuff.  Very creamy, plays about the mouth nicely.  Excellent.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"

The aroma is fantastic and rich and smells like bakers chocolate.  The flavor is complex but there are plenty of hints of coffee, chocolate and the tiniest almost imperceptible hint of anise.  To truly enjoy this beer, start cold and then drink over about an 1 hour period.  Notice the changing flavors as you work your way through the glass.  If I were to die a pharaoh, I would want a clay pot of this brew left for me as a daily offering.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
450,"2002-07-18",4.5,"Black in color; head was sticky all over the glass; burnt, burnt malt and coffee beans in the nose. The perfect everyday stout- screw guinness, what a joke. This beer sits with you and demands little. Creamy coffee with hints at mocha. Wonderful to just linger over and contemplate your next world changing ideaa.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
450,"2002-07-16",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2004 RERATE:  More acidic and burning than I remember. Flavors still there just more burning.  7/16/02 Thick very dark brown with a sparkling dark tan, small bubbled head. Aroma starts with roasted coffee and barley and as it warms caramel and alcohol.  Dark chocolate, sweet roasted malt and coffee dominate the flavors.  Carbonation is a bit biting on the tongue.  A very bitter finish, but the bitterness disipates quickly to a nice roasted/toasted lingering.  A Mackesons with a bit more kick.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
450,"2002-07-12",4.2,"This pours so thick and black that I almost went for the scissors.  You can not see light through this beer.  It has a rocky tan head and leaves great lace on the glass.  The nose is strong with burnt coffee.  The first sips coat the mouth with roast coffee and chocalate malt tastes.  As it warms up the burnt toast flavors balance against a caramel sweetness and buttery smoothness.  This has a real big beer feel to it and is very well balanced for its size.  A very nice stout.  I wish I had another.  Maybe in the back of the fridge...","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
450,"2002-07-09",3.6,"Great taste -- strong taste of bitter chocolate, bitter coffee and dark malt -- a little thin, perhaps, but thats OK. The aroma puts me off, though, which keeps this from being a truly great stout.","USA","beerlovinman99"
450,"2002-07-09",4.0,"Deep opaque mahogony or cherrywood color with a medium tan head that totally went away.  Aroma is roasted malt and bitter chocolate.  Initial taste is also bitter chocolate and roasted malt.  As it warms, it settles into a creamy milk chocolate flavor enveloping coffee and burnt flavors.  Just a hint of bitterness in the end.  Nice and full.  A great brew.  Thanks to proc.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

450,"2002-06-21",4.3,"Pours with big, tightly carbonated dark brown head. Black in color - motor oil lie. Medium strength nose of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and slight dry hoppy notes. Crisp and chewy palate. Roasted flavors of coffee, bittersweet chocolate and just a touch of yeast acidity on the front end. Long and big finish of bitter coffee. Nice to see a big stout not over-hopped!! Very flavorful stout of solid quality.","Orange County, California, USA","bigal9699"
450,"2002-06-19",3.9,"Strong and rich.  not quite as smooth and sweet as their double cream stout.  this had  a much stronger coffee flavor.  medium to thin finish.  Bells darker brews are soo much better than their lighter ones. (my opinion)","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"

450,"2002-06-11",4.0,"This is an excellent stout, definitely a benchmark for stouts.  Aroma was a little off...sweet beef jerky almost?  I dont know what to say.  Typical stout characteristics but done very well. It had an excellent bittersweet finish.  yum!","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"

450,"2002-05-30",4.2,"Very black color, which was well appreciated.  Chocalate and oat nose, with strong roasted malt flavor, a hint of chocolate and coffee, and a nice bitter malt finish.  One of the better Bells beers.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","SJP"
450,"2002-05-24",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2005 Nice slowly settling head on a jet black body.  Huge coffee/caramel aroma mixed with aromatic hops.  Burnt/chocolate taste that is slightly different with each sip.  Smooth mouthfeel.  A beer that needs much swirling and slow sipping for sure.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
450,"2002-05-23",4.1,"Struck me as more of a porter than a stout.  Strong coffee smell and flavor.  Handsome appearance and head.  The only problem was the acidity in the taste that I didnt much care for.  My first Bells beer and hopefully not my last.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
450,"2002-05-11",4.3,"This is a big beer, make no mistake.  It took me 3 bottles to figure the rating.  This brew pours a solid black with a creamy, mostly
lasting head the color of creamed coffee.  The lacing is good.   The complex nose changes
several times as the brew breathes (which I would highly recommend unless you prefer
your beer to smell like Band-Aids and medicine while you drink it).  When first poured
heavy malt dominates with notes of strong coffee.  Resin and flowers make up the hop
end, with soap, spice, anise, cola and alcohol bringing up the rear.  As the Band-Aid and
medicine smell dissipate, pleasant caramel remains.   The flavor improves GREATLY as the brew
warms.  If consumed cold the flavor walks a thin line between robust and harsh.  As it
softens, the rich complexity develops.  A sweet fruity/flowery spiciness is at the front with a long roasted bitter black coffee
finish.  The full body has soft carbonation and coats the tongue like cough syrup.  The
finish feels astringent and somewhat chalky.  Not for pussies.  The Expedition Stout must be INSANE.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

450,"2002-04-12",4.6,"This is definitely one of Bells best beers.  Outstanding chocolate, coffe flavors and good hop balance.  Sometimes the alcohol comes through a little strong, but somehow that doesnt seem to matter.","somerville, Massachusetts, USA","Hugerat"
450,"2002-04-03",3.6,"A top notch stout in anyones book. Re-rate:  Good roasted/chocolate flavor and nice hop bitterness but too damn carbonated for me.  Had to rate this one a little lower the 2nd time around.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"

450,"2002-02-19",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 18, 2006 Pours with traditional Bells creamy top. Estery aroma is fruity with abundant roast to match. Fluffy and airy on the palate. Opens with a metallic sweep of malt and beefy licorice notes. Hugely charred toward the end, with black cherries soon bringing balance to the overall intensity. Finishes with black coffee and deeply earthy roasted malts. Has become overly grainy and worty in the last year. Not nearly as good as I recall.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

450,"2002-01-26",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2003 Shares with the Bell's double cream stout an intial tanginess, coupled with moderate carbonation despite the lack of head (hey, how do they do that?). Then after the initial flavor rush you get full blown roasted flavor. Creamy, nice, very nice.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
450,"2002-01-16",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2004 A rich, opaque stout with nice coffee aroma.  Indulgent flavors include hazelnuts, molasses, chocolate covered coffee beans and caramel malt.

This is the most interesting Bells I;ve had. Amazing full velvet feel slips away fairly clean and light with a bit of acid on the tail. The burned roast adds to the bitter-side of the excellent balance. lots of hoppy bitter melding with the roast bitterness. very nicw.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
450,"2001-10-29",3.9,"The look on that guys face says it all about this stout. I really dislike alomost everything from bells and this is no exception. Overly strong with a bad taste.

450,"2001-10-05",4.0,"Bells makes better beers, but barely.  This one has really fascinating alternations of unsweetned chocolate and burnt molasses.

450,"2001-06-21",4.2,"Full bodied, well roasted - a little bitter (which is fine). A good stout in a bottle.  Needs to breathe a little before drinking - always use a glass.  I found the second half of the glass to be better than the first.","New Boston, Michigan, USA","djackson3311599"
