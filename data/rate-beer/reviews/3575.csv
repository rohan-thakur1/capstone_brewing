3575,"2016-03-24",3.8,"Bottle thanks to a trade. Pour is lightly cloudy, deep gold, with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of lemon and light minerals and salt. Taste is medium tartness with a hint of salt. Lightly floral, but definitely not very perfume (light coriander, which I like). A super crushable and sessionable gose. Really good, but I would like to see just a tad more sourness and a tad more salt.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"

3575,"2015-07-19",3.0,"Pour into tulip glass hazy copper straw color with fluffy white head. Aroma is heavy cereal grains, fritos, funky barnyard horseblanket, light lemon, and coriander. Taste is better then the smell with the cat pee and frito chips less present but still grainy and off tasting to me. Not the best effort here.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
3575,"2015-07-19",3.8,"750ml bottle thanks to Reynolds (whom I will respectfully disagree with in the ratings) in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma of the classical SARA yeast tartness/funk/awesome, some pale malts and wheat, very very light notes of salt and coriander, and some hints of oak. Flavor just seems like they added a tiny bit of salt and coriander to Saison Bernice. Average texture. A good beer, but its not really a gose in my opinion. Its just a SARA beer where they made an experimental beer and it turned out good because their cultures are so awesome.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"

3575,"2015-01-18",3.7,"Bottle at Chriss place. Vomit driven funky nose. Tart, big lactose character, very salty, coriander, nauseating thing that I recall from Leipzig. Challenging, precisely because it is by far the most authentic gose Ive had from a U.S. brewery. Solid.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
3575,"2015-01-07",2.8,"Bottle via bottle share at The Libertine in Morro Bay. Pours a medium yellow with small white head. Aroma is urinal cake, yeast, rotten eggs, slight funk. Taste is slightly vegetal forward with a big sweetart forward finish. Sweet sour is not that great in this. Slight salt in the finish. Meh.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
3575,"2014-12-19",3.6,"On tap at the brewery. 
Aroma is slightly acidic and citrus. Moderate phenolic notes with coriander. A bit poopy with a light graininess. 
Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with a large, white head with decent retention as it recedes to the edges. No leaving and small legs. 
Flavor is moderately tart with a light grain note. Hints of overripe stone fruit and faint tropical fruit. Medium light bitterness. Moderate phenolic not, slightly plastic. Light saltiness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.
Overall, nice acidity and citrus note with good salt, but the phenolics from the yeast is a bit off.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3575,"2014-12-18",3.4,"Bottle, 16e label, shared by bytemesis. Thanks Mike! Aroma is extra funky and yeasty, with moderate guava, dough and eggy sulfur the closer to the bottom of the bottle you get. Its not quite the familiar house culture as the saisons. The beer pours murky pale yellow with small white head that hangs out for a majority of the glass. Taste is ripe stone fruits, some peach juice, guava, and apricot skin funk. The longer the beer hangs out on the tongue, the more salt comes through on the palate. However, not picking up on any coriander, as the fruit is the dominate flavor. The body is medium-full, somewhat creamy with soft carbonation. After taste is funky fruit, yeast and dough. Overall a pretty damn funky and smelly beer, but the taste is fruity and refreshing.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3575,"2014-12-18",3.6,"Bottle. Pours hazy golden, small white head, a bit of lacing. Lots of yeasty residue floating on the surface. Aroma is funk-forward, barnyard, some sulfur, rotten eggs, lemon. Flavor is light tart, lemony, some saltiness on the finish. Still fairly funky, but less so than the nose indicates, and without that sulfuric component (thankfully). Fairly full body for the style, creamy mouthfeel, a bit of that silky mineral water feel that HF is known for. This is a solid beer. I guess I was hoping for a ""Gose Gone Wild"" clone, but this is something else entirely, and stands on its own two feet.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3575,"2014-12-10",4.2,"A- pours a foggy straw yellow. Frothy white head at first that thins quickly. Virtually zero lacing.

S- sea salt and air have a pleasant sting up front. Very fruity: perfectly ripe lemons and oranges with some stone fruit and guava. Faint lime too. A buffet of citrus. Coriander is light but there. Some 7up, honey and yeasty bits. Slight sulfur at first.

M- light to medium tart body with some creaminess. Nice carb.

T- wonderful citrus combo right away: oranges, limes, passion fruits. Salt carries into the middle. Sweet cream butter. Middle turns sweeter with honey and some light malty resin and apricots. Coriander start to come through more in towards the end along with soda water, more lime, lemon, and grasses.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3575,"2012-08-12",4.1,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a dark pumpkin color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is stone fruits and mild saltiness, funk and banana. Flavor is vivid dried apricots with mild coriander and brine. Really fruity, brett C, high carbonation.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
