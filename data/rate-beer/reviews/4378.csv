4378,"2014-12-24",3.5,"Keg at CASC. It pours pretty much black with a small beige head. The nose is bitter-sweet, vimto, juicy red grape, blueberry, roasted malt, earth, treacle and candied citrus peel. The taste is a bitter, rich roast, earth, resin, umami, charred wood, ash, treacle, tarry, alcohol hit, cola and a touch citrus with a very dry, roasty finish. Full body and high carbonation. I really like the fruity vimto action on the nose, but the taste is a bit drying unfortunately. Decent.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
4378,"2014-12-04",4.1,"Shared tallboy can. Pours deep, dark brown with creamy beige head. Aroma is roasted malts, dark chocolate, earthy notes, spicy hops, and faint dark fruit esters. Flavor matches the aroma with rich roast and chocolate flavors that are blended perfectly with the strong hop character; dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.","Federal Hill, Baltimore, Maryland, USA","sonnycheeba"
4378,"2014-11-02",3.8,"Tap sample. Poured clear black with an average to large frothy tan head that mostly lasted with very good lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt and earthy hop aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy dark bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a very good complex beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4378,"2014-11-01",3.8,"Tap...fantastic aroma leads the way to a rich and complex beer with nice floral hop high notes, a fresh cut lawn in the middle over a roasted and chocolaty base. Very good.","Peoples Republic of Bloomington, Indiana, USA","paintedmaple"
4378,"2014-07-13",4.0,"Pours black with a two finger tan head with nice lacing. Aroma is lightly roasted malts, coco, sweet malts, smoke, and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma with addition of some pine and grassy hops. Has a medium body with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a slightly dry, semi bitter, medium finish. Overall, a pretty nice black IPA that is on the maltier side of the styles spectrum.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
4378,"2014-06-15",3.6,"Pour out of 16 oz can, dark brownish black with off white head, aroma brought notes of roast, coffee, cocoa, hints of orange peel and grapefruit, pretty nice. Taste is a mix of roast, coffee, cocoa, hints of pine, orange, some grapefruit, finishing fairly bitter. Pretty tasty, but nothing outstanding.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4378,"2014-06-13",3.5,"Draft. Clear Dark mahogany. Small tan head, partly lasting. Medium body. Creamy and oily. Moderate bitterness smooth out by the right amount of sweetness. Finish doesnt overly linger, making for pretty good deniability. Not much roastiness or other dark character that I can find. Its hop forward and more in the IPA side of things. Resiny. A good beer just not a lot of character.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
4378,"2014-06-06",3.9,"16 oz can poured a clear dark reddish brown with a lasting tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, charcoal, grapefruit zest, cocoa, pine and earthiness.

Flavors of charcoal, cocoa, roasted malt, earthiness, pine and light grapefruit zest with a crisp dry bitter lingering roasty finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
4378,"2014-05-24",4.4,"Black pour under a thick foamy light cream hued head. Big grassy resiny nose with a smooth sweet roast malt quality and some roasty earthy caramel...loads of grassy dry hop resins on the aroma. Big huge hop flavor with a smooth body full of sweet earthy roasted malt, a touch of smoke, loooads of dank grassy resins and floral/leafy tones. Smooth semisweet roasty black malt finish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

4378,"2014-04-26",3.4,"On tap @ Pizza Port Bressi Ranch. Black/dark brown pour with a finger of off-white head. Hoppy, earthy, citrusy aroma. Lots of nuts, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of licorice. Lots of pine and grapefruit peel. Taste is slightly acidic and fairly bitter. Lots of roasted malt, coffee, licorice, and dark chocolate. Really herbal, grassy, and piney hops. Mild/moderate citrus notes. Not bad.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

4378,"2014-04-20",3.4,"16 oz can. Pours dark brown with a big rocky tan head that retains well and laces the glass.

The aroma is sweet roasted caramel malts with a little fruit and piney hops.

The flavor is sweet caramel malt, roast and some piney fruity hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little watery.

Overall, tastes like a decent, but sweet, black IPA. I dont see much difference with it being a lager.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
