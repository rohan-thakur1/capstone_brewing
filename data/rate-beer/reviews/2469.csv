2469,"2016-08-14",3.9,"This is for the 2009 release. Ive been hanging onto this forever, figure Id finally open it and enter a rating for the first time in a while. Pours copper with a thin wispy head, which is a welcome sign as I expected zero carbonation. Nose is malt-forward, with ripe apples, pears, pie crust. A good late summer into fall beer reminiscent of other ice bocks and even some maltier Octoberfest beers. Mouth is nicely prickly. Again all kinds of big malt flavors, much in the range of stewed apples and pie crust. Faint oxidation on the finish but its not much of a detractor. Thick, pleasantly sweet but not nearing cloying. Nice stuff, not sure Id trade a ton for another bottle but its an enjoyable rare treat!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

2469,"2016-04-10",3.5,"Poured from a 187 ml bottle. Bottle # 17/110 vintage 2014. 
Aroma is rather malty with lots of caramel, burnt sugar and bit of toffee. Some moderate honey notes with a bit of alcohol. Medium raisin and other dried fruits. 
Pours a hazy, reddish copper color with a small, thin, whit head that recedes to a thin film that lingers in the center. No lacing and long legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with some caramel, burnt sugar and light toffee notes. Quite a bit of alcohol spice. Lots of honey and apple juice oxidation with a touch of wet paper. Medium bitterness. Light raisin and fig notes. Hints of dried stone fruit. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with almost no carbonation. Low astringency and medium high alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an interesting beer but not great. Lots of alcohol and it tastes a bit oxidized. Some decent fruit notes, but it seems to lack the complexity necessary to hide so much alcohol.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

2469,"2014-09-25",4.4,"Bottle, #98/100, 2006 vintage. This bottle came from Eyedrinkale in a trade like a million years ago, rate 5000 seemed like a good excuse to crack it open. Pours a beautiful ruby tinged amber body, completely still, it coats the glass with a sticky film after a good swirl. The nose reminds me of a really really well aged Thomas Hardys. Excellent sherry like oxidation that complements the heavy malt character rather than dominates. Big dark fruits, thick caramel, rather moderate alcohol notes given the huge ABV. Smells just perfect for an 8 year old big beer. The flavor is pretty solid as well, the heavy malt is softened and rounded out well by the oxidation, lots of caramel, fig, and a deceptively light alcohol warmth on the finish. Very easy sipper, might be the most drinkable 17% beer Ive ever come across. Shame that its only a 7oz bottle. The mouthfeel is just about still, maybe a hint of carbonation, but not much. Its mouth coating, but not sticky or clingy at all, it almost starts out a bit thin, but build well. A nice gentle alcoholic warmth on the finish. Excellent beer, I wish this beer were easier to obtain, I think Id drink a lot of this.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Vintages 2006 & 2009, served side by side.

2006 bottle 23/100
2009 bottle 8/75

The 2006 vintage appears remarkably darker than the 2009, which appears orange colored. Neither beer displays any head or leaves any trace of lacing on the glass.

The aroma offers apples, grapes, English malts, toffee.

The flavor is sweet, but not nearly as much as I was expecting, certainly not cloying. Although the beers drastically differ in appearance, they smell and taste nearly identical. The beer drinks almost like an apple / grape liqueur, or an after dinner cordial. The bready, biscuity, English malt character is present in the flavor, but plays only a subtle role.

The feel is thin and light, with virtually no carbonation. Like sipping a strong white wine or alcoholic white grape juice.

Overall, this was quite a treat, and especially cool to try not one, but two vintages of this rare delicacy.

2469,"2011-04-27",3.4,"A: The pour is golden orange in color with a mild chill haze.  Really no head or carbonation to it at all.  Not that this should come as a surprise.

S: Smells slightly oxidized with a bit of a stale brown sugar note up front.  Certainly sweet and malty as I had anticipated, but very minimal booze presence.  Some fruits such as golden plums and raisins, and a floral honey character is also there.

T: Quite the fruity flavor here.  Light peaches to go along with the golden plum and raisin thing.  Caramel, brown sugar, and mild alcohol which actually is a good thing (I think) in this beer.  Mild honey characteristics on the palate as well.

M: Not quite as full in body as I had anticipated.  And while there is essentially no carbonation, its not syrupy, which is a plus.

O: I was expecting this to just be disgustingly boozy, but it was actually nicely hidden (especially for 18%).  A nice beer to try, but not amazing.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2469,"2011-04-21",3.3,"Thanks to Azurelimits for opening this 187mL bottle at a recent tasting. Served in a snifter.

Pours an orange-honey color with a thin, bubbly white head. Much better looking than I would have expected given the alcohol volume on this. Seems to be pretty carbonated. White bubbly head does subside quite quickly, however, and only leaves behind a few legs on the side of the glass. The nose is quite striking with a very strong, sweet honey-like presence to start out along with quite a bit of alcohol. There is also some slight peach and melon characteristics.

The taste isnt quite as fruity and is more toward sugar overkill. Its balanced out by a good dose of booze, but Im not sure these are really the two things Id like to have balancing one another out. Medium body with low levels of carbonation. Sugar and alcohol just end up making up too much of this beer and I wasnt terribly impressed, though I did quite enjoy the nose.

This beer was the driving force behind the crazy number of people standing in line 2 1/2 hours before the opening in 12 degree cold with a brisk wind.  First, a tip of the hat to the folks at SPH for coming up with the idea of numbering the sheets so we could all split and take off to warmer locales.  As for this beer, I wonder if all of the anticipation and expectations influenced my reaction to this beer.  While I enjoyed having it last night, it didnt blow me away.  Pours clear and is a combination of gold and rose, and is quite beautiful.  There is a very thin and brief linen white head.  Not as aromatic as I was expecting, despite the fact that I only slightly chilled the bottle.  The aroma is predominantly malt and brandy, with alcohol vapors very noticeable, which is no surprise given the 18% abv.  The flavor is malt with some fruitiness, not very sweet, with noticeable alcohol warmth towards the finish.  The texture is not as vinous or full as I was expecting.  There is a dryness that rises on the tongue after swallow, lingers for about ten seconds, and then recedes.  This one is certainly a sipper and I enjoyed the hour and a half I spent with this beer.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

Intense, butterscotch/caramel hard-candies that I can almost crunch, dried fruits and lots of it, dessert biscuits, and yes plenty of alcohol.

I instructed and performed the monkey dance (which isnt sexual, as it sounds) with EDA and a Canadian in the hopes of encouraging another bottle of this to be opened.  I had just started up with a cigar, so I performed said monkey dance, pitched the majority of a cigar into the nearby campfire, and proceeded to cleanse my palate and thoughtfully rate this by flashlight.  I love BCTC.  Pours a dark, ruby-red color; headless. Dense, chewy caramel and dried red fruits in the aroma.  Full, viscous mouthfeel: dense, boozy candy sugar and maple syrup upfront; huge show of alcohol and sugary warmth; dense dried tropical fruits; fiercely dense, aggressive eisbock, even after a few years.

Poured a clear, fiery medium orange with only a very light dusting and a light ring of yellowy-beige head.  The whole drink was a full-on assault on the senses... The aroma carried rich and syrupy caramel, Port-infused darker fruits, toasted sourdough bread, buttery cream, oak, and peppery spices... alcohol burned through a few stray nose hairs.  This was creamy and exeptionally clean on the palate... with alcohol burning the tip of the tongue and greatly warming the finish (although it remained complimentary the whole way).  The flavor began with mild Port wine, white pepper, and herbal bitterness stinging the tip of the tongue... transitioning into rich caramel, toffee, brown sugar, biscuits, and alcohol-fueled dark fruits... ending with warm caramel and white pepper again in the long, warm finish.  This was most intriguing and enjoyable!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

2469,"2006-07-21",3.9,"Light amber color, with a small ring of lacing. I would have liked it to be a darker more amber/ruby like color. 

Fairly rich and nice nose (though not overly interesting and complex,) with fresh biscuit-like malt, apple, plum, peach and fairly refined alcohol. 

Initially a bit sparse and husky and fairly underwhelming until the mid-palate. After that, creamy, buttery, caramel and fruit filled malt roam about, combined with a rich and luscious, huge and succulant body, especially after the mid-palate. Overall, it could be a bit more concentrated and richer up front, the finish could be longer and it could be a little sweeter as well. Overall, this is not as good as other extreme Eisbocks I have had, particularly Broken Keg Eisbock, from the old PP Carlsbad brewer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
2469,"2006-06-25",3.4,"Any first impressions?
-A ring of head decorates the glowing orange-pink.
-Wooden alcohol is ably blended into the subtle fruity caramel, forming a simple aroma.
-Honeyed cereals and obvious bock character are quietly conversing with toasted bread.
-The well-built malty body is surprisingly lean for such a big brew; a few love handles would not have hurt one bit.

What if you dig deeper?
-This is very Dogfish Head-like in its cleanliness, suave maltiness, and ability to hide alcohol.
-Feeble hop bitterness and fruity maltiness help each other in the finish, but fail to excite.
-For the same sipping purposes, a well-made ice cider is incredibly more satisfying to me.
-This is a fun high octane beer which has the amazing capacity to remain in the beer realm, but apart from that there is nothing in its flavor profile, body, or aroma which I find interesting.

Bottle #88; 2006 vintage.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2469,"2006-06-25",3.1,"7oz, bottle 88/100. Clear Rosé colour with quickly fading head. Rather burning alcohol nose does show some bock character underneath, certainly fruity (dried mango, peach and oranges) and with a bolder earthy, nutty kick. Spicy in its alcohol, slightly reminiscent of scotch through its sea air characteristics. Fully ripe grainy notes eventually remind of rice and concentrated cereals. I cant but relate it to a Sake from this point, it has the soft melon notes of the best sakes Ive had paired along with this warming feel, though it borders burning here. There are pleasant aspects, but the oily medium body at best doesnt speak of the richness this could hold. Furthermore, the malts are quite pale compared to the eisbocks Ive preferred and this directly leads to what appeared like missing parts in the shape of sweet chocolate/toffee/biscuit maltiness that would have added a desserty aspect, but as it is, its more like strong alcohol or sake than what I want from my beer. Sorry for not encouraging experiments here.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2469,"2006-04-23",5.0,"2006 bottle 76 of 100.  Very still appearance with a gorgeous burnished bronze colour.  Aroma of honeyed fruit, dried plums/prune, cherry, and peach.  Light pepper but not alcoholic smelling.  Sweet malty aroma, very vineous with notes of orange peel, dried white grapes and icewine.  Light noble hop spiciness comes through as well.  Port like.  Marzipan, pistachio, and baked Middle Eastern desserts.  Easily one of the most gorgeous smelling beers Ive ever had... that alone is worth the price of admission.  Its hard to believe that the flavour can match it, but it does.  Unctuous, silky mouthfeel.  Warming, but not overly hot. Honey and dried fruit, baked pastry, sweet nuts.  Long and luxurious finish.  After my first visit to Southampton, I was unimpressed, but a beer like this makes the memory of that visit disappear.  The sexiest beer Ive even tasted.

2469,"2005-12-07",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2005 12/7/05.  Poured out of 7 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with Eyedrinkale some time around the middle of this year.  Deep butter toffee caramel orange color with some very slight but still surprising carbonation.  Lacing and head retention are mostly non-issues, although the bits of tiny carbonation ribbons that do surface leave silken trails through the liquid that remind us it is indeed beer.  Aroma contains some McDonalds honey, lightly tangy with nibbles of alcohol pepper, somewhat oxidized and reminiscent of cane sugar.  Faint rubbing alcohol comes on in extremely deep inhalations-- maybe I shouldnt do that anymore.  Flavor rocks your face off.  Burning alcohol with some spiced presence, like a cinnamon cookie where they forgot to add sugar to the batter.  Softly, sweetly leathery with a freshly-shorn wet hay flavor (just like I used to eat all the time when I was a kid, right?) and an intensely concentrated, sophisticated cookie/biscuit/toast malt essence with a distinct German zeal to it.  Malt essence so extreme its almost in the realm of a scotch, but it leans away from peat and more toward golden raisins.  A seeming noble hop presence with the fresh hay mostly emerges toward the finish.  Not much sweetness in the flavor-- certainly not as sweet as the aroma suggests it might be.  The body and mouthfeel of this beer are just phenomenal-- dense and syrupy with a warming alcohol blanket that glides through the mouth and relaxes your throat and insides.  Finish is surprisingly a bit dry and reinforces the leather and hay with a powdery raisin residue.  Dryly sticky, rosiny on the lips.  A very classy, very impressive beverage.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Just the most spectacular glowing ruby-auburn with magenta and amber highlights.  Small, off-white/beige colored head is not extremely well-retained, but then, this is an 18% abv beer, so Im just impressed it pours a head at all.  Sediment is left on the bottom, and the beer is well unfiltered.  Aroma of dry tofee, walnut paste, sherry of course, sticky caramel, buttercream, plum brandy and rich barley.  Light hints of alcohol grace the nose, but its more a refined liquor sort of thing, not a raw ethanol.  Taking a sip, or should I say, sinking my teeth in to it, I am greeted with the most succulent of malts.  Thick, rich, caramel and toffee as far as the eye can see, with light raisins, vinous sherry notes and plenty of honey.  Finishes with a dry, musty yeast, like peanut or walnut skins.  Thick, chewy body is of course sweet, but not overly so.  Theres something so divine and well-done about the malt flavor that it makes drinking this a real treat.  Very low carbonation with a strong drying and yet warming sensation on the end.  Such a little, unpretentious bottle and such a magnificent king among beers. . .I cant even imagine how good this will be a number of years from now.2006 Vintage  Cracked this open Summer 08 to certainly less pleasure than the 04 vintage.  Really lacking in complexity and sheer maltiness that made the 2004 so delicious.  Some premature oxidation has set in, giving a rather dry, nutty, lightly crackery nose and finish.  Still not bad, despite some obvious alcoholic tendencies, but it wouldnt stand out in a blind tasting, Im sure of that.  7/4/7/3/15   Score is an average of the two Ive had.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

First of all, this makes me think liquor more than beer. Unlike 120 min and WWS, the only other two beers of this ABV Ive tried, this one barely resembles any particular style Ive had. Glowing ruby with a little forced head from my straight pour. Strong aroma of honey, caramel, and toffee. Flavors of nuts and honey on a strong alcohol backbone.

Moderate phenolic and salty snap as well to tickle the nose hairs. What a wonderful tasting brew with lots of fruit, honey, wildflower and woody notes on top of a major vinous and sherry quality.

2469,"2003-05-19",3.8,"2003, 7 oz. bottle #52 of 100 - considering the nature of this beer, the Samichlaus and WWS comparisons are unavoidable - this beer is better than them in some respect, but worse in others - it has low carbonation and zero head as one would expect from such a high alcohol beer - the aroma is full of cinnimon, maple, caramel, toffee, and a sinus destroying alcohol burn - these elements seem to come back in the flavor in various stages - it begins mildly sweet, slight toffee, then the alcohol swells up on the tongue, along with a cinnimon flavor that mixes with the alcohol well - after that there is a caramel and long lingering maltiness that comes in to remind you that you are drinking a bock - this is sweet, but not to a cloying extent like many beers with such high alcohol - the alcohol is heavy, but not overly astringent, making this very much like a dessert liquor - some brandyish elements are noticible - this did, however, come off as underdeveloped, but it was, of course, a very young bottle - I think with some aging and mellowing this could be great.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2469,"2003-04-02",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2003 2003 vintage.7oz bottle #73 of 100. This has got to be the thickest beer I have ever poured. Deep,fiery,oarnge/red, with no sign of carbonation.Although the alcohol in the aroma will singe nose,hairs,bock-like aromas still exist.Huge bready,toffee,vanilla,nuts,honeycomb,fruity-malt.S definitely taste the ""double"" in this Eisbock. Exreme,bready,tofeeish,nutty,fruity-malt flavors are cut with brandyish,alcohol. This beer is tweeked to the max!Finish starts bready and very sweet,but the alcohol lingers and burns,yummy. Although,alcohol is very evident throughout the whole experience,the beer still retains great,bock-like qualities and remains drinkable(when in mood).","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
2469,"2003-04-02",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2004 2003; 6.3 oz. bottle:  Glowing crystal clear rust.  Bottle conditioned.  Heavy emphasis on the cinnamon coated bready malt nuances and the nose buring alocholic flares.  Very meaty.  A manifold of underlying melon notes, fruitcake, honey, vanilla, pecan, maple, apple crisp, caramel, fig, mild metallic shades, and lightly toasted coconut.    Visciously thick, silky on the palate.  Minute carbonation. Initial acidity up front, followed by evergreen alcoholic flavors, like biting into a pine needle, cinnamon dipped malts coupled with intense blasts of spicy, puckering alcohol.  Finishes with apple skin and a touch of tropical fruit, lush caramel, salty mint leaf, and long fig notes.  Only a trace of hop presence.  I know its there, but with this being so young, its difficult to find. Only 100 of these produced?  A fallacy.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
