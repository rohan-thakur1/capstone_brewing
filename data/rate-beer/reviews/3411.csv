3411,"2016-12-29",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Mickeys 30th birthday bash on November 05. 375 mL bottle. The pour is a nice reddish-brown with a light tan head that falls slowly to a ring with a couple spots of soapy lace. The aroma is light sour citrus up front, a little bitter zest, and a light currant that blends with the cherry well. Its a real interesting combo, but it balances well. The flavor is very similar. There is a crisp fruitiness to it that just works and a citrus sour on the finish. There is a hint of bitterness and a light alcohol, but its really well balanced. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly sweet fruit and a hint of sour on the finish. Damn nice beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Going into this beer Im anxious to see the transformation of Cuvee de Tomme, one of my repeatedly favorite beer experiences of all time. Poured into a snifter, the beer boasts a hazy amber body with a nice reddish tint and white lacing. Aroma of sour cherries, funk, grapes and oak. The CdT character is present, but very subtle. Mouthfeel is almost like a champagne with notes of sour grapes, dark cherries, funk and a bizarre touch of grapefruit. Very interesting beer that turns out to be thinner bodied overall than the original CdT. The extra currants are evident with a huge grapy/wine profile to both the body and flavor.

3411,"2012-09-18",3.9,"Tasted from the bottle at Lost Abbey. Color was dark red and burgundy. Minimal head. Aromas of dark cherry were predominant without much funk. Flavors were similar to Cuvee but the currants added a bit of a twist overall. Mild bit of sour quality. Yep got to think of Consecration for sure. Pretty good beer and would prefer this to many past years of Cuvee.","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
3411,"2012-09-18",3.6,"Tastes like Red Poppy. Smells like Red Poppy with a bit of caramel. A bit Consecration-y. Sourness peaked at a 5. Not really noticing more brett. Alcohol masked well. One finger dirty peach head, fair retention. See my review of Red Poppy.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
3411,"2012-09-17",3.6,"Bottle at Lost Abbey.  Cloudy thick dark reddish pour, with an off white head.  Definite berry, currant, raisin, balsamic vinegar, tartness, bourbon, and a bit of earthy brett.  I thought the body was kind of strange ""chunky"" - heavy fruit filled suspension and the carbonation was course.  Decent, but not their best effort.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
3411,"2012-09-16",3.7,"Pours a hazy garnet color with an off-white head.  Currants come through on the aroma.  Mild balsamic and red wine vinegar aromas, plenty of oak, a bit of bourbon, and some vanilla.  Just a hint of alcohol.  The flavor has a good dark fruit flavor with plenty of currants and raisins.  Bourbon, vanilla, and lots of oak.  Vinegar sourness, a bit of alcohol, and a touch of leather.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
