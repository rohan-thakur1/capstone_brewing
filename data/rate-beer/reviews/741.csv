741,"2014-08-31",3.5,"Bomber from Total Wine in Huntington Beach, CA. Pours ruddy amber with a slight beige head. Smells like a malty amber. Not sure about hop. Maybe citrus. Med body or nearly. Typical chocolate start. Its bitter, but its a rye spice bitter. I like rye beers. But this one isnt working well for me. Maybe a hop that can control the rye would be good. Till now I couldnt conceive of too much rye. Persistence pays off. A little fruit is developing, and Im adjusting to the strong rye.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
741,"2014-08-06",4.0,"22oz bottle pours a reddy brown color with a bit of head. Mild hops balanced well against the great malty flavors. A very mild and yet flavorful beer.","California, USA","Bule"

741,"2013-08-24",4.2,"Poured at a good temperature with a massive, foamy, frothy, thick, slowly settling, cream-colored to light tan head and lots of lace. Color is a clear copper with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is an equal blend of malt and fresh hop. Flavors like nose, but much more complex - include a little roast, metallic, and medicine. Carbonic tang is very closely matched with hop bitter up front with the barest hint of sweet in the back. Body is good, ditto carbonation; although the bitterness is very close to clashing with the tang. Finish is like flavor; bitter is very long lived and twists into something not so pleasant. This brew is much better consumed without too much delay.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
741,"2013-08-23",4.1,"Toffee, toast, dark fruit, citrus aroma. Toasted/bread crust flavor; kind of sweet, and some raisin-y flavor. Centennial citrus hops. Maybe some really subtle roasted flavor (chocolate malt?).","Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","EdInSaltLake"
741,"2013-08-01",4.2,"My wife picked the rye out right away. I agree! Red and brown with a really nice foam. Lots of lacing. Aroma has caramel and toasted malt aromas, but a little tinny. Like the firm body, plenty of malt, and a fresh blend of rye spice. Finish has a good hop balance and more of that spice.","LAS VEGAS, Nevada, USA","kathouse"
741,"2013-07-04",3.0,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with a thin khaki head. Citrus hop notes on the nose. Has a bit of the rye on the tongue. The hops overpower them quite noticeably. Finishes clean. Not my favorite rye.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
741,"2013-06-07",3.6,"7 June 2013, bottle. Copper/red, clear, occasional bubbles. Nose is great! Maybe some rye malt, sugary bubble gum, resin notes, moderate alcohol. Thin body and mildly fizzy. Lots of resin, some faint sweet alcohol. Meh.

741,"2012-08-08",3.9,"22oz bomber pours rusty crusty ruby red supporting a tan head. The aroma offers up a mix of molasses and roasted malts as well as some spicy hops and a bit of dark German rye bread. The taste has pleasing notes of roasted malts, chocolate malts, some pine hop bitterness and then a decent rye like twang midway and into the finish.

741,"2011-11-23",3.3,"Draft at GABF. Pours a reddish amber, hazy with an offwhite head. The nose is quite spicy and grainy. Some citrus notes come through in the nose as well. On tasting, moderately bitter with some grainy astringency. Big spicy notes that are complimented by the hop character. Not really anything popping out of this one, but a well made beer overall. Decent.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
741,"2011-11-12",3.5,"Bomber thanks to here4beer. Pours a hazy deep amber with a small off-white head. Aroma is a soapy caramel and toffee, with some spicy rye.

Very nice and drinkable!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
741,"2011-11-12",2.5,"Bottle from atom.  Minimal haziness, but still prevalent, in the appearance to this beer.  Nice amber color with a just a hint of a white head.  The aroma is caramel.  Taste is caramel, spicy/faded hops, and slightly grassy, dry finish.  Possibly an old bottle, but still this just is not that good.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"

741,"2010-01-10",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Pours with a hazy amber body and lots of lacing left by the white head. Aroma of rye and bready notes, and light floral hops. Taste is quite bitter up front, spicy, sticky with some toffee. Wish they put more of the hops into dry hopping and later addition hops as this comes across as malt forward in profile with strong bitterness, but no real hop character (flavor or aroma wise...just bitter). Well attenuated, and well carbonated.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

741,"2009-08-06",3.9,"Smells hoppy for sure. In fact, I pretty much just got hops from this in flavor, so much so that I didnt hardly notice the rye as I do in other rye beers. A bit too heavy on the bittering hops but still quite good.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
