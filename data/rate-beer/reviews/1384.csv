1384,"2017-03-22",3.5,"tap @ tap & bottle: There seems to bit a little bit of confusion as to the style of the beer since both Untappd and the bar label it a Dunkelweizen instead of a Dunkel? This is understandable since its really on the edge combining the two styles. Nose has ample smoked clove, some banana but not as strong as many of the good German Dunkelweizen. Taste is as sweet as most Dunkel but also has enough body to be taken as a Weizen. Finish is refreshingly clean, lingering taste of clove, caramel, some roast. Overall quite a nice drinker although it reaches my maximum for sweetness tolerance for a 5.0% abv beer with otherwise medium body.","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","derA"

Not much to look at and the mouthfeel is thin, but the taste and aroma are nice.

Toasty grainy nose up front with a tinge of roasted malt, moderate amount of banana esters and light sweetness behind.

Bitterness peaked at a 3. I dont think this is strong, but I get a little alcohol. Tinge of cinnamon or some light spice, as well as some tang, as it warmed.

1384,"2012-07-31",3.4,"On tap at Pizza Port Ocean Beach; July 2012
The beer arrives from the tap with a pale brown tinged, full tan colored head that sits on top of a concentrated brown beer. The aroma smells nutty and of toasted grain husks. There are also some nice roasted coffee notes to the aroma; this last is quite prominent and really makes this beer quite interesting, at least a traditional German Dunkel usually does not smell like this.

Lightly sweet tasting, but still quite light bodied; this beer is eminently quaffable, yet still has quite a lot of flavor to it. There is a soft nutty note to this beer, some toasted / roasted grain husk character, as well as a light, city roast, sort of clean coffee roasted character to the flavor. There is a touch of cocoa to the dark malt flavors, but only just.

This is a solid Dunkel; the coffee note in the aroma is quite interesting and a bit different. Technically this is a touch too grain husk focused for a traditional Dunkel, but I am still finding myself enjoying this quite a bit.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1384,"2011-02-16",3.5,"A: The beer pours a chestnut sort of color with a big off-white head to go with it.

S: A fairly roast heavy dunkelweizen with a big emphasis on caramel and nutty toffee. There is a moderate amount of spice, such as clove, with a bit of banana and some dark fruit and molasses notes.

T: The banana sweetness is nice on the palate, but as the beer warms up, the roast, molasses, and nuttiness really start to come through. Toffee and caramel provide additional sweetness and theres a mild spice character.

M: The body is medium and the carbonation is on the higher end of medium.

D: Not as good as the hefeweizen, but a good German style beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

1384,"2006-02-20",3.7,"(Draft: Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA) One of the many new Jeff Bagby beers on tap at the Carlsbad location, this is not a ""knock you over the head"" dunkelweizen, but is more subtle, balanced and quite interesting.  Wheaty, yeasty, and a decent amount of banana, but its not so strong that it dominates the other flavors.  An unexpected, but pleasant smokiness comes out of nowhere toward the finish, and this remains on the palate for the rest of the session.  When I asked Jeff about the unusual smokiness, he wrinkled his nose and blamed the chocolate malt for that.  So apparently the smokiness was unintended, but I loved it.  Aromas of banana and bubblegum, with light smoked bacon at the back end of the sniff.  Medium-full bodied, but thinning a bit in the finish.  Soft but apparent carbonation.  The color is somewhere between a deep ruddy amber and light brown, and is fully cloudy.  Light tan head is small on the pour.  A very nice dunkelweizen that shows commendable restraint and balance, and the smokiness adds an interesting twist.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
