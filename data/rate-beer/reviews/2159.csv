2159,"2012-01-01",3.1,"On tap at the brewpub... Pours a completely transparent amber brown hue , homogenous throughout, and topped with a thin wispy soapy barely off-white head... Aroma of fruity pears  and banana yeasty esthers. Fairly subdued on the spice front actually and was expecting more in that regard... Dark and mild fruits throughout, generally sweet with caramels and soft grain that gives it some texture. A touch more than full in body with decent level of lively carbonation. Lacking some complexity and spice nature that usually is offered up by the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

2159,"2011-04-04",3.2,"Draft on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a glowing golden pour, light haze, small offwhite frothy head laces small, dies into a film. Aromas are light pine, touches of sweet toffee, caramel, bready malts. Some tea, light florals, some light grass. Initial is lighter bodied, touches of piney bitterness move into sweet bready malts, juniper berries, light bitterness, touches of honey and toffee, light bodied overall, easily quaffable. Quite clean, a backend that busts some ass with sweet honey, wet bread, and some piney juniper. Light overall, easily drinkable. The pine fades out a bit much for my liking, sweet rye and oats with a touch of toastiness. Bitter pine tries its best to balance, but cant. A sweeter beer, ok overall. Interesting.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2159,"2011-03-30",2.4,"In tap at GI into a tasting glass, recommendation by the bar tender...Pours a yellowish gold, pretty clear, watery lacing...The aroma is pretty good, a nice mixture of fruit and tea. Tea does dominate mostly but the pears and lemon help to balance this a little...The balance on the nose is undone the taste as its mostly tea with aloe and other herbal notes. Still some fruity notes just not enough.

To much tea for me to make it drinkable. What some would find refreshing I find as medicinal.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

2159,"2010-11-08",4.1,"Had this while in Chicago for the weekend.

Poured from the tap into a tasting glass.

The color is a clear gold with a slight head and little lacing.

The smell is fruity with a touch of plum and a slight tea like flavor. There is a bit of a malt flavor in the back with some spiciness as well.

The taste is again, fruity with pear, and some apple flavor that is smooth and mellow. There is a nice bready flavor that is a bit dry as well. 

The feel of this beer is light and goes down smooth. There is a bit of a dry feel to this beer that is an interesting feature but leave my mouth a little flat. This would go well with the properly paired food that might compliment this beer well.","Cumberland, Rhode Island, USA","Duhast500"

I caught the juiper first in the aroma, but it wasnt dominant.  There is also some biscuity malts and honey.  Flavor is a little sweeter with some earthy spicy juniper coming forth stronger in the finish, which was semi-dry.  Bitterness peaked at a 2.

Not strong enough to overpower and light enough to provoke some thought. Went well with the clam chowder, but after seeing the biscuits and gravy, I think it would go with all the fare here.

2159,"2009-04-25",3.5,"Sampled February 2009
A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip with a frothy, initially fat-one-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a murky, pale amber color that shows an opaque, bright, straw gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma is interesting, with an herbal, almost pine like character that must be juniper.  Other aromas of grassy grain, fresh crushed malt, perhaps a hint of soapiness and even a hint of light tartness in the finish.  An interesting, somewhat, hearty aroma.  I definitely like the mix of hearty grain aromatics, light spiciness and hint of tartness that is found in the aroma.

The taste is lightly malty up front, but then picks up a definite tartness that is lactic in character.  This lactic tartness makes this quite thirst quenching.  There is a touch of a woody note and astringency to the finish.  Grassy malt notes and some savory grain character are noticeable up front and a cracker-like grain note tends to linger on in the finish.  This beer is quite dry, but still has quite a bit of body to it; it has a certain viscous character to it and a palate fullness, neither of which keep this from being quite quaffable.  The juniper spicing is more subtle in the flavor than it is in the aroma (and it is fairly subtle there too), in the flavor it sort of adds a subtle spiciness that is just barely evocative of pine and some sort of berries.

My wife just tried some of this and reminded me that I have had this on tap at Goose Island Clyborne 6 to 7 or so years ago; the juniper character was more fresh then, and there wasnt any real tartness to that beer (if my memory isnt failing me).  Still I like the extra tartness in this beer, it is a nice, clean sourness and it goes well with the rest of the beers character.  Perhaps not the most complex of beers, but it is certainly tasty enough; this would definitely be a great hot weather beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2159,"2009-04-11",4.0,"Big thanks to StFun for hooking me up with a bottle of this, I thought it was a really long shot.  Poured a hazy pale orange-yellow color with a 1/2 inch thick white head that faded to a bubbly layer and left some spots of lacing.  Aroma of dry, rustic fruit (orange, light lemon peel, soft tangerine), some juniper,  a moderate spiciness (clove, pepper), and some soft vanilla.  Crisp, lightly tart entry with some hints of citrus (light lemon, tangerine) layered with subtle juniper berry spiciness and a light bitterness along with hints of rye that finishes dry with a moderate yeastiness and hints of cobweb and wood.  Moderate carbonation with a very nice balance between body and crispness.  I guess I dont get the low scores.  While it isnt exactly a traditional representation of the style, I still thought it was very good.  Thank you once again Josh.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"
2159,"2008-12-20",3.6,"Bottle from the 20th Anniversary series.  Pours a cloudy orange with a thin white head.  Interesting aroma, spicy, orange, a little wood, and some juniper.  It actually tastes pretty good.  The juniper actually gave it a little bit of sour flavor for me, which was good.  Interesting beer.  I enjoyed it.","","User29624"

2159,"2008-11-29",3.6,"Tone of thanks to StFun for this amazingly generous gift.  This was one of my most wanted beers to try for years.  Pours orange with a thin white hilm.  Smells of bananas, cloves, fresh juniper, vanilla.  Tastes of juniper, spruce, touches of vanilla and spice.  Grassy, earthy finish.  Good, but lacking the subtle hint of tartness I’ve grown accustomed to.  The best American example of sahti continues to be Shenandoah Millennium.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
2159,"2008-11-26",3.5,"Growler from Clybourn brewpub. Pours a dark, golden color with minimal white head. Aroma was of malt, lemon, yeast, spice, and rye. Taste was much of the same, with some very nice earthy flavors and a lot more honey. A very sweet start, with a dry malt and rye taste underneath.

2159,"2007-12-17",3.2,"Thanks to Mike for picking up a growler of this for me!  Goose Island Rating #100!  Poured a healthy shade of orangey-golden with a short-lived cap of white head and some rising carbonation.  The aroma was on the odd side (which it should be because I havent tried the style before) with spicy rye, berries and honey.. overall dark sweetness to it.. this was enjoyable, but the combination of sweetness made it almost vegetal.  The flavor had sweet honey and juniper berries at the core with tart lemon zest and peppery spices around the tongue and through the finish.. a bit warm at the finish with some grains and honey on a tacky finish.. interesting, but tasty.  Medium-bodied with a sryupy feel across the middle.. lower carbonation and spicy at the finish.. flowed decently.

2159,"2006-01-09",4.3,"Clybourn.  Translucent gold in color with a creamy white sliver of a disc for the head, which leaves lovely vellum lacing as we go.  Clean, fresh linen leads the aroma, confounded with spray starch, cotton blossoms, hard biscuit crust, lemons and coriander.  Flavor is one of a kind.  Freesia, lilacs, and grains of paradise compose an herbaceous and pollinated array.  Rye kernels frolic amidst budding blossoms.  This sahti is singing ""peaceful springtime ponds,"" and its hard to conjure up any memories of a time when I was so surprised and impressed by the herbal extremities and uniqueness of any single beer.  Only a small hint of juniper berries.  Inexcusably wonderful on the palate, as we tiptoe along the trail with soft floral pitter-patters, finishing with a chomp of pollinated April air.  Thus begins my love affair with Sahti.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
2159,"2006-01-04",2.9,"I dont know about this.  It had a weird spicy potpourri taste and aroma.  From first hit to the swallow this beer changes a lot.  Aforementioned flavors are present first then on the aftertaste its sweet and malty.  Not great.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
2159,"2006-01-04",3.0,"Served amber/orange with a thin white film. Aroma of ginger on top of alcohol with zesty spicing, and the juniper comes off as evergreen. As a whole, however, the concoction reeks of an oil-based paint. There was an alcohol tinge under an odd & enjoyable fruity/spiciness with pine notes and a buttery mouth. Interesting and warming but distracting.

It poured out a hazy yellow color with a ticklish, frizzy white head that vanished after making contact with my moustach.  The aroma was like an aerosol air cleaner, fresh, but with no soggy, overly-scented bubbles up the nostrils.  Piney, herbal, fruity, woody.

After my exciting trip to Finland and my quest for authentic Finnish sahtis, I was stoked to get a chance to taste an American version to compare whether it got the job done!  Answer: Not quite.  But you gotta give em props for trying, darnit.  Its fatal flaw is they didnt put enough juniper berries in it!  The smell is that of a pilsner.  The rye malt and oats lend some body and complexity.  Im told 2003 sahti is their mildest sahti in the several batches theyve been cooking up.  Time to take it up a notch guys!

The aroma hints of grains ( oats and rye), ripe and spicy fruit (pear and juniper berry), floral and grassy hops, musty yeast esters, and toasted malts. The taste starts very grainy, the rye componment is very domimate but so to is the malt and oats. An undertone of citric fruits (orange zest?), ripe fruits (pear and apple) and spice from the juniper berries provide a level of strange depth. It even taste floral and perfumy! What hops are detected are mostly upon the finish, which was short and crisp. The natural qualities of the traditional ales are very pleasant and the sublime nature makes me work hard but increases the enjoyment even more.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Once I got the beer below the lip of the tulip the aroma rose with light toasted grains, wet, sticky pale strawberry malt and floral hops.  Perfumey flavours are rounded out with bitter orange peels, sweet lemons and cool wet grass.  Interesting experience, but not much more.

2004 Draught: similar experience second time around: same colour and pour, right up to tulip lip.  This time I noticed more herbal qualities that I remember, with the rye malt taking a back seat.
