Początkowo dziwna metaliczność delikatnie dominuje aromat, bardzo szybko jednak ucieka i wpuszcza pomieszanie dobrego, młodego lambika i figowo-karmelowych nut beczki. Super!","Warsaw, POLAND","Korcz"

4106,"2016-04-13",3.5,"Bottle shared by martjoobolut, my first ever unblended Lambic - massive thanks! Style tick 76/77. Real nice funky, farmhousy, apple cidery aroma and flavour. Sour with apple skin bitterness. Its woody dry but not too barrely, in fact, I dont get much sherry in this. Could very well be because I dont think Ive ever had Amontillado. Crisp carbonation. Seems rather simple - not too much going on, but still very nice.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"

4106,"2015-11-28",3.6,"Bottle (375 ml) at home. Split 2-ways with Minderbinder. Slightly hazy bright amber with a small bubbly white head leaving little lacing. Aroma is pretty interesting at first and probably could be confused with a real unblended lambic. Its oaky and earthy with a mild funk but also some oxidation and carboard notes. Taste is moderately sweet and moderately sour with oak, earthy notes, tobacco, oxidation and mild funk. Medium body. Soft carbonation. Mineral finish. Pretty close to the real thing and also quite tasty.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
