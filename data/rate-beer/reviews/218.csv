This is the best Kölsch Ive had outside of Köln. Bready, fruity and still crisp. Finishes clean. So easy to drink. And I would year-round, if Ben would make it part of his regular line-up. A sunny taste of summer in the dreary winter. Great from the can as well as on draft at the pub.","Portland, Oregon, USA","botanu"
218,"2016-10-02",3.2,"Can: &nbsp Clean but not as crisp as others. &nbsp A bit wheaty in fact. &nbsp Pale straw, very faint haze, sudsy head, little lacing. &nbsp Clean finish. &nbsp Good beer, just not as crisp as others, plus maybe a bit more wheaty and less grassy. &nbsp Decent.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

218,"2015-09-29",3.2,"Canned from LifeSource. Hazy light golden/straw in color with a pretty sizable white head. Some sediment as well. Dry grainy nose with a hint of grassy hops. Sweet grains up front with a bit of grass. A touch of soap as well. Pretty good overall.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
218,"2015-06-16",3.3,"16 oz single can from Mollys Spirits. Gold and clear appearance with a white head. Aroma of pale malts (crackers, biscuits), citrus fruits, light floral notes and a light peppery spice. Similar flavor, adding some toasted grain and light tropical notes. Crisp, clean and easy to drink with a light bitter finish. Light body with ample carbonation. A good chugger. Nice kölsch overall.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
218,"2015-01-24",2.7,"Can. Lightly hazed gold with a short white head. Starchy pale malt and fruity esters / apricot, hops are grassy and vegetal. Some dirtiness manifesting as concrete mix and calcium. Medium body, mild-flavored, medium sweetness with matched bitterness and noticeable acidity. Empty flavor profile is saccharine pale malt, gelatinous and turning to a watery, grassy, bitter and sour finish.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
218,"2015-01-21",4.0,"Can from The Liquor Collection Honolulu 210115. This is what a kolsch should be. Great beer with a solid amber colour, easy to drink, fresh in the mouth and super tasty.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"

Another solid entry from Breakside. For a Kölsch, this is surprisingly balanced, clean, and exceptionally quaffable. No off notes whatsoever, just crackery malt and attractive floral hops with a light tropical fruit character in the background. Very slammable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
218,"2014-12-18",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2015 Can 12/18/14
Pours light, light yellow with a fluffy white head. Cereals and bread dough, hints of pear and white grape in the aroma. Straight forward Kolsch flavors without the extra hop snap that too many PacNW brewers like to add to the style. Tasty stuff. Worth a revisit! 

Revist, can 11/6/15
So, the promised revised. Huge fluffy egg white head, hard to get enough liquid into the glass no matter how carefully I pour. This can isnt in the best of shape -- I confess I bought it this past summer and forgot it in the garage -- but its not too bad and my impressions are very consistent. In addition to the cereals, its surprisingly fruity, almost cider-like, I thought before seeing the earlier ""pear"" entry. Nice beer. The 3.7 seems a bit generous; Id call this 3.5 or maybe 3.6, but since it isnt really fresh Ill let the original stand.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
218,"2014-12-11",3.9,"The first keg we bought for my birthday kegerator and Im really pleased with it. Very pale with a slightly metallic malt aroma; this beer is all about the flavour and mouthfeel. Dense and creamy with heavy, relaxed cereals and a peppery, dry bitterness to break it up.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
218,"2014-11-21",3.6,"Can - I was a little afraid of trying this after a bad experience with their pils last night (it was a diacetyl bomb) - thankfully, this is much better - lightly hazy gold - aroma of honey, grass, light tartness/acidity - frothy texture - clean, medium sweet malt profile up front - dries out through the middle and finish, adding a lightly prickly acidity and a fairly assertive bitterness for the style, but still within what you might expect - grassy hop flavor and a slight crisp spiciness to the finish - solid.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
218,"2014-10-05",3.2,"Draught at Alibi Room, VancouverHazy pale blond color with compact head. It has a delicate crispy malt aroma; dry mouthfeel with some malt flavor; missing a bit of cracker malt, and some grassy noble hop; traces of yeast in the final.Quite true Kölsch.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

218,"2014-09-17",3.2,"Can. Pours a clear golden color with a moderate off-white head on there. Nose has a lot of corn in there, as well as just a bit of bitterness. Taste is sweet and slightly floral, with just a bit of some grains to it. Not bad, actually.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
218,"2014-09-09",3.6,"Painfully easy to quaff with some really nice things going on. Vigorous pour gives it a nice head and lingering, intricate lace. Malt side is grainy (cereal), slightly sweet (milk, honey) and somewhat hay-like. Hops are kind of citrusy and grassy, with a mild spiciness in the background. Good balance. Very pleasant beer.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
218,"2014-08-31",3.6,"On tap at St. Augustines, pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma and flavour of dry cereals, crisp grassiness, and a nice bite on the finish. Extremely well-brewed, quite authentic though a little hoppier. Could knock back gallons of this.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
218,"2014-08-28",3.4,"16 oz can pour. Pours super light with a sweet, grassy, grain aroma. Sweet bread flavor. Really really light beer here, and drinks super easy. A nice refreshing summer beer sums it up well. Light on flavor but has enough. Decent beer here. Better than a lot of others in this style. I enjoyed it.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

218,"2014-08-03",3.5,"Picked up a 22 oz can from The Bier Stein. Even the dude scanning the beer said the can was cool. Pours, you know, clear urine-colored with a white head, cuz thats what its supposed to look like. Basically the definition of a Kolsch. Light, subtle fruitiness, clean, and dry. Damn fine brew.","Colorado, USA","That1Guy"
