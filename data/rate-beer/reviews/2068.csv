2068,"2008-10-08",3.8,"In short: A very very very yeasty beer with a nice farmhouse character.  Very nice.
How: Bottle 750ml, consumed when about 6 months old.  Graciously sent my by after4ever, thanks a lot Tom!
The look: Golden blonde body with a enormous amount of yeast particles topped by a large off-white head.
In long: Nose is very countryside, borderline funky, with notes of overripe fruits.  What a chewy and fluffy body this one have, one of the most yeasty beer Ive had.  Soft bready malts or bready yeast, I dont know but it was very bready.  Very doughy.  Citrus fruits, red apples, ripe bananas, barely any sweetness.  A light herbal spiciness.  An overall impression of a big wet grandma fruity muffin from the farmhouse.  Finish is rather dry.  Superb beer for the yeast lover.  Sounds so much better than Superb beer for the bacteria lover.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Seems a bit citric. Medium plus body with frothy, creamy carbonation. Flavor is quite spicy in a noble hop way, with a little fruit, and a light amount of pale malt. Very refreshing. Turns a bit maltier in the finish. I could drink this constantly. I could imagine this is what Westvleteren blonde would be like. Until I get lucky, I can only imagine. Finish has a hint of orange.

The palate is very refreshing, cleansing, and quenching.  This is solid and under-rated.  There is no note of the 7% abv.  I think my new favorite style is either Bière de Garde or Saison.

2068,"2007-07-27",4.2,"Luminous gold. Thick, cakey froth deposits an abundance of intricate lace all over the lace. Dough, fresh straw, grassy hops and candy apples fill the nose as peppery esters tease the senses. Natural carbonation caresses the palate with a pillowy softness. Initially tangy and uplifting yet starchy, sweet, and doughy with a vibrant straw and fresh-bread malt frame. Hop character boasts ultra refined flavors reminiscent of honeysuckle and grass, as well as a clean and assertive bitterness which evokes thoughts of black pepper and aniseed. Minerally grit coarsens the otherwise voluptuously soft body. Elegant malts are squeaky clean and sport a vivid yet delicate honey-glazed sweetness. Yeast leaves its mark with a musty and plastery quality. Finishes with a scratchy bitterness which complements the minerals and accentuates the soft, honeyish malts which linger. An extravagant yet rustic ale thats undoubtedly overlooked/underappreciated because of its  subtleness.

Comments: Another extremely yeasty beer from Theillier. If its as variable as the regular Bavaisienne, this rating wont be worth much, but I did find it an enjoyable, sweet pale farmy ale with characteristic musty and almost earthy, salty notes.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2068,"2007-03-28",3.6,"A thick layer of creamy white mousse atop a copper orange brew that seemed to have way too much little yeast follicles, it almost looked like Metamucil.

Mandarin oranges, peaches and lychee, with a fresh, pepermint finish.

2068,"2007-03-27",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
A unique union of spicy yeast rusticity, herbal hoppiness, and honeyed malt sweetness creates a soothing farmhouse effect. Nothing less would have been expected of Theillier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A fleeting frothy foam frolicks atop millions of yeast particles; the honeyed gold gown is surely less sparkling than it could be.
-The yeastiness could get overbearing if one went for the 750ml by himself.
-Cork emanations thankfully evaporated after letting the glass breathe.
-The minty, leafy spiciness tickles my curiosity.

2068,"2006-11-13",3.7,"Hazy auburn with loads of floating particles and a tight, tiny bubbled white head.  This has a lovely nose full of sweet malt, light hoppy perfume, mild spice and a hint of warm alcohol.  Toasted grains, orange juice, a malting room floor, light licorice, grains of paradise, orange and grapefruit zest, sticky pine and a hint of toffee.  The body is silky smooth, but with plenty of heft and bright, lively carbonation.  Its fairly sweet up front, especially considering the other La Bavaisienne.  The sweetness gives way to a flavorful hop flavor, full of citrus fruit and pine, more grains and a light bit of warm alcohol.  Its a pretty tasty beer, but not as enjoyable as the original.  The malt is sweeter and not quite as dry as La Bavaisienne.  The increased hop presence is a nice twist, but I think Id rather have a drier version with a more robust and developed malt profile.  Maybe its another example of wishful thinking, but I was hoping for something a little better.  Either way, its still good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
2068,"2006-11-07",4.1,"2006 bottle consumed on 9/30/06Staunchly sturdy white/off-white head sits atop a light-goldenrod body, with some slight beige and light-copper tinges.  Tiny bubbles course upwards in the minimally hazy (leaving plenty sediment behind) liquid, supporting the fully lasting head.  Lacing proceeds down the glass in sheets.  Cant ask for much more in appearance.Snappy phenols bound upwards from the yeast, as honey-filled pils malt joins the game.  A strong shot of grassy, herbal hops dries things out, with white and black pepper lingering on the finish.  The yeast is delightfully unique and characterful, just what I remember from the amber version.  It almost defines a biere de garde, giving it that soft, yet distinct mineral character, light almond nuttiness and acidity and an almost cellar-like/musty band-aid character (borderline band-aid).  With the minty, lively, assertive hops, its quite a complete picture in the nose, sporting a high strength of aroma to-boot.  Neither alcohol nor any pils malt brewing flaws (DMS, vanillin, corn-like notes) are present.Succulent honey notes, dripped over fresh, gooey baguette are quickly matched by freshly picked herbal notes coming from the hops.  Dill and mint, oregano and parsley, whatever you want to call it, its dripping with flavor (and a moderate amount of bitterness) and certainly amped up from many of its contemporaries.  Belying the malt strength (in the realm of a double pils), is the tight, invigorating carbonation that breaks up any palate fatigue (certainly aided by the hops) and delivers an engaging experience to the last drop.  The extraction is wonderfully done and the yeast shines strongly on the finish, with notes of almonds, buttercream, strong, slightly bland minerals and plasticy band-aids that I find in the amber Bavai.  No alcohol in flavor, maybe a slight, slight hint of butter.Taken as a blonde belgian ale, or a strong pils, it most certainly comes off too sweet, though taken as a unique creation, in the modern, hoppy, quasi-Biere de Garde sense, it delivers a refreshing charm and uniqueness, or so I think.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Easy to drink, very light sweet grains and sugars very mellow.  Some light bread notes and a late floral note, a very delicate flavor.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
2068,"2006-10-02",4.1,"Bottle via The_Epeeist.  Shared at GABF 2006 post-party.  The beer pours to a clean chestnut body with an extremely fluffy white head.  Excellent lacing.  The aroma is nice.  Grain silo, light tartness, crisp, clean.  Nice clean yeastiness.  The flavor is crisp, clean cereal, and grapes with refreshing yeasts.  Clean and delicate.  I enjoyed this one quite a bit.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
2068,"2006-09-21",4.1,"9/21/06.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, purchased at Red Carpet Wine in Glendale, CA 9/14/06.  Lightly hazy glowing gold with a gigantic, fluffy and soapy white head, transforming from a dense froth to a rocky, mountainous pillow but lasting impressively long.  Theres a doily lace left behind as the head calms to a ""normal"" height, and a present-if-spotty lace left behind with each tilt of the glass.  The head fades to a dollop after several minutes, and the lacing actually improves.  Aroma is softly sweet and doughy, prominently yeasty with almost a pale nougat and golden taffy-like spectre of sweetness.  It almost smells like a sweet pilsner (but not an adjuncty mess), suggesting noble hops and straw-like bitterness to round out the farmhouse character.  Lightly acidic with a bold outline of lemon-cookie yeastiness.  Even some touches of cinnamon that I thought I figured in there.  The finish is medium-dry and slightly grassy, suggestive of unsweetened sugar cookies with traces of pepper and white smoke.  The hop presence is strongly intact on the level of some double IPAs Ive had, but theres not an oily, citrusy or piney hint in the least.  Just those lovely noble straw, grass, hay, and pepper notes.  Again very pilsner-like, but sweeter and bigger, badder.  Fluffy, frothy carbonation and slick-but-tangy (yeasty tingles) medium body that makes your mouth water just as the grassy hops and almost absorptively dry finish swath the tongue.  Still seems a little underattenuated (if I may be so bold) with touches of sweetness that arent troubling so much as they are gently disappointing.  Light and airy with an immense drinkability and refreshingness that belies its alcohol content.  A great beer, and still not quite on the level of the ""brown.""  If one of the locals around here offered something like this (and the only ones I could even see trying it are Pizza Port and Craftsman), Id be dishing that out to all believers.  Recommended to those same believers who previously enjoyed their bottles of Russian River Redemption.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
2068,"2006-09-17",3.2,"Near copper colour with very good & dense collapsing head, leaving lace. Fresh malts, as on the brewery attic, and after that, quite some dry hops. Caramelly taste, with a bit of kettle-caramelisation (hesitating to say Maillard seen the colour). Caramel stays on, going into a bit greenery finish, but always quite sweet. I seem to get some faint oxydation. Sticky, medium bodied. A bit disappointing. Rather sweet, with not a lot going on.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2068,"2006-08-30",3.0,"I believe I have a lot to say about this beer or more like I have a lot of relevant information surrounded around this beer.  Ill start with my disbelief in how my opinions can differ with some fellow RBers that I respect.  You know when one reads just random RBers reviews and disagree with it, its easy to reason it.  For example, this can be a crazy shut in.  However, when its people you have met and respect it becomes weird.  Its not just with this beer but just with other RBers I know and other beers.   So, I bought this at Shoreline Bev, on my first visit now that I officially live in LI.  Cost 6 bucks which is why I went for it b/c I have seen it as high as $11.  Fridged it for a day and opened it up with dinner.   Poured it into my Tripel Karmeliet large tulip glass.  So my expectations were high.  Pours copper with a thick frothy head.  The aroma is definitely pils malt and herbal and grassy as some of my fav reviewers have said.  But at the end, you know what it smells like... like a bad BdG mixed with a Heiniken or a Becks.  Thats that pils, grassy, herbal aroma.  There is some of that malty farmhouse character but weak. Taste is the same.  It does have a slightly sweet aftertaste.  Average mouthfeel and a bit of bitterness.  Just to finish off with this: I really hated French beer untiI I had the regular La Bavaisienne.  I was really excited for this one after that, especially after seeing some of the reviews.  However, I am back on my French beer boycott.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2068,"2006-08-17",4.0,"Pours a very foamy high carbonation hazy blond with a massive lasitng white head.  Aroma is very herbal, spicy hops, bready malts light spice, and very similar to the Thiriez Blonde.  Flavor is full with bready pils malts, very herbal and hoppy and finihses fairly bitter.  Nice overall.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2068,"2006-07-10",3.6,"750 ml bottle.
A three-dimensional head that resembles beaten egg-whites, tops this spritzy, clear, golden yellow brew.
Some tartness in the aroma, faint spice, Belgian funky aspect.
Very lightly delivered on the tongue, the flavor is slightly tart and earthy. I would have called this a Saison, but I am far from experienced in the two styles. II suspect there are some overlapping characteristics of the two styles. An enjoyable farmhouse style ale in any case.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
2068,"2006-07-09",3.8,"Sparkling yellow, nice sized white head. Winey, bready aroma, with some notes of citrus. The flavor is rustic, even a little gamey, with some mellow grainy notes. Maybe sourdough? Some herbal notes in the finish. Thanks to Springslicker for sharing this!","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
2068,"2006-07-02",3.4,"Clear golden pour - the aroma and flavor are very herbal and floral, with an almost pilsner-like light hoppiness and grassy character - buttery and spicy - refreshing, but a little thin.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
2068,"2006-07-02",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2006 My first thought is that this just has way to many bubbles  -  too much carbonation for me, takes away from the enjoyment of these beers.  Luckily for me, the big head is no reflection of the actual mouthfeel, as its pretty smooth and creamy overall.  This is a very mild biere de garde, with very few spices.  Very herbal, lagered and slightly yeasty/sour.  Some mild fruits, only slightly malty.  Very decent beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
2068,"2006-07-02",4.5,"Golden with copper highlights, decent foamstand but not overly lacey;Hints of orange rind and cedar in the aroma, a little hardwood foresty too...plus GARRIGUE! Well, maybe...nice flavor, malty yet with a powdery (as in talcum), medicinal note, probably the house yeast and possible french hops like striessel spalt or something. A complex yet ultimately simple to enjoy beer, great new effort from this venerable and AMAZING  brewery","Portland, Oregon, USA","Perkeo"
