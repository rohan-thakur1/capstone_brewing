Always an enjoyable beer and though its a bit bigger than Fort Point, its one of my favorite of the street series, despite not loving Galaxy hops. Theyre done with much less tang/punch than in many other Galaxy IPAs and the lush fruitiness really shines. Even though its a notch bigger than fort point, abv-wise, its still quite drinkable, with a perfect texture and tight carbonation. Great attenuation, as their IPAs/pales always have and a lovely soupy appearance but yet with a full, well-retained white head.

3855,"2015-03-04",4.2,"The beer is a pale tan yellow color. The head is white and voluminous. Lots of lacing and whatnot. The aroma is full of fruity hop flavor. Big pineapple and tangerine. Lime, orange peel, mango. Light yeasty note. Maybe a little fresh pale malt character but its way in the background. Taste is hoppy with essentially no initial bitterness. The finish is yeasty and dry with lingering moderate bitterness. Very flavorful. Fresh and bright hoppiness. Easy to drink. Soft, full mouthfeel. Another tasty, tasty hoppy beer from Trillium.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3855,"2015-03-01",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2015 Fresh bottle from trade. BIG thanks! Pours murky yellow golden with a one finger fluffyish white head. Looks a little flat on the pour. Aroma of pineapple juice, oranges, lots of tropical citrus here. Flavor is very sweet pineapple juice and orange zest, lightly bitter, twinge of lemongrass. Mouthfeel is fuller and smooth, but this is way on the flat side with nearly no carbonation. Everything is there flavor wise, but this really seems like it might be a bad batch or bottling given the low carbonation, and that really takes away from what seems to otherwise be a delicious treat. Hope to try it again and up the score, though its good as is.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

Very little bitterness to be had at all, this really shows off hop flavors rather than fighting out the bitterness war.

The flavor is much the same as the nose with fresh juicy citrus turning into a lightly pine and grassy dry bitterness. Bitterness lingers for a good bit after the sip. It is a little abrasive toward the finish but that is what I like about it. Cant wait to try the Heavy Mettle I have a bottle of!

3855,"2014-06-17",3.3,"From bottle. Pour is extremely murky, dark golden amber, tight white head. Nose hits you from a distance with a big hop punch. Nose is a bit messy, lots of sugars and malt that arent really tight but a huge citrus punch blasts the nose. Taste is the same, malt is very sporadic and unrefined, doesnt get too sweet but you can tell this is big. Hops really drown out any other flavor, full citrus blast with a hint of tea and a fairly light bitterness for the hop punch. Well carbonated and semi dry finish.
