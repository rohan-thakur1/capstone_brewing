Aroma of sour peach candy, tart apricot, sour acidic bite, a bit of lambic-y apple, lighter funk, oak, hay.

4451,"2017-02-19",4.1,"37.5cl bottle, partagée avec la BXL tasting crew, merci Pierre T. assemblée juillet 12 , 2016.
Dorée sur un léger voile, col blanc fin.
Arôme au nez marqué de pêche fermentée, abricot arrive plus en retrait mais qui regagne en puissance une fois que la bière est décantée depuis 15 bonnes minutes. Le rétro reste funk, avec de fins assemblages.
Palais est finement acidulé qui semble être un peu opposée par la douceur des fruits. Abricot ressort plus sur ce coup ci avec un picotement et fine note épicée qui perdure tout le long. Le tout est légèrement râpeux et grinçant aux dents. Funk persiste à tous les niveaux de la dégustation avec une légère sécheresse du boisé. Retrouve une base de moût, lambic en impression et grains.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

4451,"2016-12-31",3.7,"(375ml bottle) clear gold, no head and a little tepid. Nose of juicy and dried apricot, fruit forward, covers most of the gueuze base for me.

The aroma is blueberries, cinnamon, orange pulp, greek yogurt, and cranberries. Sweet and fruit, and very tart. Medium body, with a fizzy, creamy, silky, and luxurious mouthfeel. This is a lovely, fruity, and well made beer. Simple at first, but this develops quickly into a complex, layered beer.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
