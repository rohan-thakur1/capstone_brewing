1894,"2017-01-15",3.3,"Visual: Pours clear copper brown with a smallish 1cm head, a spotty 1mm layer of retention, clusters of very active streams, sticky lacing.

Nose: toffee malt with light citrus hops (lvl-6)-pungency

Attack: soft smooth & crisp

Mid-palate: peach-citrus hop oils, (lvl-3-sweetness), dry metallic, grainy toffee barley malt

Finish: lengthy hopped soft dry bitterness

Summary: Pretty decent, good a good balance of hop and barley grain profile. A tad too metallic for my tastes and the hops are on the dull side.","","sulawang"
1894,"2016-12-05",3.7,"Bottle in Seattle. Thanks Andrew. Soapy white head, mine poured yeasty (but Andrews poured clear copper-amber). Coppery, bitter malt. Pretty tasty. Mineral undertones. Lots of stone bittering. Body is much sharper and more bitter than Id expected. Nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
1894,"2016-08-15",3.7,"330 mL bottle poured, courtesy of mcberko. Thanks! Remembering one of the best beers from my Vancouver trip being a Four Winds, this is a fun try. Pours an oily copper color with a thin fizz head. Clean malt fronted flavor, with a near perfect balance of hops. Caramel hints, and a subtle bitterness. Creamy body. Good addition to the style here. Very nice","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

Pine cones salivating rich resin. Lonely mountain firs suddenly fructiferous and bearing all manner of grapefruit, velvet pineapple and drunk, wraith-like flowers puffing pollen. Pepper pixies sprinkle crushed bones of their delicately extinct ancestors. A roughness later emerges, a puzzle of pulverised stones and excavation equipment.

The echo of an obliterating bitterness passes through my sinuses while sweet dreams of soft, sticky beatitudes coat the back of my palate. Blessed, sweetened grains and pitted fruits then shrivel into a brief medicinal twang.

1894,"2016-02-23",3.8,"Appearance: slightly hazy pale amber with one finger of rocky off-white head, excellent retention and lacing. (5/5) Aroma: bright citrus, stone fruit, pale malt, Resiny pine.

The first whiff of the aroma reminded me of nothing so much as lemon Pledge. Not that it shot a solvent edge - it doesnt, not really - but the citrus is surprisingly bright. Hoppy, but well-balanced with pale malt. A quite enjoyable Pale. (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

1894,"2014-04-29",4.0,"Deep gold white head. Very floral hops, biscuity malt, not much caramel or citrus in this batch, very clean, not phenolic in the bottle. Recently some English blokes on this site have been complaining about session IPAs being the same as hop-forward golden ales... this is the style theyre talking about. I had a number in my days before joining this site, and this is the first locally brewed beer Ive had that fits that style. Good quality, too. Very glad to see it over here now. Will definitely buy more, doesnt deserve to be flying under the radar, this is a very distinct beer here in the PNW.Im impressed!","Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA","WheatKing"
