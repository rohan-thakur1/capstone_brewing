Sweet and malty in taste with brown sugar, toffee and caramel flavours all blending together well. There is some nice fruity notes at the tail end of the drink as well.

Medium to full bodied and mild carbonation with this beer. It has a quite creamy texture to it and a warm, bittersweet finish.

A rather nice, well balanced beer that goes down quite well that has a nice bittersweet finish to it. It is quite malty and as such probably not a beer that Ill have all that often but certainly one that I did enjoy.

4357,"2010-06-30",3.5,"Bottle. Pours with a finger of eggshell foam that dissipates down to about a centimeter but sticks around after that. Rich coppery brown color that is fairly opaque; has rising carbonation bubbles up the side of the glass. 

Ripe red grape aromas (nowhere near tart) and not all that sweet, which is interesting for the style. Some mineral and a bit of a hop kiss; very bready and hints of some sweeter maltiness. 

Very much into the red grapes and the fresh fruit tartness of that flavor sneaks in a bit; moves onto the maltiness associated with the style; bready and very nutty; almost a savory finish. Interesting departure from some of the sweetness associated with the more malt-centric takes on the style. Bit dry even though it has a fairly substantial body. 

Dont think that this is quite the quaffer as some others in the range, and it weighs in pretty well in the abv department. Nice, and a little dry helped things along. Not as warming as others, but still enjoyable.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"

4357,"2009-02-22",4.1,"16oz bottle. Pours a crystal clear mahogany with a big  long lasting beige head. Thick and leaves ample lacing. Beautiful beer! Nose is equally impressive. Sweet caramel, an amazing banana bread aroma, hazelnut and raisin. Some molasses comes through as well.   Taste wise it doesnt quite live up to the amazing aroma and apperance but its still quite tasty. Carbonation is a little to prickly and the complexity isnt as refined as the Belhaven Wee Heavy. There is however a great lingering finish of toffee and caramel and a nice heavy mouthfeel. Some raisins come to play at the beginning but its fleeting. The middle part of the palate is dominated by sweet bready malt and yeast and a slight hop tick at the end. Probably one of the better traditional wee heavys out there. This is slightly smokey as well but that doesnt really come in to play until the beer warms to near room temperature. Still a welcome addition to the flavor profile. This is one everyone should try because its so undeniably Scottish and also so beautifully crafted. Very very nice.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"

4357,"2008-05-21",4.3,"Old Jock. I think this is why I didnt used to like most ales. I used to buy this fairly regularly and it was wonderful, I loved the hell out of it; and then I would drink another ale and it would pale in comparison. It was pathetic really, the other red ales; especially a few days or weeks after Id had an Old Jock. It was such a great ale.

Then I stopped buying it for almost a year. I bought one the other day becase I figured I should rate it now that Im rating things on here, and wondered how it would compare now that I have started to enjoy more and more ales.

I poured it about two minutes ago, a dark amber color. The head was thin but present; clinging to the glass. 

The bottles sweet too, makes me think about being a kick ass guy with a big beard and shit. Hes got a nice thick mustache, the kind I keep trying to grow... I mean I have a sweet civil war mustache and all, its really pretty badass; but this guys stache/beard combination blows mine away. Just like it continues to blow away all the other ales.

I remember now why I bought this regularly.

The smell is hard to pick out, barely present hints of caramels and malts.

The taste is a beautiful cacaphony of caramels and malts and flavor. It stikes me as what an ale should taste like. The best ale Ive ever had.

Thick and heavy in the mouth, a little creamy from all the caramels. There is a presant but not overwhelming level of carbonation.

I should buy it more, in fact I will buy it more. I wish I had bought more as Id like to crack another one open.

Wonderful orangy-brown, light creamy thin head. Huge sweet malty aroma, almost like fruit-loaf. Enormous, malty taste, starts mid-roasted, and then later a darkly burnt roast comes to the fore.

This one was slightly sweet, soft chocolate and caramel.  Finishes with a nice caramel maltness.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
4357,"2002-12-23",2.9,"Description is right-on, slightly sweet with a hint of licorice.  I cant say this tops their Merlin Ale but this is good in its own sense.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","labattblueleaf"
4357,"2002-12-20",3.7,"Pours to a slighty frothy head which quickly dissipates.  Great dark amber/orange color and clarity.  Hint of plum? in the aroma.  Definate taste of licorice in the mouth along with some sweetness of caramel.  Little weak on flavor though.  Light end, medium bodied ale which goes down smooth with a slight warm of alcohol.  A decent beer in a great bottle.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"
4357,"2002-12-01",3.6,"Peachy and appricot aroma with a light touch of alcohol.  Copper color with a head that get thin very fast.  Nice fruity taste that does not seem to go in any one direction other than light friut.  Finish is on the sharp side.  Good but not great, It could use to be a litlle more flavorful.","Southampton, Pennsylvania, USA","amx1970390"
4357,"2002-11-26",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2003 delicious sweet-malt-hop flavor (that is to say, well balanced - there are many flavors mingling here) beautiful color! It's a pitty that I was only given 2 bottles of this. must try some more.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
4357,"2002-11-19",3.5,"Nice scottish ale aroma, a bit like Gruyere cheese.  Coppery-amber color, little or no apparent head.  Nice bittersweet flavor.  I still prefer Orkney Skullsplitter, but this is still quite good.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","FastEddie"

4357,"2002-10-27",3.7,"Cloudy brown color, Dissipating head with lots of lace. Aroma reminds me more of a Belgian dubbel than a Scottish. Flavour is along the same lines, fruity/malty, but not as sweet as most Belgians, and therefore more to my liking.","Houma, Louisiana, USA","Skred"
4357,"2002-10-22",3.5,"Deep red almost black color. No head to speak of. Smells like mollasses and fruit. Starts sweet with an a mild anise flavor. Finish figs/dates that lasts.

4357,"2002-10-15",2.8,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2004 Started in 1979 by David Younger of McEwan and Younger, Broughton changed hands in 1995 and has managed (somehow) to gain a reputation for decent beers. This Scottish Ale has more in common with an English Old Ale: a good strength used to add depth, and lots of complex chopped fruit embedded in a malt jelly base. Initially pleasing it soon becomes apparant that this is a beer flexing its over-inflated muscles into a parody of a sugar coated muscle builder. The result is an Arnold Schwarzenegger fruit cake dipped in rum and Fairy Liquid. Unbalanced and crude - there are better Old Ales (or English Strong Ales) around. Try Theakston Old Peculier for example, or - if you can find it - Stonehenge's Old Smokey. [2.8]   And again...  White Cliffs Winter Ales Fest. Gravity.  Sweet. Acidic. Not brilliant. [2.8]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
4357,"2002-10-01",4.3,"Ahhh, a terrific ale, though it doesnt taste all that Scottish.  Its right up there with Faygate Dragon on my list of enjoyable ales.  Note to drinkers: this ones kind of sweet and is fairly malty.  You may note a small bite of alcohol if you search for it.  Great stuff.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
4357,"2002-09-16",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2005 Rerate Aroma not as prominent, flavor not quie as sweet and chewy - still decent though. Original 4 Like a fruit salad in a glass.  Wished I would have had some meat and cheese like the bottle recommends.  Heavy molasses aroma - thick pour with particles lasting throughout.  Weak head.  Full - bodied fruity malty flavor. Strong finish.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

4357,"2002-09-04",3.7,"A dark reddish brown, with a light tan head.  This had a sweet slightly fruity flavor, and a malty, chocolatey profile.    Nice finish, slightly sweet, with a pinch of spicyness.","Portland, Oregon, USA","AxeMaster221"
4357,"2002-08-19",3.8,"Nice clear dark amber orange color. A tight bubbled tan head which covers the glass as you imbibe.  Rich caramel aroma with a hint of alcohol (aroma of many barley wines).  Slight paper flavors (Dated sample - best by October 2001, what should I expect for $0.75US). Flavors of light milk chocolate cover dates.  Quite sweet but the sweetness does not completely take over and finishes rather light.  Finish has some hints of vanilla.  I believe a fresh sample would be spot on.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

4357,"2002-07-20",4.3,"Dark reddish tan. Thin head. Smells of bready malt, with some yeastiness. Tastes much the same. This brewery doesnt seem to like hops much, although neither does the rest of Scotland; perhaps this is a Scottish Nationalist reaction to IPA... Nice interpretation of the style, anyway, quite full-bodied with a long, sweet finish.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"
4357,"2002-07-15",4.5,"Rich smoky aroma.  Sweet caramel malt and BBQed meats in the nose as well.  Something else is in there too, something sweet, like maybe chocolate-covered cherries.  Dark red-brown, large creamy stiff head.  Good retention.  Rich dark malt flavor, light smokiness, earthy hops under all of it.  A little chocolate.  Extra smooth.  Nice balance.  Thick sheets of lace.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

4357,"2002-02-06",4.1,"Clear copper with an initially fat rocky tiny bubbled head, leaves an intricate pattern of lace. Medium heavy carbonation for a Scottish ale. Slows but remains steady. Earthy aroma, peat and toffee and light dishwashing liquid. Medium bodied (body in a Broughton brew?) with a sultry malt backbone. Toffee, port and a crisp sweetness. Finally! A sip and savor, and fully enjoy, brew from these guys. Thick caramel maltiness and dried fruit slickness remain with each sip, as does a tangy smokiness (light but evident). Body has depth and actually fills your mouth. A nice brew that I will revisit often.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
