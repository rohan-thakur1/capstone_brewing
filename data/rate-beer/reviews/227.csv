Not complex, but again well made and insanely drinkable. I wish I could go on about this one how Tom went on about the Golden Ale, but instead I will tell a quick story. I was hella drunk at this point after drinking pretty much all day. My girlfriend was being a poon and my friend Killa Steve and I went to Ricks after I finished this beer thinking it would be a great idea. Apparently Ricks is ran by the mafia and used to be a whorehouse... some of the strippers were in their forties... it is not a whorehouse anymore.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
