1694,"2017-06-18",3.2,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, cookie), lightly to moderately hoppy (melon, flowers, apricot), lightly yeasty (basement), with note of bubble gum and candy sugar/syrup, hint of pepper.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, creamy/velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. 

Pretty candy-ish smelling, so fruity hops dont work so well with that profile...it ends up smelling a bit like artificial fruit taffy or something in that vein. Quite sweet in the mouth (this is more of a Weizenbock IMHO...7% and syrupy sweet?...yeah), albeit drinkable. Nice mouthfeel and nice lasting head are about all thats remarkable/enjoyable here for me. Not bad though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1694,"2017-06-05",4.0,"Bottle shared By Joey at Mile, pours an ultra hazy orange with small white head. Notes of honey, old school theee Floyds hoppy beer, marmalade, peach, and mango. Insanely tropical and hop forward which I love. Cheers","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

1694,"2017-03-10",4.0,"Aroma: puffing trains loaded with wheat clouds and marshmallow farm animals. residual kisses flutter down and about the tracks; an almost vinegar reverts to candy dust; dainty mouths spit cracked and slightly sizzling pepper seeds...

Taste: tropical fruit flowers -- blooming ripeness, contracting bitter birth -- flit through season cycles in a single breath. leather gloved fingers pick citrus bulbs from sweet-heavy arms. a farmhand sighs granola honey thoughts. dribbling down the incline between two small cottage rooms is the still perfumed bathwater of a resting muse...

Overall: soft honeyed Edenic dirt mingles lush vegetable blood with fallen ambrosial tarts...","British Columbia, CANADA","Kobold"

1694,"2016-12-13",3.8,"Bottle in Seattle. Purchased in BC. Nice soft foam on a rich orange hazed base. Lovely soft fruity aroma, terrific layering of sweet tropical hops and smooth weiss-yeast play. Fresh, clean and inviting. Smooth rich body, lots of heavy hefe character. Flavors are more or less awash in the juicy hops, but the style is always there. Pretty darn tasty.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"

1694,"2016-10-23",4.0,"Aromas of banana, guava, yeast, honey, orange. Appearance is a light Amber with a thing ring of head and some sticky lacing. Taste is honey, banana, orange, guava, jasmine and clove. Palate is medium bodied with a sticky sweetness that is followed by some back palate bitterness. Overall- a nice hoppy hefe, balanced between the estery profile of a tradition hefe and the hop flavour of an APA.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","rubyroo"
1694,"2016-10-23",4.3,"Bottle into glass. A very nice mild hoppy fruity aroma. Pours a hazy golden yellow with white head. Has a mild bitter taste. Medium bodied with an interesting aftertaste that is slightly sweet. Probably one of the more interesting beers I have tried in my time out West.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","DomD"
1694,"2016-10-08",3.7,"Bottle. Hazy burnt orange pour with a thick, frothy off-white head. Aroma is mostly tropical fruit, distinct passionfruit, nice and juicy. Hefeweizen character is quite subtle, but present if you get past the hops - some light banana, spice and wheat malt underneath. Taste is much the same, seems like really nice hoppy pale ale up front with lots of tropical fruit, but finishes with some softer hefe notes. Interesting take, and really tasty.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
1694,"2016-10-07",4.2,"One crazy beer. But in a good way. I taste no hefeweizen in this, but if it still tastes great who cares? Pours a deep muddy light orange. Attractive head and lacing. Massive aromas of tropical fruit... Mango, papaya, melon, some dank notes and a bit of cat pee. Tastes are big and juicy tropical fruit, hops, cereal grains. Excellent brew.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","cards04"
1694,"2016-09-23",3.8,"650 mL bottle. Lightly hazed gold pour, couple fingers of white, dense head, some lacing. Aroma is equal parts banana / clove hefeweizen and hoppy (resin and tropical fruit).

Woo! Thats how you do a wheat beer. Ive had the original Hopfenweisse - the G. Schneider & Sohn / Brooklyn Brewery collar - as well as Les Trois Mousquetaires kick at it, and even the surprisingly good Creemore Springs (Molson) rendition. To varying degrees, they all do the same thing: blend hefeweizen banana and cloves with forward American hops. This? Well, it does that sort of. By which I mean, it nukes your nose and tongue with huge PNW hops, then the few surviving taste buds report a little banana and clove in the finish. It aint pretty, and its subtle as a brick. So, of course, I love it. (And another gorgeous Driftwood label, too!) If youre a hophead like me, run, dont walk, to your local yadda yadda yadda. And to be crystal clear: if youre rating this as a hefeweizen, youre missing the point. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"
1694,"2016-06-26",3.4,"On tap at Darbys Gastown. Pours an almost clear golden, with a white head. Aroma is very strange as for German Hefeweizen very fruity, similar to grut, some tropical fruits, sweety. No banana, no smoked notes. Taste is quite similar to aroma. Non-intense hoppy bitterness aftertaste. Very strange beer, not a hefeweizen at all. Not bad though.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"

1694,"2016-05-09",3.8,"Bottle, shared with Grippitis. Slightly hazy orange-tinted gold, white head that leaves nice lace. Green grassy, slightly skunky hops, fruity undertones from the yeast, lightly sweet malts. This beer surprised me for a few reasons: having read Mosaic hops on the label, I expected a fruit salad, not a weed and grass. Second, this really bears no resemblance to a classic German hefe. Third, despite the first two points, I really enjoyed this brew.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
1694,"2016-05-05",3.6,"Poured from the tap. Orangey yellow with off white head. Bready sweet yeast malt with mild banana largely overnoted with tropical hops and subtle grassy hops. Not much of a hefe (traditionally), but as an experimental its quite good.","British Columbia, CANADA","pictoman"
1694,"2016-04-17",3.7,"Legs are toast... basically more worthless shrivelled up lumps of useless flesh dangling from my unused groinal area. This beer, however, is fully alive and worming its way into my lovely liver. Tantalizing scents of passionfruit and whatever else tropical - truly thick, sweet and awesome. There be cloves and banana in there as well lurking in the depths. Id say this is pretty much all hops and the weisse part is close to missing. Theres just so much fruit goodness. Yea, I can find the banana/clove/light spice and its happily buried deep. Im really enjoying this. What Im not enjoying is the local Nashville radio broadcast of the Ducks game - one of these dudes is such a fucking homer its sickening. Sounds like he is constantly pleading with the listener. What soup kitchen dumpster did they find this mumbling idiot? Driftwood rules. Love their beers.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

1694,"2016-04-09",4.4,"An amazing heffy aroma with all the esters of clove and banana (the magic of yeast).  And then the mosaic fruitiness of the hops the 7% comes through but with wheat and barley working it kind of comes off Belgian-ish than German ( even though the Hefe is clearly the style)","New Westminster, British Columbia, CANADA","BeerConsultants"
1694,"2015-08-23",3.6,"Visual: Stunningly colourful artwork on the label. Pours pale orange-brown with a smallish ultra foamy head, a thin 1mm layer of retention, sticky lacing, lots of scattered streams.

Nose: bright hoppy citrus, toffee malts. (lvl-7)-pungency

Attack: crisp-bubbly foamy

Mid-palate: herbacious hops, (lvl-6)-sweetness, (MAIN) toffee malts, orange citrus, banana

Finish: guava, light sour, dry-bitter hops, lingering malt, burpy.

Summary: Drinks more like an IIPA - heavy and hop forward. The initial 50% of the bottle goes down crisp and smooth, whilst the remainder ends up being hop-heavy on the palate. Still, overall pretty good.","","sulawang"

Nose is very hoppy for a hef, with all kinds of citrus hops, grass, and a little pot -- not really getting much hef quality here, maybe a touch of clove. Flavour reveals lots of weed- / pot-like hops, with some pronounced grassiness and banana-ish fruity esters. Very hoppy and well-rounded.
