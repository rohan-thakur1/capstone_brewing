2808,"2016-07-11",3.9,"Can at Level 42 tasting, big thanks to Elkeyess, 11/07/16.
Hazed golden blonde with a decent off white head that collapses to a swirl.
Nose is punchy hops, dank strokes, grapefruit, melon, pissy citrics, straw.
Taste comprises juicy hops, lemon rind, citric kissed straw, melon, tangerine, skunky hop, grapefruit dance.
Medium bodied, fine carbonation, drying close with a skunky hop lick.
Super solid fayre but may as well be classed as a SIPA or an APA with this amount of hopping instead of grabbing a top 50 spot in a style it doesnt resemble!","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"

2808,"2016-06-21",4.1,"Can shared by Nick on 6/10/16, as a palate cleanser. Love it!Good clarity throughout the waxen-yellow-golden body. White head atop is medium-sized and shows average retention.Cereal grains in the nose are balanced by honey-like malts and whole lotta juicy hops...Wow, this is way better than the Other Half IPAs Ive had (which are not very many, tbf). Mango, soft pineapple and a more dry nectarine with no pine. Some dank, spicy character on the finish, as well, with no alcohol or flaws.While there are a ton of IPLs out there which are really nothing more than just IPAs with a lager yeast pitched at a colder temperature, and I have no idea how traditional the mash or fermentation was on this, I will say that, while the hops arent traditional, the body is excellently dry, with a light graininess and brisk, tight carbonation. The finish is crisp and moderately bitter. Loved the stuff. No resin/twang to it whatsoever.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
