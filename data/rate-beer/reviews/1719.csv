1719,"2016-01-02",4.0,"Draught at Fate South, 12/28/15.Thoroughly hazy golden-amber body is topped by a white head with moderate-to-strong retention.Very light smokiness in the nose melds seamlessly with the other phenolics and could be passed off as just a particular phenol from a smokier than average yeast. Light clove, low banana/bubblegum and plentiful maltiness adding light bread, vanilla and honey. No alcohol or flaws.Malty and well-attenuated, with tight carbonation and very restrained on the undesirable esters/phenols (I hate heavy banana/bubble gum hefes). Smokiness is reserved but still enjoyable, though never does it make the beer seem particularly messy or unfocused. Light citrus and clove, with a soft, well-carbonated, spritzy texture. My favorite of the beers I had while I was there, slightly edging out the hatch chile golden.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1719,"2015-05-20",3.6,"Draft. Amber-orange with very soft cloudiness. A one-inch head of fluffy off-white descends slowly. Nice phenols. Big clove aroma, some banana, wheat, crackers, a mild hint of smoke. Balanced flavor profile. Nice cloves, a hint of banana, subtle smokiness. A bit of floral. Dry, phenolic finish. Smooth medium body, mild bubbles. Not too heavy. A solid hef. Could use a bit more smokiness if its going to bill itself as a smoked hef, though.","","PartyFowle"

1719,"2015-03-01",4.2,"Very nice all around hefe. Banana notes are more subdued; maltiness a bit more presence. An ever so slight kick as well.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"
1719,"2015-02-28",3.5,"Draft at the brewery. Pours opaque apricot gold with a fizzy white head. Tastes like sweet banana, dry clove, citrus hops, some bubblegum, and doughy malt. Light/medium body and carbonation. Smells like clove, banana, citrus malt, and dough.","baltimore, Maryland, USA","snoworsummer"
1719,"2014-08-20",4.1,"Nice banana aroma. Very cloudy appearance (like a hefe should). Taste is banana sweetness up front followed by light hops and mild wheat.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
1719,"2014-03-29",3.2,"Draft in a sampler at the brewpub. Pours a clear gold color with a small white ring for a head. Notes of orange, banana, pale and bready malts, wheat, and lemon-flavored tea. Light-bodied, with low to moderate carbonation and a smooth, dry mouthfeel. Average hefe; I didnt really get any smoky character, either.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1719,"2014-03-19",3.7,"Poured up on tap at the brewpub with a deep golden body that has lots of haze and supports a light tan head of foam. The aroma offers up big notes of sweetness, banana and cloves and not much else. The taste begins with smooth banana and a fairly firm spicy clove note before smooth sugary malts and modest malt sweetened smokiness murmurs to the surface. Pretty rich and bold for the style but pretty good too with a nice level of smokiness.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1719,"2014-03-04",4.2,"Tasted on the first day tapped, very dirty pours. Completely opaque bright/golden tan pour with ample white head. Aroma of wheat, sweet malt, and mellow banana. Flavor is more of the aroma, bready, rather full-bodied but refreshing.","Arizona, USA","JustDrinkIt"
1719,"2014-03-02",3.4,"Pours yellowish/orange color with white head. Typical banana and clove as expected with style and some smoke that is present for my palate. Im not a big smoked beer guy, so Im a little biased.","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"

1719,"2014-02-18",3.6,"Taster at the brewpub. The nose features very slight smoke followed by the more traditional hefe aromas of banana bread, cloves, and light cracked wheat. Pours cloudy light golden. Light taste of banana, heavy wheat astringency, and a bit of phenols. Medium body with dry lightly spiced finish. Solid.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
