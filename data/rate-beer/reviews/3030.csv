Full bodied, oily and chewy, with soft carbonation. Hot finish, with lots of golden raisins, more toffee, fruitcake, vanilla, raw alcohol, some woody dryness. Overall, this is a crazy beer.

Appearance: Pours a leather-brown body. No head or carbonation, which is to be expected.

Smell: High-octane alcohol which reminds me of a good whiskey. Heady & delightful!

Taste: Reminiscent of a good sherry or porto, strong in the forefront, kind of whispers at the end. Balanced through & through.

Mouthfeel: Warms the mouth, cloves & cherry in the palate with a dry, mild fruit-like (woodland berries) finish. A wood-like character permeates the taste but not overwhelmingly so. Definitely has a porto vibe to it. Sweet notes are also there but not sugary sweet, more of a warming, fruit-like sweetness, not artificial sweetness.

At first it was mead aroma, bourbon and wood, after a while alcohol shows up and dominates.
Taste is mid dry, woody with raisins, honey. A bit of vanilla, some caramel. 
Mouthfeel is medium, not very oily but getting there. Would love more body though. A lot of alcohol in taste
Very warming, you can feel the alcohol type of warming in the throat a long while after a sip. Finish is round and mellow, vanilla and wood

3030,"2017-01-19",5.0,"A review reconstructed from notes. Picked up a copper bottle of 10th anniversary version (2012) to have a taste-testing with friends and to split the cost (it is a very pricey bottle!). You really cant call this a beer, although its brewed with barley  but so is scotch! With an alcohol percentage of 29 percent for this vintage, I had to remind myself that I was drinking a beer when it seemed more like I was sipping a port, sherry, cognac, bourbon, and/or a scotch. Poured dark amber with no head or lacing, yet a swirl of the snifter leaves legs on the glass, like sipping hard liquor. Aroma is sweet malt, vanilla, caramel, maple, molasses, dried dark fruit, smoky wood, and alcohol. Flavor is all of the above plus brown bread with raisins, candied blood oranges, tobacco, earth, with a sweet, lingering burn from the booze. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, syrupy and sweet, yet not cloyingly so. A once-in-a-lifetime treat to myself!","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"

W kontrze nuty beczki dęblwej, mokrego drewna, sherry, wanilii.

Ive opened the bottle and shared some with friends a couple months ago, but figured Id give it a proper review this time. Served in a small tasting snifter (about an ounce or 2 pour), the beer pours a clear amber color with no head or lacing. Its similar to drinking whiskey, when I swirl it around in the glass you can see the ""legs"" sticking to the side of it. Aroma is rich, malty and boozy, the brew smells like vanilla, maple, molasses, dark fruit, wood, sweet spices and earthiness. Taste is sweet and actually not as boozy as I expected. Theres caramel, maple, molasses, wood, dark fruit, sweet spices, vanilla, candied oranges, Sherry, and earthy/tobacco flavors. Theres also a lingering sweet boozy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its a bit syrupy and slick with pretty much no carbonation. I really like this brew, its certainly a sipper. Utopias is similar to drinking a bourbon or Scotch, its pretty hard to compare this even to most craft beer.

Flavour is quite sweet but again slightly drier than a port, more older sherry-like. Raisins and other pale dried fruits, burnt sugars, a bit nutty, lots of wood. Finish is a touch soft and drier, nutty, slightly buttery wood, persistent vinousness, soft bitterness, some alcohol. Smooth, oily, no carb. Very much on the fortified wine side of things, though without the same intensity of finish that the best of them have.

3030,"2016-02-07",4.3,"Sampled bottle @ Struise Beerstroe in Bruges. This one is truly a legendary beer, I have read about and heard about this beer for about 6 years and I found out about its existence about one year in or so since I have started tasting beers. Needless to say that my excitement was at maximum level prior to me sampling this one. Overall, I am happy that I tried but I disagree with the common deScriptions that this beer truly tastes like no other beverage in the world. The profile on this one is that of oxidized beer, massively so coated in alcohol, it is strong, warming (but definitely not overly boozy) but the taste is really in line with what one would expect from a strong beer that contains components that have been aged for more than 20 years. Massive walnut, oxidation, chestnuts, low cardboard even, if you have had 10+ year old strong beers you are familiar with this profile. In that sense even with the high ABV, I wouldnt deem this one as a unique experience. It is a good, this one had plenty of vanilla from the oak, toffee etc. to work but it isnt something that I would deep being worth the price-tag looking only at the result (not the production efforts). Anyway it poured a very deep red copper. Needless to say zero sign of carbonation. Nose is massive oxidation, leaves, walnuts, big sherry in there with lots of sugar, almost bourbon oak notes, oak vanilla, some juniper berries, nettles, low cardboard coated in warming alcohol, clear alcohol in the nose but it is good quality, not overly boozy, pleasant, warming. Taste is big oxidation, big sherry, walnut, herbal nettles, thick licorice, strong alcohol presence but not overly boozy, coats the throat, low cardboard, big oak vanilla, lots of sherry, light touch of bourbon , Flat, thick, warming, coats the throat, dash cough syrup. Interesting & nice, plenty of toffee, oak, vanilla etc. to balance out the oxidation, some unexpected notes, herbal nettles, low licorice, warming, alcohol makes it work, big sweetness, good oxidation.

3030,"2016-01-25",4.8,"Jai bu la version 10ème anniversaire;
Une vraie belle expérience. Je crève labcès : oui, bien trop chère pour ce que cest. Bouteille à acheter et déguster à plusieurs, entre connaisseurs (pas forcément de bière, les amateurs de cognac ou porto auront leur compte).
De manière générale, ce produit offre une incroyable complexité. Il y a de quoi se faire plaisir.
Nez : beaucoup dalcool, ça fera pas de mal de la laisser respirer un quart dheure. Beaucoup de rhum, de notes de vanille/chocolat, de fruits jaunes, un bourbon qui part franchement sur le biscuit, des notes plus douces et rondes de caramel, des légers airs de vieux porto et de très belles notes de Grand Marnier !
La bouche est très alcoolisée mais très buvable. Plus que lagressivité, on ressentira surtout la chaleur dans la gorge. Le tout est incroyablement rond, liquoreux, très agréable et bien fait. La grande dominante est le couple vanille/caramel qui pète littéralement et en fait quasiment un dessert de premier choix ! Un peu de pomme. Moins de longueur quon aurait pu lespérer. Mais celle-ci portera plutôt sur le bourbon/biscuit.
Très chouette, un vrai plaisir. A partager absolument.","Lyon, FRANCE","Bawelt"

The smell is incredibly rich, something between a bourbon, a cherry and a brandy (as far away from beer as I have ever smelled), blended with caramel, vanilla, raisins and, of course, alcohol, especially right after the pour.
As was expected, the taste is quite complex. Rich caramel sweetness up front, together with vanilla, toffee, maple syrup, notes of bourbon, a bit of wood and much, much more. Figs and other dried fruit right after that - raisins and dried plums - as well as dark cherries. A very nutty aftertaste, with different flavours unfolding after every sip.

APPEARANCE ? dark brown with some reddish tints. No carbonation & no head.

FLAVOR ? also hot, but the sweetness is the most prominent flavor (aside from the alcohol). The flavor is deep and rich, with strong caramel malty flavor and fruity (think cherry) notes. The mouthfeel makes this beer feel like its in my mouth long after the end of the last sip.

3030,"2015-02-27",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2017 After having tasted thousands of beers in most of the styles in existence, I thought it was about time to confront myself with something really special, the legendary Sam Adams Utopias, in its 10th Anniversary edition. Unpacking the bottle of this famous barley wine made me feel like a child opening a really exciting Christmas present... The bottle in itself is as arty as it is fun, you even get to play with the little doors of the kettle. Removing the cap immediately released a very strong, beguiling aroma. Very promising indeed... The colour is a beautiful, very deep and intense, transparent but slightly hazy bronze with a lovely Marangoni effect (tears, as we say in Dutch), lacking even the slightest form of carbonation, so no fizz nor head - which would be totally irrelevant in this beer anyway. The aroma is... well, a challenge to describe, but extremely complex, noble, elegant, pointy, powerful and enticing. I get hints of all kinds of wonderful things: old tawny port, old and oxidized medium dry sherry or madera, fine brandy, chocolate liqueur, hint of sweet tobacco, lots of vanilla tannins, candied figs, blueberries, caramel candy, a hint of the soy sauce I remember from that vintage Samuel Adams Triple Bock I tasted last year and which apparently is physically part of this beer too, artisanal acacia honey, strong maple syrup, eucalyptus, candied orange, slight beef stock (growing stronger with ageing apparently)... The taste is, if anything, even more exciting: warming alcohol hits the tongue and mouth cavity in instants but never gets wry or overpowering - instead it provides a wonderfully exciting spiciness; a refined, noble maple syrup sweetness spreads over the tongue, a faint salty accent only adds balance and the caramelly malts linger in the background, providing structure and reminding you in an ever so subtle way that this is still beer. The overall taste is sweet but in an incredibly complex, multi-layered way, as in a very old and high quality tawny port; drying tannins, beautifully vanilla-like and woody, come to the foreground in the finish, where the profound complexity of malts, complex and refined, bourbon-, port- and rhum-like alcohol and sugary sweetness persist. The alcohol heat remains gentle and together with the strong oaky tannins, provides a long, drying, warming and totally satisfying finish. There even seems to be a kind of chili burn to it...  In fact, minutes after swallowing this, it seems as if more flavours come up and disappear again. I had my share of fine single malts, cognacs and maderas, but this beats everything... I felt a bit intimidated at first, not sure if I was mature enough as a beer fanatic to deserve a treat like this, but I can honestly say that this was one of the most memorable beer experiences I had so far. The complexity of this beverage is seemingly infinite. If you are able to enjoy a fine liqueur every now and then, this is the beer equivalent of it, which deserves its cult status completely. As for the price: this bottle cost me a small fortune, being about three and a half times as expensive as the second most expensive beer I ever bought, so the question of whether it is worth the money comes naturally. Personally, I do not regret buying this whatsoever, every ounce is worth its price, especially considering the fact that the bottle is resealable and can be treated in much the same way as a precious bottle of your favorite single malt, old cognac or any other liquor. As for me, I will guard the bottle with deer life, only to return to it just every now and then, for special occasions, so I will keep enjoying this over and over again for a long time to come. Pushing the boundaries of the concept of beer, I am glad I finally tasted this, after having read about it for 13-odd years. Man, what a treat... But a difficult one to rate - in fact, rating this at all seems irrelevant, as it is so out of the ordinary that it forms a gastronomic experience in its own right.  Ages well, too, as opening and closing the bottle regularly obviously creates a lot of oxidation, only to lead to an old port-like effect after a few years, albeit one with a notable umami presence (beef stock-like aromas), only proving that this beer keeps evolving in an interesting manner as it ages.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Aroma: Instantly fills the room. Honey, toffee, vanilla, maple. When the glass is held closer to the nose, theres just enough heat to give it a little tickle.

Appearance: Clear, dark mahogany body. No visible carbonation at all. Slow, thick legs take forever to travel down the glass. Beautiful.

Taste: Butterscotch, honey, maple, toffee, sherry, caramel, milk chocolate, Snickers. Cognac.

Palate: Take a small sip, just enough to coat your tongue. Let it sit and slowly press upwards towards the palate. It feels like butterscotch candies melting on your tongue. Creamy, melty, ever so slightly syrupy. Plenty of alcohol heat, but its a slow, mellow burn. Its not a blazing fire, its the cozy, warm coals.

thanks go to Brian D for opening this bottle for us.
A- Pours a dark copper red with no head. Very appealing to the eye as you can see the legs cling to the glass.
S. Alcoholic raisins but in a good way with hints of toffee along with the slight burn of alcohol.
T- Raisins, toffee, burnt caramel. You definately get the alcohol but its not a bad burn at all very pleasant actually. very little to no carbonation.
M- has the feel of a port/sherry with medium viscosity and a slight burn on the outer part of the tongue.
O- This is an amazing beer if you can call it that. while $200 is steep if you can find a shot in a bar for $20-$25 i would definately say its worth it to those that want to try it atleast once. I on the other hand while mostly likely be tracking down each release if my bank account permits it.

3030,"2013-02-24",4.3,"10th anniversary edition shared with some friends. Clear mahogany pour with no head and no carbonation. Coats the glass like motor oil. Very strong aroma. Has a lot of maple syrup, butterscotch, wood, toast, and alcohol with a touch of dark fruit. Initially there is the a strong hot punch of alcohol when you take a sip, then it goes into maple syrup, caramel, dark fruits, barrel, a just a hint of hop bitterness. Alcohol becomes less noticeable as you go. Thick and sticky on the palate. Quite the experience. Glad I was able to get my hands on some of this.","Corinth, Texas, USA","jhamp9"

3030,"2013-02-11",4.3,"This poured a thick ruby red color with no head at all, big surprise.   Aroma was all over the place in a good way, straight alcohol heat, lots of port and sherry notes, loads of toffee and caramel, dried dark fruits, and some barrel/woody notes too.  Flavor was similarly complex, good amount of sweetness, but never cloying.  Alcohol is certainly stomach warming, but not to the point where its offensive.  Lots of barrel and great barleywine characteristics come together to create this huge experience.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"

Talk about making a friend feel welcome!  Pours a very warm amber with no head.  This is still.  The aroma reminds me very much of the Lagavulin I had only a few nights earlier.  There are obvious alcohol notes, but there is lovely mild smokiness, oak, and caramel.  The flavor is much more like a fine sherry than a scotch with ample caramel, malt, dark fruit, mild smokiness, oak and vanilla.  Very rich with a luxurious silky texture on the palate.

3030,"2013-01-18",4.2,"2007, thanks Denise! Booze initially dominates the aroma, yet subsides to reveal cherries, oak, vanilla, other dark fruits, caramel, and more booze.

After having multiple vintages of Utopias, the beer still surprised me with its viscosity. Massively thick, creamy, silky. Perfect.

Exceptionally complex: dark fruits, oak, vanilla, and booze everywhere. Reminds me of cognac; alcoholic warmth integrates nicely, doesn't hide the fact that it's 27%. Damn, this stuff is good.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

Again, theres loads of caramel and sweet malts along with fruits, wood, alcohol and brandy. Mouthfeel is thick and sirupy. Warming/burning alcohol. Extreme and extremely interesting beer!

3030,"2013-01-06",4.2,"Review #600. 10th Anniversary Edition served in the accompanying Riedel glass.

A: Pours completely still. Clear brown in color with some ruby highlights intertwined. Some massive legs and stick draping along the side of the glass.

S: Very hot and boozy up front. Overt alcohol and spirts with some hotness to it. Underneath that you get some maple sweetness and burnt sugar. Some caramel and toffee notes are present as well. Dark fruit complexities show themselves as well when it starts to hit room temp.

T: Caramel sweetness with a ton of vanilla. Oak with a great malty backbone. The alcohol doesnt compete with the complexities of this beer even though its over 27%. Heat on the finish with a mix of toffee, roasted figs and raisins. 

M: Incredibly smooth and rich with a warming finish. Devoid of carbonation with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel.

O: This is the pinnacle of sipping beers. Sweet, complex and warming. This is a beer I will savor for a long time.

3030,"2012-12-20",4.7,"Finally got to try this epic brew thanks to John C. Thanks for the taste buddy. I must admit that it wasnt really what I expected. Thats a good thing, because I was completely blown away. I heard that this was great, but I was expecting an ice-bock flavor. I was expecting boozy. Utopias is strong without a doubt but is rather well balanced in its flavor. This should be impossible given how much alcohol it contains. Its also a crazy ass blend with more complexity than any beer that Ive ever tried. It has notes of fruit, port, raisins, figs, soy sauce, fish sauce, sake, roast, malts, bread. I could go on but I cant quite remember everything. This is a beer that has crazy high expectations but somehow manages to deliver. I cant believe it, but this beer experience is actually worth the price of admission.","Brentwood, Tennessee, USA","MmmcKay"

3030,"2012-12-12",4.2,"Teeny tiny sample in a little clear screw top vial. Beggars cant be choosers. Great thanks to Alden for gifting this to me. Looks like a 1/4 of an ounce in here. Poured into my smallest tasting snifter. Ohhh, that minuscule amount of beer has such an amazing nose! Wow! Jesus, that nose makes me shudder and twitch. Huge vanilla, wood, light chocolate, wet forest, big spice, booze soaked cake. All this from just the smell alone, which does you the solid of lingering in your nostrils. Appearance may be skewed from my sample size, but what Im seeing is just a totally clear brown color with zero head, but fantastic legs. Its possible that alcohol fumes are going to my head, but the aroma is just top notch. Big sweetness, molasses, spice booze-cake, Belgian waffles, light chocolate, baked apple, maple syrup, earthy and herbal notes in the flavor. Also hard to judge palate, as I was taking the tiniest sips possible, here, but texture was more dry, probably little-to-no carbonation. Big body. The super long and powerful aftertaste cant be emphasized enough. ABV was certainly noticeable, but with the tiny sips I was taking, tolerable enough to let the liquid just sit on my tongue for a second or two (long enough for a solid exhalation) before swallow. Wasnt bothersome one bit, alcohol just helps to bring out that incredible aroma. Amazing beer to savor.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

Palate coating. Alcohol masterfully hidden. Brandy, toffee, booze, oak, port, scotch, smoke. Just terrific. A great choice for an after dinner sipping beer.

Very complex aroma with many levels, but the ethanol detracts and distracts.  Transparent dark amber body with no head.  Viscous, with good legging.  Starts almost astringent, fruity, and rather sweet.  Some oxidation follows and sherry flavors come through in the middle.  Finishes a bit acetic and heavily ethanolic.

3030,"2012-10-11",3.3,"2011 Vintage. bottle #01979. Enjoyed in a snifter at cellar temp (60 Degrees F). Shared with my neighbors after pounding Bud Light.

A - Huge alcohol legs like Brandy on the edge of the glass. Minor sediment in the glass. Looks like a very fine cognac or brandy. Very cedar bronze color with hints of a chocolate bar color (milk chocolate brown).

S - The first thing I get is caramel. This is followed by a nutty toffee and heavy maple syrup. Theres a combination of charred oak and sweet vanilla but maybe Im confusing the maple and vanilla. Both are very sweet. Ive sniffed the hell out of this and my nostril is growing tired. The booze burns every bit of my nose.

T - Wow. This is very hard because, up front, its very sweet. The burnt caramel and ""100 grand bar"" taste is big, sweet and tastes like its a fresh backed sweet pasty right out of the oven. It covers my mouth and stays around forever. Its this maple oaky cedar and lemon wood sweet bomb like candied sugar and toffee. Theres this pure cane syrup finish and a huge vanilla bourbon finish as it fades away. After a minute, theres a hint of smokiness.

M - Extremely heavy body, absolutely no carbonation. This is a chewy beer although no need to even say that, right? 

O - This is a love hate beer. Its incredibly balanced. There is no doubt about that. However, its a 27% beer thats so close to whiskey yet entirely too sweet to be whiskey. The sweetness needs to be turned down and perhaps time will do that. I am enjoying sipping on this.

The kettle seems to add to the whole nuance of the beer.  The appearance is great - it pours a wonderful dark clear mahogany with bright amber, red, and purple highlights - no head at all - but great legs.  Aroma nose is definitely hot, but does not burn excessively, and a dark earthy fruitiness pervades the aroma.  The flavor is more complex - dark rum soaked fruits, figs, plum, honey, tobacco, cherry, chewy caramel candies. And it drinks much more like a fine port or sherry than a beer. It burns the lips just a bit as it goes down. A delicious sipper for certain.  Worthy of the pricetag?

3030,"2012-03-28",3.8,"2007 bottle courtesy of Enjoyit, beeranarchist and MPA. It doesnt have a head. and its dark brown. The aroma reminds me a lot of a kind of dried figs in caramel sauce that you can buy in cans. Just totally awesome caramel thing going on - brown sugar like muscovado. Along with the figs, theres also a bright grape notes to the aroma - much like a dessert wine. Notes of tobacco, a meaty heaviness, too - almost like an air-dried italian ham. A really nice hazelnut/chocolate note in the back of it. An oxidated feeling surrounds the whole aroma, leaning towards being a bit too much, though not overpowering. And then a good kick of alcohol heat to complete the circle. Surprisingly little woody considering how many different types of barrels this one mustve been on. I really like the aroma.
The taste follows the aroma - lots and lots of sweetness, almost syrupy. Notes of figs, caramel, dates, chocolate, a good deal of oxidation. All this sweetness and oxidation is complemented by a distinct alcohol presence throughout the entire palate, creating a masochistic sort of balance. To diametral opposites on the taste spectrum - to be frank, its cloying and hot - but still OK drinkable for a 27% beverage. Intensely complex and a very interesting late night drink.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"

3030,"2012-03-13",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/24/2011.  2011 bottle poured from an elegant copper coated ceramic bottle into a tasting glass.

As were my expectations, this has a look I am more accustomed to seeing in a brown liquor, maybe a cognac. A few stray bubbles very briefly collected for a moment before quickly vanishing. 

Wow, there is a ton going on in the aroma. There is a lot of sweetness, with aromas ranging from vanilla to molasses. Some caramel and other sweet malts are noticeable, as well as oak, some general dark fruits, and maple.

The flavor has an incredible presence. The sweetness includes caramel, molasses, vanilla, maple, and dark fruits, with a malt that drags on through the finish. Other notes of port and cognac, as well as a general oak character, are present as well. 

Utopias has a huge body, with almost no carbonation and a fairly sticky nature. This is actually one of the few things that clues me in that it is not a liquor; it is sticky instead of dry. It goes down surprisingly smooth with an alcohol presence of a much lower ABV beer.

When a beer can be opened and still stored for weeks (or months), the line between beer and liquor has justifiably become blurred. There is just an incredible amount of complexity involved with this beer that makes it very difficult to judge. Did I really enjoy it? Yes, it was amazing. Could I drink more than 4 oz.? That would be tough. Do I regularly want to pay $165 for a bottle of it? Probably not. Scoring this beer is difficult.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Nose is ultra starchy and rice wine like specifically huangjiu or yellow alcohol, Chinese rice wine, which you can actually enter into ratebeer. Example: http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/shaoxing-pagoda-hua-t Its tough to describe but heavy red bean starch, sweet toffee, not as much smoke and rice character as huangjiu and more savory soy and saltwater. As it opens up/decants you are rewarded with cinnamon and amaretto. Still, enormous umami character like chicken stock and beef bouillon. Interesting combo. Taste is sour lemon up front with mild alcohol heat ending with big starchiness and more lemon. Mild oxidized character. Interesting. Alcohol heat is not an issue. Palate seems decently viscous. Hard to compare to other barleywines as this is more like brandy and rice wine blended.

I agree with comments that it could hardly be described as a beer - it definitely tastes more like Port or Sherry. Clear reddish brown colour.

3030,"2011-11-01",4.1,"THOUGHTS: Definitely in the same family as Triple Bock, but even more refined. Very Liquor like. I cant wait for it to age over the years. The hops are only really present to prevent it from being cloying. Layer upon layer of aromas and flavors. More and more as it breathes. A little too much alcohol burn in the flavor to taste the full extent of the flavors present. So much potential. If the flavor eventually lives up to the aroma this could be incredible in a couple years. Gave it a couple bonus points for the packaging and the incredible effort.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark, reddish, amber that was nearly dark brown in the glass with no head or carbonation, but with beautiful legs. Everything about the aroma was heavy. There was heavy port, wood, soy sauce, maple syrup, vanilla, alcohol, all different spices, different liquors, sherry, and licorice. The initial flavor was moderately to heavily sweet with alcohol burn; while the finish was nearly harshly sweet and lightly bitter with heavy alcohol burn and an average to long duration of flavor and long on alcohol burn. There was alcohol, lots of different liquors, wood, vanilla extract, maraschino cherry, maple syrup and molasses. The medium to full body was oily with no carbonation and heavily alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

3030,"2011-08-19",4.7,"This was available at Boulevard Tavern in Gateway - Fort Myers, FL. 2 ounce pour from the 750ml Utopias bottle into a snifter by the bartender. 

Appearance: Pours a clear dark brown color reminiscent of flat cola. No head, no lacing as to be expected from a beer of this ABV%. There are nice legs to it reminiscent of a nice whiskey or cognac. 

Smell: Sweet caramel, wet walnuts, dark fruits and alcohol. It smells hot, but not overpoweringly so. 

Taste: Sweet caramel, vanilla, dark fruit. This is very complex and delicious. The alcohol is obviously there, but it doesnt overpower the flavors at all. There is a nice nutty/woody characteristic thats hard to define. The aftertaste is sweet and wonderful. Overall, the flavor is quite sweet and I love it. 

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and quite creamy. No carbonation at all. Theres a clear alcohol burn going down, which is to be expected. 

Drinkability: High drinkability. I really wish I had more than this 2 ounce pour. I could drink a few of these. 

Overall: Amazing beer overall. I am so glad that I shelled out $15 for a 2 ounce pour. This would rate as as good a whiskey/cognac as Ive ever had. Phenomenal. If you have the chance, try it.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

T - Alcohol burn is surprisingly well hidden. Very complex with sweet caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and syrup providing the background.

The aroma just blows my mind away! There is just so much of it and its so complex that my little brain has somewhat difficulties processing all the different elements. Strong and stingy alcohol with wood and oak, theres chocolate notes, a good dash of bourbon and cognac, something that reminds me of champagne, sweet raisins, plums and dates. It has a sticky, syrupy and burning mouthfeeling, no carbonation and really full-bodied. The flavors definitely keeps up with the complexicity of the aroma - and then some. Tastes beautifully with a fantastic and dominating sweetness from raisins, prunes and dates. My lord, this is undoubtfully one of the best beers Ive ever tasted. The flavors continues with drying almond peal(which btw. is something Ive never tasted in a beer before), port wine, cognac, some nice sweet sherry-notes, vanilla, oak and some dark caramel.

The taste is very sweet, like a Tawny port, where there are some molasses, prunes and raisins are quite prevalent. This beer had almost no carbonation to speak of and was quite syrupy. Overall, not a lot of complexity to this beer, mostly very concentrated fruit juice. The alcohol became more noticeable as you exhaled.

3030,"2011-05-15",4.8,"Managed to get hold of this legendary beer through fellow Ratebeerian Abstractbeer, who actually heeded the call from a dream I had about getting Utopias (!) and went over the Swedish border just to get this one for me from Systembolaget. Thanks a million bro! :-D Im now approaching my 1000th beer, and I figured no. 999 should be an epic one too. And this one is, indeed. Samuel Adams Utopias was the first ""super-big beer"" I heard of, through mainstream media and long before I was a beer geek. Its one of the most pricey beers (not including eBay sharking and insane auctions) available to the general public and a milestone in extreme brewing, serving as an inspiration for many others. I carefully pour a tiny amount of this deep, cognac-hued clear brown liquid into my snifter and contemplate it for a while. Then, I lift it to the nose and wait for the explosion to trigger: port, sweet malts, hints of smoke, cognac, booze, Brazil nuts, wood and caramel. What a complexity! Ahead, there is more of the same and then some: booze, cognac, tobacco, port, wood, caramel, tar, oak, peanuts, smoke, vanilla, sherry, bourbon, toffee - this is pretty much everything one can possibly unload in a beer, but incredibly enough: it works. The warming, boozy and yet soft palate leaves my taste buds in a state of transcendental consciousness; they are clearly in sensory overload. So much of everything here, and yet so smoothly blended! An awesome beer for sure, and the only reason Im holding back the rating is because its so unique that its hard to compare against anything else - and also because of the price, which is slightly ridiculous after all. Need to try more super-strong beers (only had the Tactical Nuclear Penguin so far) to put it more in perspective. Nevertheless, this is a brew any beer geek should try at least once. :-)","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

3030,"2011-04-27",4.6,"First, a small story: 
Ive been forunate enough to be able to taste this thanks to the extreme generousness of fellow ratebeerian ClubGonzo! The process of
aquiring it started with a dream, an interpretation of that dream, ClubGonzo BMing me with an idea, and the formulation of a plan.
This beer is pretty much impossible to aquire here in Norway, but the plan ended yesterday when I took a trip to Sweden to get this legendary nectar, and succeeded, despite the cashier who had big troubles
believing me when I said I wanted to buy this beer, which cost about (literally!) 100 times more than a regular swedish lager (which probably was his reference point). I probably made his day :)
 
So I open the bottle and pour myself a small amount into a cognac glass, to taste it, before I ship it to ClubGonzo and his crew of mighty beergeeks!
 
No carbonation, as expected. The color is a deep ruby red.
Extremely complex aroma with at least the following components, probably many more: cognac, alcohol, leather, tobacco, wood, chocolate, earthy, dark ripe fruits.
Holy mouthfeel, Batman! Its thick as a brick! Or at least, thick as a port wine. Yes, thats it, it feels quite like a sweet port wine.
The flavor is insane. Sweet cognac, port wine, ripe fruits, tobacco, leather, wood, caramel, licorice. Its like drinking everything all at once. Port wine, red wine, white wine, beer, cognac, you name it, this beers got it.
Im at a loss for words here. This is a jillion miles away from anything Ive ever tasted. Theres so much going on in this drink that I dont know if Ill be able to discover it all even if I dedicate the better part of my life to it.
When it comes to taste, it touches on pretty much everything - sweet, sour, bitter & salty - probably umami as well! Holy c*ap! As expected the alcohol is quite noticable, mainly in the form of a pleasant burn when you swallow.
 
Obviously a beer you sip slowly. A masterpiece.","NORWAY","abstractbeer"

Slightly port-like in the flavour with oak.  Its mildly sweet, complex but mellow.  Very balanced for its strength and not overpowering, which is impressive.

Pours a luminescent toffee with crimson edges, though, as the pour progressed and the six years of settling began to hold sway from the mouth of madness at the top of all that copper, the pour got darker and murkier, until a syrupy brown filled the last glassfull or two. Enormously dense and complex sweet nose, tons of sugary goodness vying for your attention--toffee, butterscotch, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, rum notes, just so much happening. Thick sticky body, but surprisingly smooth and approachable given the age and the abv. All the sweet goodness from the nose returns for the mid-palate.

The aroma initially reminded me of a great Polish mead, with some honey and maple syrup sweetness up front; following that came notes of oak, sherry, brown sugar, nuts, and herbs, but really those sweet, woody, warm alcoholic notes up front tended to dominate the aroma throughout. The flavor followed along the same lines, with honey and maple syrup sweetness, oak, fruits, caramel, and warming alcohol throughout. Full-bodied, with negligible carbonation and a sticky, sweet, coating honey mouthfeel. I was impressed by the subtlety of the alcohol in all of this, and loved the way it all worked together.

In fact, I would fully recommend to anyone that if you dont have the money to purchase more than one of these, WAIT ON YOUR BOTTLE!  It will only get better!!


Pours an incredible copper gold color, which seemed to get darker towards the end of the bottle.  The liquid was slightly murky, but very see through at the same time.  Looks thick.  The nose on this is simply stunning.  Caramel, peaches, sweet thick malts, maple syrup, slight hints of booze, bready, and ever so gently toasted.


The flavors transpose into similar realms.  Sweet and thick malts up front, covered with maple and caramel.  Light fruits and hints at citrus make a lot of the body, coating your palate in wave of enjoyment.  Vanilla, and washes of sweet oak flavors meld with this, moving into a very bourbon/port like finish that lingers with hints of all these flavors blended with a nice touch of booze.  Incredibly warming down the gullet...!!


Overall, this was a complete beer (or whatever you want to call this one) experience.  Kept this baby in the fridge proper for all five years.  Worked out beautifully!  While this can definitely seem expensive, especially if youre paying more than retail (about $100) for it, I strongly feel that if youre into the best flavors out there, suck it up, go in on a bottle of this with a few friends, age it for 3+ years, and have GREAT night enjoying this one slowly.

2009 Edition poured into a Portsmouth tulip.

A: Pours a deep mahogany with absolutely no head or lacing, to be expected at 27% and without carbonation. Beautiful colors show up as its swirled in the tulip.

S: Beautiful with plenty of alcohol right off the start. Behind this, there is a lot of wood, vanilla, molasses, dark sweet malt, dark cherries, maple, sherry, and port.

T: Loads of alcohol. After the first sip, I got used to the alcohol and found the treasure trove of beautiful flavors beneath. Lots of maple, sherry, port, wood, and vanilla. All beautifully combined into an absolutely soothing beverage.

M: Very hot and medium bodied. Not too much of a burn. Not too sweet; complex and even somewhat delicate.

D: Supremely drinkable. The 2-or-so-ounce pour that I got was enough to last me a long while, and I kept discovering new things with each small sip. Next time around, I think Ill definitely grab a bottle of this to hold onto for a while.

3030,"2010-03-04",4.5,"2007 version. Wow... Let me say wow.

The little booklet was really informative and well written. ""No perceptible carbonation..."" no kidding! This beer is beyond beer. The fact that it still can be called a beer is an impressive feat of craft brewing.  It looks and moves nothing like a beer, rather a liquor, and I suppose that makes complete sense. Wow, what a beer. 

The alcohol leaves itself on the edges of the glass like a lacing... Its thick and thin all at the same time, like a high-octane fuel laced with a godly nectar. The color: a brown-orange-yellow.  Its aroma: all-enveloping, and much like a really great port. Resiny, malty, spicy, woody, and almost fruity. Potent! There may be hops in the nose, but I cant tell for sure.  I do know one thing for sure: itll be warm in the gullet! 
 
A little of this goes a long way in the mouth. Talk about a sipping beer!  This sips like a liquor.  It covers the inside of your mouth with an explosion of hefty flavor, followed by a spicy syrup that makes its way down to the throat... And the burn... So sweet...

The cheeks stay puckered for a minute or two while your mouth sweats and rinses itself out with saliva, reigniting the experience as your palate revives itself.  And then the gut burn... So warm... So cozy. Sweet heaven sticks to your lips. So sweet, so perfect.

This is one excellently balanced, well crafted beer for the ABV (imagine brewing something this strong and having it taste good, let alone taste like anything at all), so impressive all around that I dont want to finish my 1.5 ounces. Tell ya what though, it takes a while to drink just a little bit. A bottle of your own will keep you in utopia for quite a while. Just dont hurt anyone trying to defend the bottle from scavengers.

3030,"2010-03-01",4.1,"Review is from a 2007 bottle.

A: The pour is flat (as I expected), and a lovely caramel/copper color with a nice reddish hue to it.

S: The nose really has some wonderful things going on. Rich caramel, maple, vanilla, and a slight chocolate aroma that I really did not expect. The only knock on it is that the alcohol can burn the nostrils a bit.

T: While the alcohol is still of course very present on the palate, its much more manageable. The maple, vanilla, caramel, brandy, brown sugar, and chocolate flavors are intense and absolutely wonderful.

M: While the flatness really doesnt work with most beers, I find it to be quite nice with this one. The body is absurdly full and rich.

3030,"2010-02-05",4.4,"Im very grateful to ericandersnavy (through thirdeye11) for the chance to sample this one.  Bottle #8291 from 2009.  It took me 45 minutes to finally stop smelling it and drink it.  Deep, dark honey pour with no head.  Swirling in the glass leaves nice legs around the sides.  Complex, rich, layered aromas of oak, bourbon, alcohol, candied dark fruits, vanilla and molasses.  Flavor is just as complex and rich:  brown sugar, caramelized brown sugar, oak, dark berries, plum, alcohol, maple bars, toasty, roasty and toffee.  This hit my sweet spot perfectly.  Thin mouthfeel with a wonderful warming finish.  Much, much smoother than expected.  Of course the alcohol is present in the nose and taste, but, IMHO, it didnt overpower or detract from the overall experience.  A must try for any serious beer enthusiast.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","BarZigKin"

Pours dark amber with no head. The aroma is maple syrup, vanilla and caramel. The flavor is alcohol, sherry, port, caramel, vanilla and maple syrup. Thin mouthfeel and no carbonation. The alcohol is pretty hot as you would expect for a beer of this strength, but the complex flavors and aromas make the beer outstanding.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3030,"2010-02-04",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2012 Strong beer tasting at Youll Never Walk Alone in Kolding. Thanks to Torben for making this available! Deep red amber with no head. Huge aroma of malt, dried fruits, fortified wines, alcohol and a touch of leather. Barley wine aroma, only more of everything. The flavour is extreme. Dried fruits, sherry and port wine. Very sweet with warm and somehow quite rounded alcohol. Fruity aftertaste with a lot of raisin and a hint of walnuts. Impressive experience and surprisingly beer-like. For someone who doesnt like sweet stuff in general I have a weakness for well made barleywines. And this is one of them!","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"
3030,"2010-02-03",3.7,"Dark ruby red with an orange tinge, and not surprisingly, no head. The aroma is massive. There is definitely a lot of alcohol there, but loads of raisin, prunes and other dried fruits, rum, and slightly burnt caramelized sugar. Smells like a liqour, drinks like a liquor. Hot, oily, yet sort of dry in the finish. I enjoyed it, but probably not enough to pay that sort of money for one small glass again. Too hot, too sweet.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"

Aroma is is tons of alcohol among other things.  A little chocolate, dark fruit, alcohol, toffee, brown sugar, red wine, roasted nuts, and brandy.  Taste is red wine, strawberries, vanilla, alcohol, serious fruit, caramel, more alcohol, and pancake syrup.  Finish is thick and hot.  Awesome bottle.  Id actually split this again should the opportunity arise.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Fratto"

It was well worth it, especially for the drunk pictures I took with the bottle later.  Clear ruby red pour.  I peeked into the bottle window and said hello to the awesomeness inside it. I swirled the hell out of it and there was no head to be found. Huge alcohol nose. Smell that curls the nose hairs. After that there is candied sugar, raw apple and snozeberries. Thick rich legs. Very alcoholic on the nose. Taste is incredibly complex. Huge flavors of brown sugar, black cherries, alcohol and oak aged wood fill the palate. Literally my nose is tingling every time I bring the glass up. Insane. Like waffle syrup on the nose, but hot. Damn. Large taste of maple syrup also. Drips down the throat. This is fantastic. A sipper no doubt. Hot hot hot as it warms. Glad to finally get the chance to try this bad boy!","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

Some definite heat to it and a full rich vinuous flavor.  I enjoyed this but would not compare it favorably with other spirits at this price point.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
3030,"2010-01-24",3.8,"2 cl sample at Patricks. Is 2 cl really enough to get an impression of a beer? Normally not, but in this case I will definitively say yes. Aroma and flavor is so strong that both stays for a long time and make it impossible to taste anything else for a long time. The body is beautiful, its deep golden mahogany with no carbonation and head at all. The beer is floating oily around in the glass leaving traces like thick Soya on the sides. The aroma is so intense that I just had to stay with this a long time without even considerate tasting it. It has a complexity that make it difficult to compare with anything else and describe. There is a lot of alcohol, similar to Madeira and Sherry, but with a strong fusel that clearly states that this is something completely different. There is a mix of dry fruit here as well, at least raisins, prunes and probably a hint of old, dry peaches or apricot, its difficult for me to find the exact match. Some other fumes indicate something light roasted or caramelized; this could be oily dry fruit or Soya. The flavor is also really heavy, the first little sip indicates just a mess of sweetness, alcohol and fusel. I actually have to adjust a bit before next sip, and still needs some time to identify the different elements. Similar to the aroma there is some higher alcoholic references here, probably best described as Madeira or Sherry, maybe a hint of Brandy, but still different with an obvious fusel. Lots of dry fruit, particular raisins, prunes and apricot. Behind the strong alcoholic fumes there is very sweet malt, hint of oak, maple syrup and a decent bitterness. It was really fun experience to sample this beer, no doubt this is a great piece of art. I really dont know what I was expecting, but it didnt disappoint. I still cant have too much of this, but I will definitively try it again next tine the occasion will come.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
3030,"2010-01-23",4.8,"Ive had a lot more beers than my ratings show.  this beer was the greatest most intense 3 1/2 ounces ever. Figs, caramel, malt all get a blast from the crazy amount of alcohol. Beer will literally burn your lips. This stuff is amazing","Tampa, Florida, USA","sjolles85"
3030,"2010-01-20",3.6,"$200 per bottle, poured into a 4 oz. souvenir sampling glass: Volatile nose somewhere between brandy and whisky. My son describes it as rubber cement, but I digress. Cloudy viscous ochre pour, no head. No carbonation, thick and extra full bodied. The flavor is an absolutely delicious blend of honey, caramel, and cashews. The nuttiness stays from start to finish and assumes a more distinct pecan quality with time. I fully expected to hate this beer, particularly because of the cost, but it is actually very special. I dont like whiskey or other distilled spirits. I despise the bourbon barrel aging fad. Make no mistake this beer is more like a distilled spirit, but there are few liquors that I would rather have than this. Is it worth $200?  For most, I doubt it. For me, it was another tick, but a memorable and enjoyable one.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
3030,"2010-01-19",4.9,"""The bottle was divided seven ways, and was obtained by a friend on a recent trip to Texas (Utopias is outlawed in oHIo due to abv limits)....that being said I can honestly say the 3.5 ounce sample we each received offered immense amounts of enjoyment and fulfillment. True this is beer only due to the ingredients and methods produces, its a beautiful beverage 16 years in the making and provides aspects untouched by any other beer. Pours still as a winter night and has a chestnut/cherry colored body. No carbonation, no head, no lacing. Amazingly thick legs that creep down the glass when swirled. The body glistens when held to the light. Aroma instantly reminds me of Triple Bock only its Triple Bock cubed. Huge and hearty as I sniffed heavily and exhaled through my open mouth. Scents of plums, red wine, oak, tobacco, and cognac danced across my head. Overly sweet red fruits and layers upon layers of aroma. Viscous feel that coats the mouth. Extremely warming and luscuious. Full bodied is an understatement. The slightest of sips provided a euphoria that raced through my entire body. Sturdy flavors that resemble the incredible aroma. Sherry, port and common red table wine coupled with lots of overly ripe fruits. Vanilla, bourbon and tobacco are prevalent. This is insanely delectable, and the entire sample lasted me a couple of hours. Perhaps a once in a lifetime opportunity for this beer enthusiast. I was a little apprehensive about the cost/volume for my share...but that quickly went away after the initial sip. ""","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
3030,"2010-01-17",4.3,"I tried this beer back in 2007. I was working at village bottle shop and my manager broke the neck off one of the 4 bottles we had on accident. The break was perfect. None of the beer spilled and it didnt get into the beer. I poured the remaining into a nalgene bottle and saved it until I got home for a more proper tasting. I like this beer because they are pushing the envelope and just the idea of what beer is and can be. No head at all completely no carbonation. Lots of molasses and caramelized sugars. Alcohol presence heavy, very very warming. It would make for a nice beer to enjoy during the heart of winter with good friends.","Indiana, USA","tippebrewcrew2"

I was lucky to be the first person to try it there and as a result was the envy of the staff that looked forward to their shift ending so they could try it for themselves. It was with great anticipation that I watched the bartender pour the beer into a glass that can best be described as a midget mix of a brandy and i wine glass. The colour is dark golden with no head at all. The aroma is massive. Alcohol is of course the first thing you notice but theres also notes of oak, dark fruits and berries, caramel and vanilla as well. Brandy or aged sherry or port is perhaps a close comparison. The flavour is massivev and complex. Rich and full flavoured. Again the alcohol is the first thing you notice, but then a whole bunch of flavours appear. Oak, caramel, vanilla, syrup and cinnamon. The alcohol has a very warming effect and each sip can be savoured for several minutes at a time.","Kurland, NORWAY","espenra"

3030,"2010-01-02",4.1,"Vintage 2007. The bottle was opened for the first time about a year before I sampled it.

Shiny amber color, clear liquid. Obviously no head.

Lots of sweet fruit aromas (apples, plums, cherries), raisins, brandy. Notes of wood and a hint of dusty cellar. Big alcohol fumes, but they are well integrated and the smell is actually quite balanced. Very rich.

The flavor is intensely sweet with notes of fudge and toffee, chocolate, nuts and rich aromas of ripe fruit. Boozy raisins, brandy and barrel notes. The taste is richer than the smell and more complex. A faint cellar character is detectable, but not as clearly as in the smell. The finish is really hot with lots of spicy and sweet alcohol and lingering liqueur-like sweetness.

Great mouthfeel. Big body with a very sticky and chewy texture. Completely flat.

I liked this one. Of course, its more reminiscent of a fortified wine or liqueur than a regular beer, but thats how its supposed to be. A great sipper with a sophisticated yet cocky character.

Brown sugar, molasses, and banana predominated.  I couldnt place hops through the sweetness.  On the palate, the stuff is like syrup -- very thick and sticky.  Theres a lot of alcohol warmth and a bit of burn on the finish, but its by no means overpowering.  The flavor, sweet with dark sugars of molasses and maple, really covered it well.  I actually had low expectations for this, and I was pretty well blown away.  Absolutely terrific.","Overland Park, Kansas, USA","frizzzzle"

3030,"2009-10-06",4.2,"Nice full sample at the Wynkoop Rare Beer tasting during GABF 2009. Beautiful color-red/copper/gold. Nose of brandy, cognac, alcohol, and sweetness.

3030,"2009-09-30",4.4,"9/28/09 notes:  poured at 2009 GABF, to the tune of a LONG line.  But hell, if there is any beer you only need an ounce-and-a-half of to get a full rating, it would be this one!  Color is brown with red undertones and near-flat.  Utopias has one of the strongest and best aromas I have ever smelled in a beer:  rich dried fruit  figs, dates, raisins, apricot, banana  complemented by caramel and earthiness.  Flavor displays stiking sophistication, the described fruit components are all there, blended so thoroughly with vanilla-oak, aged wood, and caramel.  The finished product is also amazingly earthy, balanced and semi-sweet.  It may not be $100 good, but Utopias are certainly delicious.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

Dark burnt orangy brown and clean. Nice legs! Heavy duty aroma hits hard with the immediate dose of off-kilter Amaretto that has a stronger nutty quality than the almonds of said liquor, chocolate, some clean alcohol aroma comes through but its quite light considering where this beast weighs in at. Figs, toasted almonds, borderline soy sauce, sweet. After an hour this still did not open up beyond the early pour. The taste was pretty killer - toasted malts, I see the maderia but I still lean more towards a tawny port if I had to pick a liquor that I thought it may resemble. Sweet black licorice,  plums, raisins, smooth caramel, yum yum! Good alcohol spice, lots of English Barley Wine qualities here. Really quite smooth and soft - almost oily. Welcome chest burn is mild.

I had a small sample of this amazing beer. I know it was just a taste but I felt I needed to explain the experience.

The appearance was a dark gold/amber, no head and no carbonation. 

The smell was complex, many flavors blending together, the hints of dark chocolate, a little coffee bean aroma, some maple syrup flavor.

The taste was quite warm, since served at room temperature and also due to the high alcohol content. The taste had hints of chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, raisin, walnuts, peanut butter, and a few more I cant name.

Im sure this was not intended to consume in large amounts but a tasting was just the right amount. It went done smooth and just seemed to slide across the tongue.","Cumberland, Rhode Island, USA","Duhast500"

Poured a dark mahogany with slight ruby red elements, not cap or carbonation present what so ever. The alcoholic legs left behind after each pour are amazing. The aroma is awesomely complex, walnuts, rum, red wine, some sour notes, cherry, plums, hints of sour and rubber Im sure I could smell this for 3 straight hours and never get sick of it and always find something new. First sip both my face throat and stomach burn. There is so much alcohol but it is not as harsh as youd expect. Taste is awesome burnt sugar, liquorish, woody malts, apricots. My overall impression is sweet and smooth I think this would be great as a liquor during desert.

The shiney lustery metallic bottle was a nice start, felt like this was the prize of the Far East or something. The Magi brought this by, I suppose. The pour is red brown with no head, tons of purty fingers continually running down the Chimay glass edges as the super potent alcohol condenses and just puts on a great show. The aroma was strong alcohol, a bit like cocoa cognac, some brandy elements.  The flavor was shockingly smooth, smoother by far than anything cognac like, light chocolate, caramel, sweet dark fruits, molasses, maple, honey faintly resembling a sweet mead, yet this thing was highly drinkable, coulda got completely plastered all by myself. Towards the end of the glass, unmistakeable oaky notes noted along with some nuttiness. Each sip coulda gone on forever revealing new experiences.

Instead, she coats the sides of the glass in a thin film of luxurious alcohol, aka legs. That is fine with me for it leaves no barrier for her rich and decadent nose to reach mine. Wave after wave of brown sugars fresh and caramelized, toffee, maple, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla and warm spiced brandy notes secure their hold on my heart. My breath catches in my chest and my heart beats fast in my throat. With trembling fingers, I raise the snifter to my lips and we meet in a sweetly warm, sticky kiss.


Very few beers have reached the heights of nirvana as Sam Adams Utopias just has. That isnt to say she wont be topped by another, but such a divine supping experience belies her true nature: beer. Almost immediately alcohol nips at the tip of my tongue while a warm breath of maple, vanilla, and brown sugars linger beyond our initial embrace. Adding further complexity to her palate are warm spiced fruits such as nectarines and apricots. As my mouth waters, a sweet honey film clings to my cheeks and tongue while euphoric warmth slowly pervades the rest of my being. Some nutmeg creeps into her palate, mingling perfectly with the sweet sugars, warm brown spices, and brandy notes. Far too soon our love affair must come to a close as I gaze smitten at my empty snifter.

Smelled of booze (sorry, but it was there - 27%?  hells ya!), but also lightly sweet nuttiness, floral bitterness, hints of fruit, chocolate - quite sweet, another one that reminded me of an aged mead, in a good way ... my initial number for aroma was ""7"" but by the end of the sniffing I was up to ""9"" - so its entered as a compromise of ""8"".  The taste had all the same notes as the aroma, but more blended and complementary than I expected, truly complex and balanced - somewhat herbal, definitely honey/caramel sweet, alcoholic - reminded me a bit of pecan brittle candy.  Slick, sticky mouthfeel, light-bodied, definitely an alcohol dominance, but a fine, fine sipper - oddly, the finish was extremely quick.

2009-01-24. Dark amber brown body with a syrupy body that coats the glass. (3+) Sweetly alcoholic aroma is rather heady, touches of caramel sugars, hints of rubbing alcohol briefly, mild notes of raisins or dark fruits, muted florals. Fairly boozey. (7+) Flavour is hot on the lips, sweet sugary caramel, extremely muted malt subtlety. Rich sweetness and warming alcohol in the back pushes is way down the throat, but not before sending a wave of alcohol vapours up to the sinuses. (Now that is a first for me.) Smooth medium to fill bodied syrupy palate. Boozey alcohol is definitely prominent and omni-present but it backs off just a bit at the key moments to let the flavour come through in the middle. The alcohol works for it much better than I expected, but there are any number of barleywines  (albeit different) out there that are as satisfying at a much lower price point. Quite interesting, enjoyable in small quantities, radically overpriced.

Sweet woodiness, raisins, and a touch of nut in the aroma. Lovely smooth sweet vanilla-ey palate. Taste dominated by smooth raisin, vanilla, and gentle woodiness from the barrel ageing. Both the whisky and the port barrels are easy to spot. Delicious sipper, but not worth the price (15e/4cl).","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Bringing plum, vanilla and a caramel malt with it. Flavour is of course very strong.

This is definitely one of a handful of beers that stretches the limits of the beer world. We got quite a kick out of after unscrewing the top to find a beer cap inside. Did this remind me of port wine, yes to an extent, but with such a depth to it that I would take it over all of the ports I have ever had.

It involved something with girls swooning over you, free beer everywhere you go, and being able to rate a beer with 100% accuracy by just looking at the bottle.  Those haven’t happened yet, but I hope they will kick in by 2000 ratings.  1.5oz handbottle from iowaherkeye generously served about 6 people at  tasting at PP bottle shop.  I remember Sean savoring the 2mm in his glass (his second sample and the last from the bottle: the greedy bastard!) when someone said they didn’t get to try, so he offered a taste, frantically saying ""Don’t take too much!""  In all truth, I was the greediest with the most in my glass.  The smell is awesome.  Ryan said it smells the same as fresh despite the handbottle.  I guess you hope for that from a 27% flat beer.

So much going on here I love this stuff.  Flavor is much of the same with a huge booze component (again mostly bourbon) that works well with intense caramel, nuttiness and some raisin..

After having a few samples, I couldn’t get the oily, vanilla smell out of the plastic tasting cup for about half an hour and a few pours of acidic beers.  Pours a murky brown, no head.  Smells like a shot of bourbon with fruity whiskey oak and imitation vanilla very strong in the aroma.  Upon the first sip, I wrote ""strong ass"" in my notebook; I’m pretty sure I’m referring to the push of the body and alcohol, rather than any particular ass-like qualities in the beer.  Port sweetness and syrupy feel with grapes and brown sugar.  The finish is more syrupy than the middle as the beer leaves a film coating the mouth.  This is definitely an after-dinner sipper.

Then tried again another year later or more, it’s been a while since this last taste, but WOW it really is improving with bottle age. Alc maybe fading away?

Aroma is primarily made up of strong alcoholic note- something along the lines of a cognac, sherry, or fine port. Further notes of caramel malt and burboun. Flavor is quite intense- upon first sip I was all but knocked back by the copious alcohol presence, but it immediately subsided into a thick, rich flavor of caramel, ripe fruit, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, with a hint of an alcoholic burn. Suprisingly complex. Palate is extremely rich and thick- can only be described as some sort of syrup. Its slightly difficult to get by the blast of alcohol, but this beer is so rewarding once you do.

There wasnt any head, but Im pretty sure this was my first beer with legs. Rich aroma. Very boozy. The alcohol content was high enough that the fumes burned my nasal mucosa at first. After the flames subsided I smelled raisin and toffee accompanied by a melange of alcohols including port/sherry and bourbon. Sweet on the tongue with an alcohol burn that warmed the mucosal surfaces of my GI tract from mouth to stomach. Tasted as boozy as it smelled; akin to sherry or a fruity whiskey. There was also some maple, raisin, toffee, oak, and dark fruits. I liked this a lot, but be sure to share the bottle with a group of friends.

Flavors are excellent, exceptionally smooth especially considering the power of the nose. Shockingly clean and sippable, a true treat.2005 Is less refined than the 2003 and much hotter. Figs and aromatic spices come out more but so too does the alcohol, making it a less pleasant experience overall. 2007 is as smooth if not smoother than the 2003.

Poured a golden, reddish amber color, with no lacing at all and no head, obviously. Big peat in the aroma, like a port, with an alcoholic burn. Roasted elements are present, but mostly subdued. An interesting soy sauce characteristic, and while that may may seem like a deterrent for some, its not at all for me. Flavor is simply amazing. Rich caramel, brown sugar, a burning sweetness, its just simply delicious. This is unfairly drinkable. My mouth refuses to believe this is anywhere near 27%.

2 oz pour from my 2007 vintage bottle.  Pours a deep red with zero head and carbonation... Utopias is like a fine liquor that you keep on the shelf for special occasions... this stuff is pretty amazing... nothing like it in the world of beer.  Huge aroma full of alcohol, syrup, caramel, vanilla and sherry.  The initial taste on the palate is like an English Barley Wine... it is not as fierce as the aroma... more subtle on the palate.  Sweet malts, caramel and slight hops present themselves in a syrupy body.  As the beer makes its way down the throat, it becomes something completely different... huge alcohol presence that lasts a while down your entire throat.  Almost a burning sensation... the 25%+ abv is clearly defined in the finish.  Utopias is in a world by itself... it lives up to all the hype and uniqueness involved.

Aroma - incredibly, strongly, intensely alcoholic at first, changing to a warm, butter rum.  I couldnt keep my nose out of the Riedel.  Poured a dark, rich, ruby red with no head, carbonation, or lacing - normally a bad sign for a beer - but this is no ordinary beer.  Full-bodied and thick on the tongue, I sensed bread pudding, raisins, and almond oil.  A very complex and unique barleywine.  Too bad I didnt have a Cohiba to enjoy with it.

The sample pours out crystal clear amber with lots of legs along the edge of the glass and zero head. Wow, big big tasty aroma. Love it. It is sweet and yummy. A deep drag pulls up sweet rich creamy sticky caramel malty sweetness. I also get some opulent dark fruity esters with dates, grapes and perfectly ripe cherries. As the drag continues the phenols start to kick in and almost burnt the nose with alcohol. This is the thickest, richest, boldest and most alcoholic barleywine Ive ever experienced. The taste begins with a slick sweet nectar that slips in on its own. The taste is just rich and decadent. There is a rich creamy and bold caramelness that seems to happily dominate the flavor. Theres also lesser amounts of dark fruitiness way out in the background. Toward the finish the heat does build up a bit along with caramel mixed with almonds, chestnuts and filbert nuttiness. WOW!!!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3030,"2008-02-24",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2008 Degarth, Ibrew2or3 and I almost bought a bottle of this a while back but missed out on the chance. I feared I would never get to try it due to the rarity and price. Thankfully there are some ungodly generous people on this Earth. Sample from the extremely cool and generous owner of Oldsmar Tap House. All we did was comment on his bottles above, in passing, and next thing we know he was pouring us all a sample. The 3 of us have been pining after this beer for quite a while, so this was aa real treat. Looks like a fine liquor when poured out, no head at all, and a beautiful deep caramel color. Completely still in appearance, this one looks like its going to put a hurting on you. Nose is huge, sure there is tons of booze there, but that cant be helped, but behind that there is a large amount of tropical fruitiness, sweet nutty notes, caramel and toffee malts, some peat and some pungent perfumey type hop notes. The nuttiness, while apparent in the aroma, becomes a standout in the flavor profile. It makes this dangerously close to being too sweet and cloying, but I think the super high ABV cuts things enough and distracts your palette so its not a huge bother. Very viscous and substantial, this one coats your mouth and stays there for a long, long time. A perfect mouthfeel, wish I could give it higher than a 5. Tremendous amounts of phenol heat show up in each stage of this beer, but thanks to the small sample size, its manageable. A little dabll do ya with this one. Finish is lengthy, hot, nutty, malty, rich and decadent. Thanks, Tony!","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

Aroma of alcohol, butterscotch, and maple candy.  Flavor is sweet with maple syrup, french toast and almonds.  Still body is a bit of a surprise but appropriate I suppose given the nature of the drink, though makes it feel more like an additive than something that is supposed to be consumed alone.  I would like to pour this on a breakfast offering, as I imagine it would go well.  I would rather drink syrup than soy sauce, though, so I would call this creation more successful than the triple bock.  Pretty well done, but not with any degree of craftsmanship that would merit a price within the same time zone as what this beer sells for.  To me, this beer still represents BBC trying to hose the beer community because its a well known brewery, but at least its a good drink.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
3030,"2008-01-26",4.5,"It was pretty surprising to see Utopias on my local bars beer menu. I was a bit hesitant to try another Sam Adams strong ale after trying the Triple Bock and finding it to be a mess of flavors that didnt belong together. However a sample of Utopias isnt something you come across everyday. The rarity and uniqueness of this brew pushed me over the edge, and past the price too.

2 ounce pour for $15 (!) at The Red in Santa Cruz. The bartender poured it into a kind of undersized champagne flute that I found to be very appropriate for the beer. It poured a deep amber that seemed to glow with light, as though by camera trick or special effects from a commercial. Very viscous for a beer, it left long thin legs down the glass after swirling. No head, no carbonation.

Aroma is primarily sweet molasses and caramel, with a distinct vanilla note. The booze manifests as a particularly oaky bourbon note.

Taste is a whirlwind of sweet and hot flavors. Chocolate, vanilla, and caramel wash over the tongue amidst exquisitely smooth booziness. Finish is buttery, almost butterscotchy. Obviously portlike although less fruity.

Mouthfeel is very thick but smooth. The alcohol blends with the sweet flavors seamlessly. The finish lingers for a long time, lending companionship to the slowly evolving warmth in the chest.

Considering the alcohol level, this is very very drinkable, but only by way of sipping. Id love to have a bottle of this so I could pour a significant helping into a snifter and just slowly revel in the sweetness and warmth on a cold winter night.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Alcohol is immediately noticeable and domiating, but  yields to some port and brandy vinous maturity, that combine with some bubblegum esters and sugar syrup. After these rough edges, a good lot of caramel, toast, and good earth show. Then a nip of dust and oxidation. Finally, only the faintest hop smithers come through.

The amount I poured for myself was only the size of a shot glass since the aroma was so strong in alcohol and I knew before hand the ABV level. The nose is so similar to hard liquor such as whiskey, scotch or rum that I didnt have that much pleasure taking sniffs of it. Anyway, I detected scents of sugar, maple syrup, and soy sauce almost to the same effect the triple bock had played on me. Upon my initial first sip I honestly admit I winced and told myself this is was not beer. The aftertaste was of sweet sugary malts that were undeniable that this truly was a beer and I should give it another sip. The flavor is so sweet that it completely overwhelms all signs of other flavor. Although, I do get the hint of the slightest touch saltiness and bitterness in the faint background. An easy way to describe this beer is maple syrup raised to another degree of intensity, but also this beer is very similar to a whiskeyI just had to say it again. To strong for my blood and thats why Im pouring shot glasses for close friends for them to try despite the price tag.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Is a dark, murky brown color with no carbonation and no head whatsoever, but with this high of alcohol I cannot punish it for that. Smell is of candy, burnt sugar, vanilla, and alcohol is noticeable (not surprisingly) in the nose. Taste is very strong, burnt sugar, maple syrup, vanilla, and an alcohol is present but does not over power you as one might expect. Mouthfeel is thick an syrup-like with no carbonation, very smooth.

3030,"2007-11-21",3.9,"Consumed in a Sam Adams Reidel glass.  I had an old rating stored here, but I deleted it as it was from a small sample from their first batch of this beer.  Pours light brown with no head.  A nice neck, like you might see from a cognac or good scotch shows itself on the glass as the beer is swirled.  Smells of sherry, cognac, warming alcohol, citrus, some woody character.  Taste is sweet with molasses, some hints of sherry, maple, lots of warming alcohol, but it doesnt overwhelm the other flavors.  Some cherry notes are also present.  Mouthfeel yields lots of alcohol as does the finish.  If you take this for what it is, which is a fermented cordial, it is actually quite interesting and different.  Reminds me of a cognac.  This ""beer"" could really benefit from some aging in a barrel.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3030,"2007-11-21",3.4,"$20 for a 1oz sample at Hop Devil. Not worth it. Not even close. Hot, full, rich aroma. Nutty sugars, milk chocolate, beets. Big alcohol. Filling, nutty flavor, very malty. Wheaty and husky flavors develop as the beer sits and become overbearing and off-balance. Very boozy, brash... almost tastes a bit off. I can see some hints of Tripelbock in here but it is nowhere near as beautifully crafted or aged as that.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
3030,"2007-11-20",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2007 Special Utopias tasting at Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. There is a story behind every beer, and a story behind every beer drank. This beer rivals the Greek epics, the Great Russian Ballets, and the many wonders of the world. I waited with anticipation for the night to arrive, having cleared my work schedule and getting the mother in law to watch the boy. I arrived at the location and awaited with a palpable anticipation for the opening of the bottle. It was opened and poured into the glass, looking like the nectar of the beer gods. A beautiful sunset amber. Although there was no frothy covering on this mountain, it was sheer elegence in its naked beauty. The aroma was breathtaking. A perfect blending of fragances each peeking through to culminate in a scent all its own. The feeling of familiarity in the scent, like a gathering of all your family and closest friends, but with the freshness of a newborn babe. Butterscotch, vanilla, fruits, hops, caramel, toffee to name a few. After relishing the bouquet for what seemed a fleeting moment, but turned out to be a few minutes, I took my first sip. Ecstacy, rapture, utter fantasy and delight. The tastes of the best breakfast pancakes with maple syrup, along with a beautiful butterscoth toffee, and a great glowing warmth of alcohol. As I rolled it around on my tongue, every taste bud was alive with sensory input, no one thing overpowering the other.  The warm, luxuriant, silky liquid felt as though it was melting on my tongue. The finihing touches bring a dearth of warmth,  happiness and fullfilment. If beer was an emotion, this would be love. If I never again sample another beer, at least I have tasted the nectar of bliss.","Watertown, Wisconsin, USA","ubamartian"

Awesome viscosity tears inside the glass. For aroma, each time I could pick up a different scent. First, its maple syrup, then its sweet dark raisins, then its dark chocolate with coconut, then its sweet bourbon. Careful not to take in the aroma too hard. The alcohol will sting your nose. Talk about multi-personality, I can see sitting in front of a fireplace just to savor the sweet scents of this beverage. Taste is thick and syrupy with flavors of sweet creamy bourbon, coconut, a touch a raisin, toffee and caramel. Finish is quite warm from the high alcohol, smooth, creamy with a soft raisin and bourbon aftertaste. This is the most rich flavored barley wine Ive encountered.

This was truly amazing.  My coworker noted that shed never seen me like this and the look on my face was what she imagined hers looked like when confronted with a truly spectacular wine.  The aroma was worth savoring for a full 20 minutes before delving in.  Sweet caramel perfectly blended with vanilla and dark pitted fruits.  As with most barley wines, I feared a cloying aroma and taste when so young.  Twas not the case here.  The still mahogany body revealed no such defect.  In fact the smooth body was perfectly balanced.  Just enough sweetness to remind me of the style but a pronounced maple flavor captivated my taste buds.

Aroma is very alcoholic but complex and approachable... almost like Balvenie whisky mixed with a tokay or muscat- vanilla, wood, raisin, plum, pepper.  Spicy alcohol in the mouth.  Good malt sweetness, velvety mouthfeel with the lack of carbonation. Bitterness is difficult to detect at this level of alcohol and with all the luscious swetness.  I had about 20mls worth - I wouldnt want a lot more, unless it was the last drink of the day.  I had an Emersons Bookbinder after this and it tasted like carbonated water for the first few sips.

3030,"2007-02-04",3.9,"Bottle, 2005 vintage (Sydney Summer Gathering 2007): Let me begin by saying that I came to this glass with absolutely no preconcetions about this beer. I didnt even know the style or the intention. Presenting as a very dark gold with no head, I thought it likely to be a barley wine. However, as I drank in the heady aromas I was astounded. For some time I have imagined the ways that beer can match the high points that the wine industry, through its sheer size, can support. Here, I was presented with not only an equal, but a challenger to the great digestives and aperitifs of the world. Reading some ratings I see that year to year this changes, but in terms of the 2005 what we have is a world class drink. Spiritous cognac-like aroma that derives character from some smokey caramels. Very sweet in the mouth, with some sharp alcohol notes amid symphonies of stickyness. There is no doubt in my mind that this would be absolutely brilliant as a digestif. Outstanding.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Aarleks"

Viscous, yet volatile palate, fully covers the mouth. Hot, sweet, some vanilla flavour, dried fruits, like raisins and figs, but unfortunately a slightly papery oxidised element intrudes into the flavour, somewhat diminishing the experience.

The alcohol smell is overwhelming as is the rich scotch nose and carmel nose. Surprisingly the beer is not that hot for as large as it is. But that really is not enough to save the beer. The flavor mimmicks the aroma. I ended up giving most of my sample to a friend that did enjoy the beer.

3030,"2006-08-14",4.5,"Limited 2005 Edition. Bottle #00732. 24oz. Beautiful bronze/copper brew kettle bottle. Easily the most stunning bottle Ive ever seen..downright impressive just to look at. Sam Adams signature engraved on the front, and on the back, copper sliding doors that reveal a picture of Samuel Adams. Bottom of the bottle is individually numbered in gold lettering.

Strongest beer in the world? Sure, its somewhat of a gimmick, but I still had to try it. Saw it at Johns Grocery in Iowa City and took the only two bottles they had.

Served right around 60 degrees..let it warm to room temp as we drank it.

Pours a clear bronze/amber color..looks very much like cognac or whiskey. No head, lace, or carbonation, but it holds to the glass like syrup..very sticky consistency. Aroma is surprisingly alcoholic..smells stronger than many 40-50% liquors Ive had...wow. Sweet smells of brown sugar and almost has a tequila-like quality to it. Interesting..

Tastes are incredible..very sweet & rich..dark fruits, brown sugar, smoky malts, oak, vanilla, molasses, cinnamon, raisins, maple syrup....with a slight burning alcohol finish. Hop character is subdued by the huge malty tastes and alcohol bite. Very warming and has a wonderful complexity to it.

Overall, Id say the 24 ounces probably isnt ""worth"" the $100+ price tag, but then again, what could be worth that? Whats gold going for an ounce these days? Other great high-alcohol beers such as DFH World Wide Stout and DFH 120 Minute IPA are less than $10 per 12oz bottle, and are around 20%. You cant get much more unique, though..and it was nice to get the chance to try it. Goes down remarkably smooth and is surprisingly drinkable as well..the tastes linger on the tongue, and as soon as they fade, you find yourself yearning for another sip.

If you have money burning a hole in your pocket and can find this great brew, Id say go for it. You can always split the cost with a few friends like I did. That way you wont feel so guilty when youre staring at the gorgeous empty bottle.","Iowa, USA","hero27"

Sampled again at the EBF NOTB on 2/15/08. Aged with Cacao nibs. Poured hazy reddish-brown without carbonation.

Pretty much all hard liquer strength alcohol in the plum/raison barleywine way.  Think Thomas Hardys to the tenth degree.  Taste is too strong, all alcohol, ridiculous burn in the throat.

3030,"2006-05-08",4.5,"The Sam Adams Utopia marked the 100th review for us here at 2beerguys.com, and we were very honored to share the experience with our friends and family. Oddly enough for our beer site, the Utopia has almost no beer characteristics whatsoever. It is indeed, as Samuel Adams has said, that this is a beer brewed to show people the other end of the beer spectrum, to show what a beer can be. The presentation alone is enough to let you know well in advance that you are in for an experience. We did not know what to expect when we popped the top on the bottle, and were very pleased with the blast of vanilla that immediately permeated the air around us. As it is a non-carbonated beer, the visual qualities of course included a still body, as it pours a medium amber color. No head and no lacing, although Wood noted that it has nice legs. Some of the reaction we got to the aromas were of sherry, caskwood, alcohol, and almond. Of course, vanilla has already been noted. I dont think there was a person there that wasnt surprised when they took their first sip. A heavy hit of sweet on the initial taste, but instead of hops or malts, we got the same qualities we expect from a cognac or tawny port. The finish was hot, with a coating like a bourbon, a little burn follows it down. Ian got a taste of sugar free maple syrup. Mouthfeel gave a medium body with a creamy texture, with a light alcohol finish. Although I can not say this was the best beer weve reviewed thus far, because it lacks so many of the beer characteristics that we treasure, it does, by far, outscore those we have reviewed before because of its incredible stylings and unexpected nuances not expected from a beer. Well done Samuel Adams, well done.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","2beerguys"

The nose of this beer is amazingly complex and aromatic with just layers of aromas. Cinnamon, oak, vanilla, walnut, black pepper, sweet malt, sherry, maple, and peppery alcohol heat flood the nostrils. The palate is rich and slightly syrupy on the tounge, with layers of flavors. Complex notes of oak, sherry, whiskey, sweet malt, vanilla, maple, and walnut flavors fill the mouth. Utopias MMII finishes with more of those complex flavors, and ends with a very warming, soothing, high octane burn. 

This is an amazing beer drinking experience, akin to drinking a fine single malt scotch or cognac. This is the ultimate sipping brew, the perfect beer to have after a big meal, and the perfect beer to slowly sip and savor on a special occasion. I was very impressed with this beer, and I will slowly work on my bottle, partaking only on special occasions. For with a beer this special, comes a lofty price tag.

The aroma is heavily malty with caramel, molasses, roasted grain and chocolate and moderately yeasty with notes of barnyard and dough. Plenty of miscellaneous aromas of wood, honey, candy sugar, raisin, cognac and brandy. The flavor is plenty hot, but I wouldnt guess 25%. Its pretty well hidden. It begins heavily sweet and lightly bitter with a long, heavily sweet, moderately bitter candy-like finish. The body is full, the texture is syrupy and the carbonation is flat.

3030,"2005-12-19",3.8,"Pours a clear, ruby amber color.  The aroma is quite pronounced and concentrated with notes of brandy, concentrated malt almost extract light notes.  There is lots of hot alcohol fumes, but it is not so much that it dominates the other aromatics, in fact it is in a pretty good balance with the concentrated malt notes.  This really does smell like a brandy, or a scotch or perhaps a bourbon, I cant really say, but it does have a sticky sweet note that is not really found in any of these.

The taste is sweet, but not overly so and has a concentrated maltiness to it.  There are also flavor notes reminiscent of molasses and maple syrup here.  The finish, at times, is dominated by hot alcohol notes that make the finish reminiscent of rum.  Actually the more I think of it, the more apt the rum analogy is; there are lots of molasses and fermented cane flavor type notes here.  The flavors are so concentrated that they are almost overwhelming, some of the notes I cant seem to pick out.  I do get notes of vanilla, lots of caramel, and toffee brittle.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I was the first in line for this thing and they gave me a 4-5oz pour, it ended up being way too much. Reddish brown color with no carbonation, laces like crazy. Aroma is heavy on bourbon/whiskey. Maybe a touch of the sweet maple syrup in the nose. The taste is sweet maple syrup initially; in fact, really good maple syrup, lots of depth in the natural maple flavors. The whiskey/bourbon is lurking in the background. There is some milk chocolate and astringent oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and buttery with a fiery, alcoholic end. Too much alcohol. Worth a try, but more than a couple ounces gets to be a bit much.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Brandy and port wine were prominent, with undertones of caramel, heavy dark fruits, maple, and some noble/floral hoppage... I also found whiskey and oak in there.  Sticky-sweet on the palate, with alcohol power throughout.

The ABV is evident from the first splash upon the lips, and it lingers throughout the experience.  (Notice I said it is an ""experience,"" as this is one beer that will keep you occupied for awhile, and leave you with some lasting memories.)  More akin to a good cognac than a beer, with its biting spice flavor of take-your-pick spices.  Hints of fermented raisin abound in the finish.

In the end I have to call it a real disappointment ... for the price you can get a GREAT scotch ... or half a case of Dogfish Head World Wide, or even half a case of Westvleteren.

A terribly thick amber/orange with no head, Utopias gave the initial impressions of brandy or scotch. Aromas (that could kill a cow) were total brandy with oak, cherry and bakery.

There was a big nuttiness to finish & linger... pecans with honey and brown sugar. Full-bodied and syrupy. This baby actually made me sweat. Not so much a beer as something much, much more.

In smaller amounts the alcohol and the sweetness are more contained, though its still pretty sickeningly sweet. Maple, caramel, and oak are the most pronounced flavors, with alcohol coming in at the end to mop everything up. Overall, like a very sweet rum mixed with cognac and fortified wine.

3030,"2005-08-14",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2005 Sampled at the Great Taste of the Midwest, Madison, 8/13/2005. I have to thank my wife for this one, she waited in line at the Sam Adams tent while I waited for Raspberry Eisbock at the Kuhnhenn tent. This to me is the most puzzling beer that one can rate, because at this point, it didnt taste much like beer to me any longer. Other high alcohol beers I have sampled such as Dogfish 120 and Barley Johns Barrel-Aged Rosies Ale still tasted of beer to me. This reminded me of Scotch more than anything else, but Scotch after one adds a bit of water. The Scotch alcohol burn wasnt there in the least. But lots of butter, toffee, and vanilla on the palate. This is an experience more than anything, and in that sense, if you can get 25 friends together, its probably worth 5 bucks each. Revised after a more extensive sampling at the Festival of Barrel Aged Beers. I like this stuff more each time I have (the third time now) perhaps because Im prepared for the fact that it is more akin to hard liquor than beer.

Pours a rich auburn with zero carbonation, zero head. I would describe this beer as having ""nice legs"" like a wine or port. Smells of sherry. I have heard it compared to cognac but I have no frame of reference there. Vanilla, oak, alcohol, and bright caramel and molasses all intermingle in the nose.

Sherry is the flavor that dominates here but lets break it down a little. Roasty caramel, vanilla, hints of black currant and oak. Alcohol is a bit pronounced but not as much as I would have expected. This beer is refined and sophisticated, not rough. Lightly sticky in the mouth with a dry finish.

3030,"2005-07-27",5.0,"Part of the cost of this beer can be attributed to the artistic 24-ounce bottle in which it is packaged. The copper-finished ceramic bottle was designed to look like a brew kettle, although it also resembles a command module from the U.S. space program in the Apollo era. A sliding door on the bottle reveals a portrait of brewer-patriot Samuel Adams. Five kinds of malt  including two German smoked malts  are used and all four varieties of the ""noble hops,"" three Germans  Hallertauer Mittelfrueh, Spalt and Tettnanger  plus the spicy Czech Saaz. 
Several different yeasts are used, including champagne yeast, which is able to handle higher alcohol content. 
The beer is then aged for more than a year in Scotch, cognac and port barrels. Utopias appearance and taste is more that of a sherry than beer. There is no carbonation, thus no head. The amber-colored liquor gives off a warm, complex aroma with more than a hint of alcohol. My first sensation was a strong vanilla flavor backed by a subtle spiciness that I couldnt identify. Cinnamon, perhaps. And then, yeehaw, a warm, smoky glow of alcohol, not unlike you would find in a single malt scotch.","ENGLAND","CarpexxxDiem"

Needless to say, I could tell this was not the brew for me.  There was quite a bit of alcohol and bready yeast in the aroma as well.  The flavor matches up exactly.  I can hardly get past the maple flavor to drink it, but behind that, theres plenty of alcohol in this self-proclaimed ""strongest beer in history"" (Hair of the Dog Dave ring a bell, anyone?).

The Festivities:This isnt beer, its hard liquor and pancake syrup. Alcohol is everywhere, lingers and coats the palate. Perchance, earthy caramel and fruitiness can be found, redolent of some of their Triple Bock attempts, but that burning splash of ethanol I endure every sip of it is not very pleasurable.

Thick looking, with no head, but plenty of haziness.  A touch of white lace on the edges of the glass. Aroma, not surprisingly, was filled with a mix of intoxicating spirits.  Brandy, cognac, dark rum, bourbon (of course) and add oak to all of this.  Difficult to identify as beer, by the aroma, but perhaps some traces of sweet caramel.  Flavor is immediately full of coconut, unrefined cane sugar, molasses, oak and a hint of yeast.  Highly burning sensation from the alcohol begins midway through and climaxes on the finish.  Some sticky caramel malt notes, and enough body from the malt to identify this as beer, but its borderline.  Syrupy sweetness present to some degree, as the alcohol runs rampant. . . . .  On the plus side, the hops arent overdone and the consistency was pretty agreeable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The color and aroma are very Scotch/Cognac like, basically a very oaky liquor, but this had a hint of malt sweetness in it.  The flavor was that of a very smooth blended scotch, again with just a touch of sweetness in the finish, with notes of butterscotch and toffee.

Color is a lightly hazy dark honey, amber and red outlines.  No head at all.  Dust floating in the slightly oily, silky, and viscous body-- foreboding flecks of unfermentables.  Awesome legs dribble down the side of the glass.  Aroma is strongly alcoholic with sharp port, sherry, and maple; subtle pecan-- kick the ass with its alcohol.  Deep butter cognac and caramels.  Its a shame, but theres just too much damn alcohol on this beast for me (and thats saying a lot).  It could be unreal, but its too harsh right now. Lets give it 25 years!  Flavor still brings some harsh burn of alcohol, but I dont mind it so much in the mouth-- I just dont like it burning my sinuses in the odor.  Wood barrel assault; surprisingly subdued flavors at first that then just explode in the mouth.  Just wonderful to behold what this beer can do (and do to you-- I bet a hangover from this beast would kill an ox).  Finish is terrifically long, caramellized nut, pecan and walnuts; prickly raw wood and a bit of brown sugar stickiness.  Glowing and wonderfully warming.  Id love to try this baadasssss when the alcohol has rounded out a bit (ok, a lot!)-- give it the Jadwiga 25-year treatment and call me when its ready.  Still pretty awesome.

All you need for beer is some fermented grain...add a little yeast and your’re there.  You don’t even need to add hops----but that’s a very bad idea.  It kinda reminds me of a cross between Grand Marnier, a fine port, and a nice sipping rum.  I like the brandy-like aroma.  The taste yields maple and vanilla flavors.  Very alcoholic...seems more than 25%.  I’ve got several bottles.  If I compare the two I’ve opened the big difference was the color.  One was definitely lighter copper-red.  The body is very thick.

The flavor is a mélange of port, sherry, buttery caramel and boozy brandy. Sweet, hot finish. Nearly unbelievable that the foundation of this is malted barley. World class all the way! Thanks go out to otakuden for her generosity!

****Original rating**** Bottle #06757 (05)...  Crystal clear, copper/amber ale with no head. Smells very much like dark sherry or port. Notes of vanilla, oak, dried plum and alcohol. The flavor pretty much matches the aroma. Its also meaty and a bit heavier in alcohol. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. Lengthy, alcoholic/dry finish. The ultra high ABV is well-disguised, but not entirely hidden. Then again, completely hiding an ABV of 25% within a bottle of beer would be like trying to hide an elephant behind a single tree. Oh, and did I mention this stuff is pretty darn spendy? Thanks to Argo0 for the sample! (Original Score = 3.8)","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

3030,"2004-02-08",3.8,"Massive, powerful and complex aroma, with characteristics of toffee and caramel, butterscotch, maple and brown sugar, vanilla, faint herbs and dark fruits and quite a bit of fiery, peppery alcohol.  To me, very reminiscent of single malt scotch.  Brilliant, light-medium clear copper color, still and coating the glass thickly.  No head or lacing to speak of.  Extremely flavorful.  Hot and alcoholic, with a darkly sugary counterpoint.  Some faint woodiness to be found late.  Thickly smooth and considerably warming mouthfeel.  What a unique creation.  I sniffed this for a good twenty minutes before  giving it a taste.  Agree that this is totally outside any experience with beer I've had to date.

I noticed some chocolate and liquor notes in the taste and the alcohol was very present but not too intrusive.

Thick, fierce palate and soft as a feather. Completely devoid of carbonation. Toasty, figgy sweetness sweet up front, followed by an herbal, tobacco, alcohol blend. Perfect level of acidity to catch up with the sweetness. Sharp alcoholic core with tingly apple skin and sherry notes. Warms the innards as it goes down the shoot.

This is the one beer I was almost afraid to drink.  $90 a bottle, and 25% abv was enough to rattle me a bit.  Again, in a snifTer.  Head was one after a second or two.  The apperance was like apple cider, getting darker from top to bottom.   Smelled this one for a looong time.  The first and most lasting impression of the aroma was tequilla, and then add in some vanila.  There was so much more I just could not pick out.  I balked twice at taking the frist sip.

Upon opening the bottle it hits you then you pour it and get an even stronger whiff of it, then you stick your nose in it and get hit by the battering ram!  Boom your sense of smell is gone!  Which way did the freight train go?  Strong elements of alcohol like tequila mixed with vanila extract mess up your nose.  Then you sit back in amazement at this brew.  The body is a transparent copper color with medium sized quickly disppearing white colored bubbles.  The mouthfeel is very smooth on the tongue then you swallow and BURRRRRRNNNNNN!  WOW!!!! What a feeling!  It has a strong cogniac flavor mixed with sherry and alcohol esthers.  This is like no other beer and in its own class.

Flavor was sweet with vanilla and maple syrup dominating the palate.  Heavy alcohol too.  Each swallow brought a quick chase of water (like I said, I'm not a liquor fan).

Additionally, detected a large vanilla extract, ruby port, maple syrup, and earthy yeast ester. Almost harsh in it's treatment of my palate as well. Strong alcohol burn on lips and through to the chest. Very sticky sweet and syrupy. It brought back memories of the EKU28 I was forced to drink as an 18 year old airman in Germany. Not very nice.

What springs forth is initially very sweet and dessert like, but as the syrupy full bodied beer sits but a few moments longer it releases the maple, vanilla bean, toffee, and caramel.

The first sip clearly reveals the powerful alcohol, not so much in the flavor but because it made my whole mouth numb.  Then there are some nice woody, nutty (hazlenut), raisin, vanilla and caramel veins.

3030,"2003-02-02",4.3,"Woody aroma, high alcohol is certainly noticed. Melted caramel/butterscotch in colour, dead still. Incredibly strong single malt taste, some wood notes. Wonderful mouthfeel, smooth. A huge tasty Barley Wine!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
3030,"2003-01-30",4.3,"Tasted alongside Triple Bock and Millennium. Reddish-amber colour with no head or carbonation. Aroma and mouthfeel of a sweet bourbon. Flavours of maple, butterscotch, vanilla and raisin. A bit of its beer pedigree can be sensed in the slightly malty finish, but it's more like a bourbon than anything else. Not quite as complex or balanced as the Millennium, but I imagine it will be outstanding in a couple of years.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
3030,"2002-10-16",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2004 Cask GABF 02:  First of all let me mention that I hate Sam Adams Triple Bock.  Huge maple, port, alcohol, vanilla, and tobacco nose.  Deep orange color, full bodied, but totally flat.  Starts very sweet and ends that way.  I had around 7 samples of this over 3 days and was amazed at how complex it is. The flavor explodes in your mouth and then slightly burns on the way down. Although nowhere near how you would expect 24% to burn.  Overpriced?  Yes!  But it shows a new direction that beer can head in and hopefully something like it can be produced for under the $100 list price of a bottle. Rating #1000 for me and the winner of the Volgon Best of GABF 2002 award.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
3030,"2002-10-12",4.3,"WOW!!!  This is a wonderful rich and flavorful beer.  Made for an drab or two on a cold winter night.  Saved me from opening my bottle. GABF 2002","McKinleyville, California, USA","gwfrankpsu"
3030,"2002-10-10",3.9,"GABF 2002: Amber colour, still (no head).  Intense!!!!! Aroma of fruitcake, vanilla, various spices.  Extra warming, extra caramel, extra everything.  Its like a supercharged Samiclaus.  This beer is perhaps a bit too much, but is indeed interesting.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
3030,"2002-10-08",2.3,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2003 UPDATED RATING: After being able to taste more than a one ounce sample, I had to lower my rating (and also since I could compare this to WWS 23%).  This just ain't beer.  It smells like Jack Daniels and tasted like sherry (I hate sherry).  WWS tastes like beer.  This does not.  It's disgusting.  Sam Adams should quit making strong beers, the Triple Bock is bad and so is this.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
3030,"2002-10-07",4.4,"GABF 2002: A real treat.  Hazy dark amber color, with a small head.  Rich raisiny brandy aroma.  Strong alcoholic presence in the nose.  Strong and sweet flavor, but not at all cloying.  Full syrupy body covers the whole palate with strong sweet fruity raisiny and alcoholic notes.  Nice lingering sweetness is lip-smacking good.  Some maple and molasses notes.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
3030,"2002-10-06",3.6,"The smell of whiskey encompasses your nose from many feet away. At first, it tasted similar to whiskey, but with a beerish finish. Super smooth, with a lip-burning alcoholic bite. At almost 50 proof, this stuff is whopping! After the alcohol passes, there is a big, chewy maple-sweetness that is woodsy in nature. Not like any alcoholic beverage Ive had before. While it originates from a beer road, it is definitely taking the road less travelled. Difficult to rate because there is little to compare with. Not to mention, stylistically, its off the charts. Cost aside, I might prefer it to straight Jim or Jack though, if that tells you anything.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3030,"2002-08-21",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2003 Thick, copper colour. Dark in the middle lightens to the periphery. Absolutely no head with little to no carbonation and a slight suspention (sugar?). Malty, burnt caramel fruity (dates?, raisins?) nose. Thick, syrupy feel that lingers on the tongue. Taste: Quite complex. Thickly sweet w/ caramel,  brown sugar, vanilla, and nut flavours with hints  (I think) of dates and raisins. Warm and dry, lingering malty, creamy middle. Little to no bitterness but a nice spicy finish. A nicely balanced beer. 

Don't know if I could bring myself to pay $100 for a bottle (bought it by the ounce at the Mondial in Montreal), but it was worth trying.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
3030,"2002-07-16",4.6,"I could smell this beer a few feets from the bottle when it was opened. Very strong taste... made me think of a porto. Taste of hazelnuts and caramel. I recomend tasting it instead of buying it if you have the chance to, because its price is very high.","Quebec, CANADA","spaque99"
3030,"2002-07-07",3.9,"Amber with absolutely no head or effervesence.  Strong alcohol and toffe aroma.  Oily mouthfeel, brown sugar and vanilla come to mind.  A bit similar to a mild scotch but sweeter and with less wooden notes.  An evening beer.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"
3030,"2002-04-11",4.3,"The first taste is strong. After the Utopias settles in your mouth you are overcome with a very sweet taste.  The after taste is strong, but good.  Very strong smell, almost like a Whiskey, or Port.  I would recomend it to anyone who could find one to drink, or afford it.","White Bear Lake, Minnesota, USA","Carman42099"

3030,"2002-03-07",4.0,"Hold the glass at a distance from your nose, and the aroma of maple sugars engrosses the senses. As the glass is brought closer to the nose the alcohol becomes quite evident, reminescent of an old rum. As the elixir tips the tounge the sugars introduce themselves briefly, giving way to to the ever so emiment strength of the brew. Rolling to the middle of the tounge the taste of cane sugars emerge while still allowing the full flavors of maple to develop. As it hits the top of the mouth, the alcohol is still reminding you of the extra-ordinary strength of the brew. Rolling down the throat, the alcohol dispersses leaving in the mouth a syrupy sweetness, reminding one of eating waffles on a cold winter morn. Surely this was how the Europeans felt when they first tasted the sugary rums coming from the carribean.","USA","scottdaughaday99"
