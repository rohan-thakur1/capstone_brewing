690,"2011-02-27",3.9,"Growler via trade with tytoanderso awhile back - Pours a clear deep reddish-brown color with a small light tan head.  Faint lacing.  Aroma is mostly bourbon and light malt.  Flavor is sweet toasted malt and oak/bourbon.  Medium body.  A good beer.  Thanks Tyler.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
690,"2010-12-06",4.2,"From Notes.  Growler to stein.  Polished off in a sitting with a good friend.  A very tasty brew.  Aroma is nice malt, with the honey from the BA more assertive than I would have thought.  Flavor is much the same...only better.  Great mouthfeel, very creamy.  Dont get a ton of ""wood"" character here, which is my only complaint.  But an awesome, awesome beer.","California, USA","LamarBurton"
690,"2010-10-29",4.0,"Pours a dark brown with a slight red tinge. Nice 1 finger bead. Malty, Biscuity, sweet aroma with a touch of vanilla and alcohol. Medium mouthfeel. Peaty, smokey, sweet dark fruit and honey flavors abound in the taste. Pretty sweet but in a good way. Apples flavors as well. Scottish/Irish whiskey notes. Sweet honey with smokey finish.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
690,"2010-10-14",3.4,"growler thanks to pantanap!  Lovely lightly murky glowing brown red with a small fizzy head.  Great scotch yeast aroma, lightly fruity, touch of glue? (not sure thats what I wrote), phenol, touch of smoke.  Sweet fruity first taste but quickly turns to a nice beechwood like jerky smokiness, odd, weird play of sweet and smoke.  Medium bodied, syrupy with light carbonation.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
690,"2010-08-04",3.6,"Growler shared by theisti, thanks Tim.  Color is dark brown with a small head.  Aroma is strong with a stingy alcohol. Some stickiness from the malts and alcohol and a cherry-alcohol aspect all over.  The grain alcohol aspect dies down as the beer warms and w wet leaf earthiness emerges.  A bit thinner than I like my Scotch Ales.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
690,"2010-04-07",3.9,"Sampled at RBWG 2010.  Awesome bourbon barrel character here.  Sweet, a hint of smoked malts. Good stuff!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
690,"2010-03-25",3.9,"thanks after4ever! Peaty honey aroma, seems hot and waxy in the middle. dark chestnut.interesting contrast of flavors, toasted/burnt marshmallow, floral peat, warm mulled honey finish.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
690,"2010-03-25",3.6,"Definite interesting honey/mead note on the nose. Interesting dust and almost a belgian yeast type sweetness. Notes of some alcohol and also caramel sweetness. Dark brown with amber pours not to much in the way of head or lace. Honey flavors - mead like sweet/tartness, caramel, toffe, dust, and some vodka heat. Interesting, but not really scotchy in any way to me except very late in the finish. Lingering heat in mouth.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
690,"2010-03-25",3.6,"12oz hand bottle, thanks Tom.  Pours a lighter root beer brown with little carbonation showing.  Deffinetly pick up the mead in here.  Sweet honey, touch of peat, plum, toffee.   Leather, peat, plum, some honey, vodka, a twang to it.  Interesting with the use of an old mead oak barrel.","Washington, USA","bvc"
690,"2010-03-25",3.6,"22 oz. thanks kan and tyler! pours crystal clear dark brown with bright amber edges. no head or lace. peat, caramel, vanilla, and oak on the nose. powerful and forward aromatics. sticky, flat, fairly thick body. caramel, peat, honey, and vodka on the mid palate. mild caramel finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
690,"2010-03-18",4.0,"RBWG10, cheers to JW77.
pours dark brown, off-white train.Aroma and flavors, oak barrel is a little more upfront, light roasted malts, boozy mouthfeel and some dark fruits.
Second one of that serie, the honey wine is subtle and adds a touch of sweetness with a nice buttery caramel finish.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
690,"2010-03-17",3.4,"12oz handbottle, courtesy of MatSciGuy. Thanks, Levi! Pours a very dark, amber-brown color with oily yellow edges; some slight viscosity; small, medium-tan head with mixed-bubbled, web-like lacing; attractive enough. Enormous amounts of sweetness through all of this. Huge honey notes in the nose (almost mead-like), along with some caramel and toffee notes and some vinous, slightly warming alcohol apparent; served at cellar temp, the alcohol is quite prominent, but doesnt seem overly hot or fusel-laden; generous, messy, very sweet nose; hints of a peat character as well, but I may just be getting that from the alcohol. Full body; light carbonation, reasonably viscous and heavy in the mouth; the honey and oak character here is reasonably pleasant (lightly toasted, honeyed cereal), the oak itself is quite bright; gorgeous pieces, honestly: creamy, vanilla-tinged oak; sweet maltiness (peat, caramel, nuttiness); mead-like depth of honey; but this is just immensely and unforgivably, tooth-decayingly sweet; a sweet base beer (seemingly) in a sweet barrel that matured a sweet honey wine... surprised? Generous but without limits, and a slightly messy presentation overall (alcohol is anything but quiet here); definitely a generous sipper, but not top-notch. Lasting finish of honey, toasted oak barrel, and lingering maltiness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
690,"2010-03-16",3.8,"Light brownish pour.  Aroma is interesting.  Malty and sweet.  Some honey, some fruit, yeast.  Wood. Flavor is super light on the honey, heavy on the fruit.  Medium wood flavor.  Good but weird.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
690,"2010-03-06",3.4,"Growler given to me by my generous sister and brother in law.  Pour is slight hazed ruby deep brown with a smallish tan head. Aroma of fresh wood, vanilla oak, soft caramel, along with the peat (what is there is really muted).  This nose is mostly about the barrel - it really smells like a freshly carved oak barrel. Taste is the wood right up front; sweet, vanilla, pretty harsh. The peat and malt is behind it, though certainly way in the back seat. Palate is medium, lightly carbonated - soft almost cask like body. Nice and gentle, fits nice with the flavor profile. Nice enough, though I remember liking the Town Hall normal Wee Heavy more.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
690,"2010-03-05",3.5,"Growler thx to kan. Brown red white ring. Red fruit smoked malt earthy some sweet odd note. High carbonation. Red fruit toffee malt earthy kinda messy. Dry alcoohol finish. Not bad but not great. 8/3/7/3/14 3.5","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
690,"2010-03-05",3.7,"Growler from a recent trade... Pours a reddish cola brown, semi-trasparent, with a thin wispy tan head... Aroma of smoked malt and pretty peaty overall.  Nice caramel and dark toffee and a general sweetness pervades... Flavors are generally sweet which I get more of that honeywine essence in the flavor moreso than the aroma.  Carbonation was fairly low which was an added positive. Thin to medium bodied. Fairly boozy overall but I enjoyed this moreso than the rest of the gang.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
690,"2010-03-05",3.2,"Growler from Kan, pours murky ruby red with no head. Nose smoky, red fruit, honey, toffee, fl smokey beechwood malts, toffee, fusal alc, red fruit. Off putting sweet and boozy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
690,"2010-03-04",3.8,"Growler courtesy of theisti, thanks for sharing Tim!  Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a minimal off-white head and minimal lacing.  Aroma is fresh oak, a little peat, light smoke and some dark fruits.  Flavor is full of fresh oak, a little too much barrel, more peat/smoke and some dark fruits.  A bit of weird combination of notes on the flavor, but overall not too bad, and definitely improves as it warms.  Thanks for sharing Tim!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
690,"2010-03-01",3.7,"Tap. Brown pour with red highlights. Off white head. Aroma of wood, mild bourbon, and dried fruits. Taste is smokey, wood, fruit, with the alcohol poking through late. Very good stuff.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
690,"2010-02-24",4.1,"Pours deep ruby red with off white head, aroma is full of chocolate and dark fruit.  Taste is up front full of wood, vanilla, toffee, and chocolate moving into dark fruit that sweetens out with a touch of honey.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
690,"2007-07-14",3.6,"Tap at the brewpub. Pours beautiful dark ruby. Sweet malt and fresh oak on the nose. Toffee sweet body leading to some molasses-y dryness. Dried fruit and honey. Fairly viscous with some nice carbonation. Finishes dry.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
690,"2007-07-13",4.4,"Wow...  just wow...  Dark brown color almost black with no head.  Massively oaked nose with the alcohol cutting through the dark, dried fruit undertones.  Sweet bourbon malt body with plenty of oak flavor and perhaps the faintest bit of peat cutting through (though that part might just be wishful thinking).","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
690,"2007-07-12",3.8,"A very dark brown with a bit of red color with a few spots of a head. The aroma is very big with oak and fruit and a bit of alcohol. The taste is a lot like the regular version but there is a lot of barrel aged character in this. Bourbon I presume, but not necassarily. I think the flavors in the original have faded a bit and some more full sweet dark-overly ripe fruits have shown up. Its pretty good but the barrel really didnt improve this beer.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
690,"2006-12-22",4.0,"Tap on 10/28/05.   A dark brown to black color with a rich brown head.  A chocolate and plum aroma.  Strong smoked flavors with caramel.  Rich and smooth.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
690,"2006-10-15",3.7,"Pour is opaque brownish black with a dense light brown head...smell is hardcore alcohoic and very perfumey...sweet flavor with lots of wood and smoke...alcohol not so overpowering in the flavor...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
690,"2006-10-12",3.0,"Rating #3000... Draft... GABF 06... Almost black, clear copper ale with a small, tight, khaki head. Overbearing oak along with light chocolate and butterscotch in the aroma. Woodsy, cloyingly sweet flavor with notes of chocolate and diacetyl. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Woodsy, sweet, alcoholic finish. I had higher hopes for this one; still, not bad.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
690,"2006-09-03",3.8,"Tap. Thick brown hue with little to no head.  Noticeable aromas are honey, caramel, green apples, scotch.  The caramel sweetness in the flavor is nearly overwhelming until the heavy malts balance it out.  Interesting notes of apple peels and white wine throughout.  Just a bit on the cloying side for me.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
690,"2006-08-17",3.6,"Great Taste of the Midwest

I wish I had spent more time at Town Hall as thekir offerings were interesting.
   This was a pretty good beer though I must be one of the ones who didnt
   enjoy it as much.  Still, I was definitely be stopping by Town Hall when I
   am in Minneapolis - they know their stuff.
Aroma / Appearance - Honey, oak, caramel, peat, Fruit loops and
   applesauce played across my nose.  I wasnt sure what to make it with a nose
   like that - it is among the most diverse and unusual I have smelled from a
   barrel aged beer.  The pour looked like flat Dr Pepper with a thin amount of
   head floating over the top like oil on water.
Flavor / Palate - Cortland apples, pears, peaches, blueberries, honey
   nut cheerios and applesauce were the first things to come to mind.  It was
   very fruit at first which threw me for a little bit.  The second sip was even
   stranger as I was reminded of tuna salad.  The finish was like confectionary
   sugar - sweet and a bit dry.  Overall it was enjoyable but the flavors were
   just a bit all over the place.  With a little more cohesion, this would be
   a 4.0.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
690,"2006-08-13",4.0,"Sampled at GTMW 2006.  The beer pours to a very dark garnet body with a thin lasting tan head.  The aroma is sweet floral honey, unknown fruits, peat.  The flavor is extremely fruity honey... perhaps pineapple.  Peat and chocolate.  Ive never had anything like this.  Quite delicious.  Coating sweet palate.  Medium bodied.  Very drinkable.  Makes me wish I would have tried the regular version.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
690,"2005-12-03",4.5,"Thanks Hopdog for sharing a growler.  Pours deep red wine, somewhat brown body.  Medium tan foaming head.  Aroma of granny smith apple dipped into caramel.  Also some malt, toffee, wood, light smoke.  Flavor starts smokey, then blends some brown sugar, apple.  Smooth creamy and soft.  One of the best beers Ive had.","Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania, USA","fatty"
690,"2005-12-03",4.3,"Tasted from Growler acquired in trade with robertsreality (big thanks!). Poured a dark, dark reddish brown with an averaged to larger sized tan head. Aromas of wood (oak), some vanilla, caramel, dark fruits, light bourbon, and a little earthy (great aroma). Tastes of brown sugar, smoke, chocolate, and vanilla. Medium honey sweetness. Some lacing left on the glass. Nice smooth and creamy body. I was really into this one!","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
690,"2005-12-02",4.5,"Thanks to hopdog for sharing this from the growler he landed. What a treat.  Pours a darker ruby brown with an average tan lacing head.  Great head for a growler that was poured almost a month ago.  Aroma of caramel, dark fruits, molasses, bourbon, honey, grapes.  Shared this with Fatty as well and he nailed the aroma ""granny smith apple dipped in that caramel dip"".  Flavor of brown sugar, honey, a little smoked, apple cider.  What a great beer, wish I would have had a glass of this straight from the tap.  Very smooth and creamy palate.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
690,"2005-11-13",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2007 Dark Brown/Black Coloring with No Head.  Nice Honey Oak Flavors...and While the Barrell Gives Much to the Flavor, I Fear it Masks What Makes the Wee Heavy. Instead of the Barrell Adding to the Brew, The Brew Gives Homage to the Barrell. Still Quite Enjoyable.

Revisited 2007: Dark Brown Color with Sandy Ring. Rich Aromas..Alcohol and Smoked Malt, Notably. Medium Bodied and Syrupy Mouthfeel. Lightly Vinous..Oak Notes with Light Fruit, Dry Bread, Toasted Caramel and  Dry Bittersweet Flavor Througout...With Dominate Notes of Smoked Malt...The Smoke Notes are Kept in Check Well...Overall...a Carbonated, Crisp Bittersweet and Smoked Flavored Aftertaste...","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
690,"2005-10-31",4.5,"I was overwhelmed with this beer.  Incredible aroma, virtually unique in my 2000-beer experience, with a massive profusion of fresh figs, plus vanilla and wood.  Smooth yet chewy palate.  Dark with ruby tingers to the brown, swirls nicely to a cream head.  I think if you had this for an hour it might go flat and lose a good deal of its interest in the mouth, but it was too drinkable for my small glass to last for more than a half hour of sitting with it.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
690,"2005-10-30",4.1,"8th anniversary release. This is better than the original Wee Heavy. Less sugary. But, this is still not as good as the 2004 Imperial Stout nor the French Oak Old Ale that were served on Thursday during 8th anniversary week. Faint, caramel chocolate notes in teh nose. Opaque body with a thin, off-white head and decent lace. Sweet with a high alcohol profile. Winter warmer qualities. Doesnt blow me away but it is very good.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
690,"2005-10-29",4.1,"Town Hall 8th Anniversary, Saturday release:  Black color with no head.  Very thin aroma of port and chocolate.  The taste is quite syrupy with some obvious honey notes.  Sweet malt base.  It seems to have inherited wine qualities from the barrel.  Damn fine.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
690,"2005-10-29",4.4,"Excellent aroma of port, plums, and malt.  The beer is black with only a thin layer of foam.  Outstanding flavor.  This beer is sweet, but not as sweet as the non-oak aged version.  There are flavors of more port and aged red wine with tannins.  Some fruit, and more malt.  It becomes better, sweeter, and more full bodied as it warms to room termperature.  This is an outstanding beer, and sadly they only made enough to last for one hour on tap at the brewpub.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
