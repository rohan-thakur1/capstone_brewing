1747,"2005-05-27",3.6,"Pours pretty cloudy due to a good amount of yeast sedimetn.  Relatively light for an oktoberfest, being a golden deep yellow.  Low head.  Aroma is delicately smooht with light malts, munich, and some earthy and slightly floral hops.  Flaovr is subtly in that it has a medium maltiness but balances well with the hops.  Pretty good and smooth but needs to be a little darker and a little bit more malty for an oktoberfest.  Perhaps more body is needed too. Pretty good overall but I expected a bit more from burgerbrau.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

1747,"2005-01-31",4.2,"Post-EBF at Clarks Huge frothy white head tops a spectacular bottle-conditioned wonder of a murky brown body with tons of yeasties. Funky creamy farm aroma proposes plenty of hay, flowers, dandelions and honeysuckle hallertau flavours. Atypical Oktoberfest to say the least. It may be a bit old though as this is not so tasty as expected and surprisingly far hoppier than anticipated to be. Subdued caramelised apples are marched over by the floral hallertau that sticks on the tongue. Marvellous texture, fluffy, creamy, decadently full bodied. Original and delicate. Keep them coming Clark!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1747,"2004-09-26",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2005 I think this was last years bottle (2003).  Pours a light copper, minimal cloudiness, but obviously not highly filtered.  Good white head.  Smells of light grains, hint of metal and a touch of lightly fragrant hops.  Flavor is well-balanced, mostly dry though, with some good malt balancing out the dryness and hops.  Nothing terribly exciting going on.  Some honey and a dry nut-toffee like flavor on the finish.  Well-made. 5/4/6/3/12Rerate Same bottling as before.  Much better than I recall, with a much hazier look to it.  This stuff resembled split pea soup.  Green, brown and copper all swirled about, with so much sediment it dosent look like beer.  Honey sweet malt in the aroma, with yeast notes, vanilla?, and some metal.  Flavors of caramel and vanilla ice cream up front, very sweet and creamy, with orange blossoms and a bit of tart yeast notes as it passes down the throat.  Lightly sour/bitter hops, a bit oily in texture towards the end, with some sweetness resumed.  Hmm, everyone else loved this, so Im glad for that, but it still dosent do that much for me. 7/5/7/4/15","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1747,"2004-06-28",2.3,"06.28.04  500ml bottle.  This had an unusual pour and right off the bat I thought I might have bought a bad bottle.  The beer is a yellowish gold and is essentially flat looking with so few bubbles I could count them.  There is barely any head.  So far, not what Id expect from a festbier.  The aromas are sour on top of some lemon and honey, not too appealing, honestly.  The beer redeems itself somewhat in flavor by not being as off-putting as the appearance and aroma.  Very raw grain flavors with a  grassy bite.   Quite malty and mild, but not really sweet, a bit on the bland side.  The body is thick and soft; wheres the carbonation?  Overall, not a great experience.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1747,"2004-03-27",3.9,"A very impressive lager.  Has that classic Burgerbrau character, with a surprisingly light yet creamy body.  This reminded me quite a bit of their Helles (with more malt) and of Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold.  Poured hazy light orange with just a few bubbles.  Lemony aroma with hints of caramel and spicy hops.  Very nice flavor- sweet, fruity (lemon) with caramel and biscuit, finishing with earthy hops.  The flavors combine to taste like cookie dough.  Not as densely caramely or toasty as many other Oktoberfests, this beer is closer to a Dortmunder but darker with more malt character.  We have a winner!","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

1747,"2003-10-19",3.5,"How'd they do that? Just as JPDIPSO described the bubbles were suspended in the beer. It seemed almost gooey. It poured orange brown with almost no head. It seemed syrup-like when I poured it. Even the yeast/sediment was suspended in strands. I thought it was a bad bottle, but it's not. The nose seems fairly plain with light malt and yeast. It has a silky smooth mouthfeel and the taste has some tartness but malt, yeast and some light hop character. Damn interesting. What a twist on a ""standard"" Octoberfest! The finish is smooth but a little bland. Good beer though!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1747,"2003-10-11",3.3,"Pours a thick hazy light copper with a thin white head. Bubbles behaved exactly as JPDIPSO described.  Sour caramel malt aroma has a touch of noble hops.  Body was very acidic at colder temperatures, but got better as it warmed.  Sweet crisp body has grainy malt flavors and a dry hoppiness, with a light tartness throughout.  I'm not sure if the sourness is supposed to be there or not, but otherwise a decent Oktoberfest.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1747,"2003-10-06",4.2,"The pour is one of the most interesting I've ever had. A heavy dark golden/near amber color liquid, in which the bubbles stay in suspension for a long time and then float about and meander to the top to form a smaller cream colored head. Aroma is slightly malty, with herbal hops and undertones of honey, lemon zest, and apricots.  Pure heavy malt starts in the front of the tongue. Leading to a light floral hops that linger and float around, somewhat like the bubbles in the pour. Smooth, near oily in feel.  Later, as the brew warms the honey and clover flavors come out and the hops linger longer in the finish. The finish is superb! A terrific balance of malt and hops.  This is the third of four bottles I purchased, and each time I have had one I like it a little bit more.  A few more and this may be on the top of my list.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

It was toward the yellow end of the spectrum. There was a ton (and I mean you could stand a spoon up) of body. We speculated that they used raw barley to give it that oily thickness. I kinda got tired of it about half way through.

In fact, I have to add some palate points. Delicious! Original: 11/27/2002: Man! Deliciously light and airy. The most beautiful Hallertau earthy softness aroma (I want to dunk my pillowcase in the aroma and sleep on it!). Not exactly toasty or caramelly in the same way Ive had, or even that out in the country maltiness -- just a bit sweet. Nicely made, and quite subtle.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted light bread, caramel, cookie), heavily hoppy (flowers, herbs), with strong notes of orange, apricot, honey, and peach. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter, lightly acidic. Medium body, watery (almost creamy) texture, lively carbonation.  Ive had this a number of times since I first rated it over two months ago, and there is just no pussy-footing around about the aroma.  It is absolutely stunning...even in a wide mouthed mug, it still blows my nose away with honeysuckle and toasted bread and all sorts of fruits.  And then of course theres the flavor balance...and the amazing appearance.  There is virtually no hope of finding anything better in this style.  The definition of luscious.

Classy flavors offer a hint of barnyard, honey, including a long malty and satisfyingly  spicy hop finish.  More Hallertauers on the nose would have made this aroma perfect.

The malt contains, I believe, less of the roasted character that you find with most Maerzens.  Instead, this one relies upon hops for structure, which join up with the malt very nicely toward the end.  The finish is extremely long and dry.
