3166,"2016-08-09",4.0,"Shared at an Ann Arbor get together at Jeffs on July 20. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a foggy golden yellow color with a thick cap of white head that slowly fades. The aroma is incredibly funky. There is a light acidity and a ton of fruit. There is a brighter berry and citrus to it, and then the funk rolls in a little heavier. Here is a ton of juice here. The flavor is a little better. The funk is toned down, letting the flesh and juiciness of the peaches really shine. There is a tart citrus and a lovely berry happening. The mouth feel is really good. Its light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a heavy juiciness at the same time. It finishes crisp and dry with a peachy flesh and dry funk on the back end. This is pretty good. Not quite what I was expecting, but incredibly balanced!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3166,"2016-06-19",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Strawberry allusions blend in nicely with the lambic-like funk, playing harmoniously with lactic acidity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the misty golden honey.
-The soft effervescence, dryness and acidity make for high drinkability.
-The fruit character is warm and juicy (not necessarily full on peaches; I got more strawberry and kiwi than peaches actually).
-This is not just another funky beer. It actually has a unique profile that is showcased in a refined manner. Very, very good brew.

The aroma is reasonably earthy at the start but this gives way to bright fruit i.e. lemon and apricot especially. The funkiness is mild, a touch horse blanket like and a little leathery. 

The flavor is bright and fruity with lots of apricot. The beer is medium dry and has a very pleasant level of sourness. The beer has some faint herbal notes and a little bit of bitterness. The acidity is brilliant and the woodiness seems like white oak, although who knows. Just lots of tartness & apricot.

3166,"2015-08-06",4.2,"750 mL, unsure of the date, shared by Scott on 7/25/15.White peach colored body is gently hazy and has a small, white head that recedes to cover.Near perfect mix of peach and lactic acid in the nose is gentle yet still contains some lightly bright elements of peach juice. Nicely attenuated malts add little to no sweetness and allow some grainy character to assert some beeriness here. Subtle funk, a bit of earthiness and just more lactic-peach goodness lingering.Flavor is impossibly mild, yet with soft sourness and good, earthy funk. Damp hay, sun-baked grains and moderately sweet peach-apricot flavors are all extremely enjoyable. Lighter carbonation, but whats there is tight, providing good crispness to the finish and accentuating the sour acidity and vibrant fruit character. Watery and just unbelievably drinkable.

3166,"2015-01-09",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2015 Bottle split with friends. Appearance: Head lasts only for a second. Cloudy orange in the glass. Aroma is odd - peach-flavored laffy taffy and bubblegum. Some funk and oak for sure, but what comes through behind that is peach flavored laffy taffy bubblegum. Taste brings vanilla, more laffy taffy, and now that Matt mentions it, cookies and cream Hersheys white chocolate. Not at all what I expected. Sweeter than anticipated. Theres tartness for sure, and some funk to boot, but mostly what comes across behind that is a lot of vanilla and sweetness. Peaches and cream. Palate: light body, soft carbonation, slick texture. Overall: I may sit on a bottle. Or I may not. Ive been wanting this for a long time. Glad to have had it. Not something I expect Ill crave, but Ill repeat it down the road.

At first the nose brings on a powerful funk, but that is quickly replaced by very sweet artificial candy flavors. We struggled for a bit to pick them out; candidates include laffy taffy, spree, Haribo gummy peaches for the fruit; fruity bubble gum; white chocolate or in particular cookies-and-cream bar. The flavor is sweet-tart, very accessible with ample peach sweetness rather than peach-skin tartness. Some interesting tannic elements and modest overall acidity. Its a good beer, and enjoyable to drink, but this batch is not a world-beater, and it leaves me wondering how this could be a 99th percentile sour.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3166,"2014-01-01",3.7,"In short: A wild, fruity and dry orange ale with a weak mouthfeel.
How: Bottle 750ml, white waxed top, consumed when some months of age, bottle sent to me by julian, thanks a lot Julian (how long did it take you to come up with your ratebeer nickname?).
The look: Cloudy orange body topped by an off-white ring of foam.
In long: Nose is somewhat fruity and with a nice rustic & wild character, bretty, lactic, cobweb, a piece of fruits I found in my armpit, peaches, candied oranges. The mouthfeel unfortunately lacks vigour, plenty of body for its size but the sparse carbonation (to put it mildy) is the beer weak point. Taste is fruity (peaches and various dried fruits) supported by a dry grainy malt backbone that feels like yellowed sundried straws. Moderately funky and moderately sour and fortunately almost no vinegary flavor. Tart fruits along with a sour yogurt sensation. Wild yeast and oak tannins take over at the end for a very dry finish. Overall pretty good, Im certain a more lively body would have increased my enjoyment of the flavors, not just the mouthfeel.

A - Pours a hazy...well its a peach colored body. An initial fingers worth of soapy foam with large bubbles forms but settles into some edging pretty quickly. Decent lacing with minimal retention. The peach color though, man does it look good. 

S - Super funky brettanomyces and lactic acid followed by over ripe peach juice. There is a subtle, almost spicy vanilla thing that I get on the very end that I would imagine is coming from the barrels.

T - That distinct brett funk followed by a wave of lactic acid twang. This goes head to head with sweet peach juice and a touch of oak. Lightly sour with a long lasting juiciness. This is a very drinkable beer and something that is perfect for the warmer months. Mouth feel is crisp and lively while maintaining a medium body.

A: Pours a clear amber color with a frothy white head forming on the pour. It recedes to an airy ring that leaves some splotches of lace.

S: Sweet fruit with peach flesh coming through and then some soft pear. Mild red berry with some tartness and light pale malt. Not much in the form of sourness going on in the nose.

T: The taste wasnt as substantial as the nose for me. Some light peach flesh and red apple skins, a mild tartness and the slightest hint of lacto sourness. Definitely some sweet malts in the finish, but there really wasnt anything for it to cut through.

M: Light bodied with a clean and sweet finish. Nice prickly carbonation as well.

O: Definitely missed a lot of the lacto qualities in this one. It lost a lot of points as it didnt quite fit the bill I was hoping for. The nose gave it promise, but the taste fell a little flat. It was still an easy drinking beer that tastes good, though. Recommend.

Pours a nice peachy color with a foamy white head with good retention and a ring or two of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a tremendous peach presence that is just absolutely killer. Behind that is a light bit of pilsner malt along with a fairly-strong lactic presence.

The flavor hits the peach and lactic combination quite well, but lacks enough earthy and wild depth to really take it over the top. With that said, Im still quite impressed, especially flowing into the feel, which has a nice level of acidity to make the peach flavor.

The beer itself is a hazy tangerine color.  Very hazy with golden edges and a fair amount of sediment rests on the bottom of the glass.

The aroma is lactic and peach, with a strong and pleasant flavor.  There is a bit of acetic or vinegar tartness in the nose as well.  A bit of vanilla yogurt and oak round out the aroma.  A little bit of barnyard in the back.

The flavor starts a little bit sweet.  There is a touch of sweet honey of pale malt before sweet peach and vanilla slowly turns tart and lactic.  There is a little bit of a growing lemon zest as the sip goes on.  

The body is on the fuller side of medium for an American Wild.  The carbonation is medium and smooth, with a slightly grainy tone.  It is sour, with both lactic and some acetic notes.

Nose is underwhelming, there is a little peach yogurt character to the nose, not much acidity though. Interesting peach character in the flavor profile, there is peach yogurt, cinnamon, and vanilla. More carbonated than the first bottle we cracked, but still gentle carbonation. Some light acidity, and a medium to long finish. Second bottle was a pleasant surprise, a lot better than the first we opened. Fresh peach punches you in the face and never lets up. Nice, tart flavor.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
3166,"2012-03-13",4.1,"Pours out a murky golden brown with limited carb.  Tastes like fresh yogurt and peaches.  Its tart, but not overly sour.  Impressive beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","readbaron"
3166,"2012-02-29",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2012 Slightly hazy, yellow/gold pour with a minimal head.  Gorgeous peaches in the nose ... slight wood/vanilla as it warms, along with a restrained touch of cheesy funk.  I could smell this all night.  Flavor shines with peaches and stone fruit skins that are carried by a nice lemony tartness.  Body is light to medium, carb is lively, and the finish is where I am torn.  The tartness is great, but there is also a vinegar-like acidity that is just a bit too sharp.  Still very enjoyable (love the freshness of the fruit and the light, cheesy funk), but that overt sharpness really hinders the drinkability for me.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
3166,"2012-02-29",3.9,"Thanks to Wally for this treat!  Poured into a tulip glass.  Cloudy orange body without much of any head.  Aroma is filled with soured peaches, light acetone and some grassy notes.  Flavor is much the same but adds some creamy vanilla components.  Nice level of sourness throughout.  Brings Fou Foune to mind, but isnt any easier for me to get, haha.  Definitely worth trying if you can find it.","New Hampshire, USA","sisuspeed"
3166,"2012-02-27",4.5,"Wow. Only 8 ratings. A friend brought this over following a trade with a west coast partner. Poured at room temp into a tulip

A - 1/4 finger on a vigorous pour. This is a deep orange beer with plenty of clouds and some yellow in here.

S - Orange Peels are very pleasant. Lots of peach juice, sour and tart scents with lavender and honey. VERY enjoyable.

T - Sour is right out of the gate BOOM. Peaches are next and add a tart and pucker thats just like eating a peach with the fuzzy left on. Lemons, floral and some oak comes through at the end.

M - 50/50 bubbles on a mouth swish. Its a very dry beer with great floral lingering.

O - UTTERLY DELICIOUS. I need many more of these NOW.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3166,"2012-02-22",4.1,"Pours a hazed golden orange color with a white head.  An amazing fruit aroma.  Tons of peaches on the nose which give a nice sweetness along with the tartness of the beer.  Oak, grass, and lemon provide a nice funk and sourness.  The peaches are just as vibrant on the palate.  Intense fruit flavor with background notes of oak, lemon, lemon peel, and grass.  A hint of vanilla from the oak as the beer warms.  Really outstanding stuff.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3166,"2012-02-17",4.4,"Bottle courtesy of deyholla. Pours hazy orange, bordering on garnet. Very little head, especially by a couple of minutes in. Good carbonation, but soft. Nose: wow. Just barrels and barrels of ripe peach, sweetened vinegar, candied citrus. More peach in a big way on the tongue, massive tartness and barnyard-ish funk. This was right in the middle of an epic tasting, and it still stands out as the highlight. Exceptional.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jlruthven"
3166,"2012-02-16",4.4,"Bottle shared by deyholla thanks Derick .  So far this is the star of the night.  I am all stuffed up and it still smells fantastic.   Peach and tartness just fantastic.","Waunakee, Wisconsin, USA","MrPickles"
3166,"2012-02-16",4.2,"Bottle shared by deyholla...thanks Derek! - Hazy light amber with a thin foamy white head. Wow...the nose is great. Fresh peaches with a nice acidic note--ridiculously fresh. Not a ton of funk on the nose, but just a touch of sharpness. The taste is much more funky. Lots of acidic, vinegary notes, lemon and a bit cheesy. Feathery, fluffy carbonation. Beautiful beer.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
3166,"2012-02-16",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2016 Bottle thanks to westmeister! Pours a cloudy peach gold with a white head that starts at the edges and dissipates completely. Aroma is full of peach with a light tartness and a nice earthy funk note. Flavor starts a really nice juicy peach note with a growing tartness and a hint of funk.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3166,"2012-02-03",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2012 Bottle. Pours a deep color amber orange color with a slight collared white head. Slightly cloudy. Nice aroma, a little on the sweet side but a nice peach note along with some funkiness. More on the acidic side than true european funk. Light/medium mouthfeel. Nice sweet peach notes with a nice mild sourness. A slight bitterness in the end but very mild. I could see this getting more sour with some age.  This is a very solid beer but for sure not as deep and extreme as the belgian styles but for a US version it is really good. Glad I grabbed a few bottles to let this develop more. Thought this beer was extremely well done.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
3166,"2012-02-03",4.2,"Yellow/orangish pour. Peaches, acedic acid, yeasty aroma. Lots of peaches, sourness, vinegar, light woody notes. Nice!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3166,"2012-01-30",3.7,"Bottle shared at recent BA/RB tasting...  Poured a hazy, pale orange with a white head.  Good peach flavors with some acidic sourness.  A little bit of funk and earthiness.  Not too much carbonation, and nice soft mouthfeel.  Good tasting, quenching.  Not overly complex for the high price tag.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
