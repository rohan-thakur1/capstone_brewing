1347,"2014-08-02",3.9,"Draught. Pours a near black color with a very small tan head on there. Nose is quite malty with a lot of caramel and just a bit of toast to it. Taste is pretty roasty and has come chocolate and coffee notes. Drinks a bit more like a porter. Quite tasty.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
1347,"2012-08-27",3.5,"(22oz bottle)  Pours a dark mahogany body with a tall foamy cola head.  Aroma of cherry, caramel, light sour infection notes, chocolate, and roasted malt.  Flavor of roasted malt, caramel, light ash, cola, chocolate, and some sourness from an infection that is probably helping this beer.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
1347,"2012-07-25",3.6,"Bought a 22oz (651ml-not 650ml here?!?!) bottle of this from the Beer Shoppe in Yakima, WA for $4.99. Poured from the Green Labeled bottle w/ Reindeer on the front?? into a 16oz Arcadia IPA Pint Glass. Has no freshness date but not worried since its a local brew.

Aroma- A malty, sweet aroma with some light roasty characters. Not strong enough but all around has what the style should be focusing on. 

Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that has decent head retention. Has a medium brown with copper highlights in the body and leaves a few suds behind. 

Flavor- Rich, malty, and has a good espresso roast flavor. Medium bitterness in the finish leading me to ask how much hop they really put in here!?!? Very good! Bit of caramel in the background. 

Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Semi-chewy, and very smooth with well-balanced malt to hop ratio. 

Overall Impression- A nicely brewed sweet, scottish ale with a good amount of roast and light coffee attribute. It was very drinkable and never had too much or too little of anything. Aroma could be a bit more character involved and strong but not too bad!","Ballwin, Missouri, USA","DConMan"
1347,"2012-05-25",3.0,"Bomber. Okay, first thing--there is something wrong with this beer. When I poured it, slowly even, there was a centimeter of liquid at the bottom of the glass; the rest of the glass was all foam--a giant tan ice-cream-float-like head. Aroma is full of molasses, caramel. After that giant head finally disappears, the liquid greeting my tastebuds is lightly malty sweet, peaty, a touch sour. Carbonation is soft, body medium. Let me re-rate this when I get a normal bottle.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
1347,"2011-11-26",3.6,"Bottle: &nbsp Deep cola, dirty, moderate foamy light beige head, sparce lacing. &nbsp Peat, campfire, charred 

wood, and dark chocolate on the nose. &nbsp As it warms I am also getting some cocoa. &nbsp Soft maltiness on the 

tongue, not as heavy as I would have liked but decent. &nbsp A little tangy, slight tart bite. &nbsp Body and 

mouthfeel are moderate, finishes a little thin tho. &nbsp Has quite a bit of flavor, which is nice. &nbsp Moderate 

sweetness. &nbsp Surprised this one was as dark as it was. &nbsp Fair offering, nice combo of flavors, but just not 

really all that malty.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
1347,"2011-10-23",3.6,"650ml bottle pours a dark brown color with a small beige head and some thin lacing.  Aroma is roasted malts.  Taste is heavy roasted malty sweetness with a light hoppy bitterness in the finish.  Medium to heavy body and moderate carbonation give a nice mouthfeel.  This is a pretty decent scotch style ale worthy of a taste.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
1347,"2011-10-07",2.9,"Nice very deep carmel color. Malty nose. Very carbonated. Taste is ok. A bit malty. Ok beer.","Washington, USA","cstuartj"
1347,"2011-06-11",3.4,"Deep brown, light tan ring of bubbles.  Roasty nose, a little figgy, toasty, burnt toffee sweetness.  Surprisingly sweet when sipped, sticky toffee, more roast, light burnt notes, earthy mild hops.  Scotch ales dont tend to blow me away, but like many of them, this beer has a lot of drinkability.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"
1347,"2011-05-30",3.5,"11th rating of this bitch. What. Rating beer sucks. Anyways... Nose is toasty with notes of toffee earth, dark fruit, chocolate, and roast. Pours dark brown, thin head. Flavor is toasty, roasty with notes of chocolate, dark fruit and toffee. Light earthy bitterness. Smooth body, medium sweet, well balanced. Decently drinkable well put together. Fuck.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
1347,"2011-05-15",3.2,"Tap: Dark brown with a tan ring head. Malty choco aroma with a stronger flavor than expected. Kind of tastes like a malty porter. Smooth aftertaste.","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"
1347,"2011-02-03",3.8,"Bomber from Malt & Vine. Pours thick and dark with some transitory tan bubbles. From a foot away the aroma seems anise. Up close it seems chcocolate and dark fruit. Near full body. Flavor is kind of a raisin/chocolate/anise combo. Finishes with a smokey note. Then it goes more like treacle/raisin. Ok, mysterious and complex work here.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1347,"2010-06-08",3.6,"Dark brown color/ viscous tan head. Oily, smoky, earthy mushroom, mild chocolate aromas. Light to medium bodied/ well carbonated.

smell is of cocoa, malt, and a touch of coffee.

taste is smooth, cocoa, some coffee, some sour malt, and hops in the back, ends a little on the dry side.","Bremerton, Washington, USA","robforbes"
1347,"2009-06-01",3.5,"Deep maroon, nearly black, with crisp browned top. Nice complexity of crystal/caramel malts lending the brew with an excellent scotch character. Bubblegum also impinges upon the olfactory sense. Muskiness malt flavor along with bubblegum, candi sugar and well-rounded maltiness. Very sweet, but enjoyable.A nice take on the style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
1347,"2009-05-31",3.5,"22. Thanks, Scrizzz! Pours translucent and incredibly dark brown with a lacy beige head. Vanilla and caramel aroma. Light body and carbonation. Brown sugar and roasted caramel taste with a smoky finish.","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"
1347,"2009-05-31",3.2,"22. Thanks, Scrizzz! Pours a dark brown, nearly opaque, with bright rubied highlights in the corners. Not much head. Brown bread and brown sugar in the nose. Watery, lightish body. Light brown bread notes and caramel on the mid-palate. Mild finish. A little lacking in force and power.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
