4324,"2016-12-21",3.5,"355 ml bottle bought at HK Brewcraft in Central.
Looks: Clear, deep ruby redHalf finger head with soapy light beige foam which fades in 30 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing with active slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant and sweet rich malt, with strong Bock-ishness, strong red fruit, dried fruits, alcohol, strong caramel, sticky toffee, strong floral, sugar, spices, biscuits, light lemon and grass. Nice!

Taste: Close to light sweet Ale malt, with caramel, toffee, light alcohol, strong liquorices, floral, light molasses, earth, strong spices, dry biscuits, strong lemon, quite strong bitter hops and sharp grass.

Body: Medium body. Quite slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Very solid Ale maltyness in a slick and quite oily background. Very low sweetness which is surprising for a winter warmer. Low booze with strong liquorices, flowery and pretty spicy with herbal edge. Biscuity with strong lemon to round. Quite sharp and neat!

Hoppiness: Dried fruits, strong floral, spices, light lemon and grass in nose. Earth, floral, strong spices, strong lemon, and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, mid to high astringent herbal malty finish.

After Taste: Dry; Spicy and quite bitter to mouth.

Comments: Its pleasant sweet Bockish aroma suggests a liquid fruitcake. The taste reveals a spicy herbal Amber Ale with lean sweetness which reminds me of Leffe Noël. Enjoyable already, but with a bit more sweetness this will be a perfect merry Xmas. Worth trying!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Light full bodied with an almost creamy texture. Normal carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.

The flavor profile is quite good, but falls short of outstanding due to the overbalance of the chicory and tobacco notes.

Complex aromas but surprisingly thin flavours and body. I dont often say this, but this is a brew that could use a little more sweetness.

Pours a deep amber with reddish hues when held up to the light. The head is about a medium size, tight, well retained, & leaving of a lacing on the glass.

The aroma is chocolate, plenty of fruit character some cooked some fresh, apples, cherries a little fresh pear. Its lightly nutty and certainly shows the alcohol in the aroma. Plesant & inviting, certainly one of those things that I mostly only have patience for when its cold out, so yippee, cause its freezin 

The flavor is nutty & a little roasty, again the alcohol shows prominently in the flavor as it did on the nose. Its got a nice hoppy bitterness throughout but nothing to detract from the malt going on here, but rather it serves as pretty complimentary. Its got plenty of apple and a good bit of earthiness.

4324,"2015-10-29",3.7,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a rather deep brown/mahogany color with a one finger head of tan foam. The head has a good level of staying power, with it very slowly fading over time to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the brew is big of a sweeter candied sugar and molasses smell with a whole lot of a dark fruits of raisin, cherry, and plum. There are some lighter spice smells of coriander and clove with a decent showing of some roasted bready smells, giving a nice dark and sweet smell overall.
 Taste  The taste begins much drier then I was anticipating from the nose. It begins with a quite roasty taste with a whole lot of roasty malt mixed with just a little bit of breadiness and some lightly sweet tastes of molasses and dark fruits. The sweeter tastes, while not very strong upfront, fade even more as the taste advances, all while the roast seems to increase a bit. With the increase in roast and the loss of sweetness, comes some light spice of coriander and clove as well as some light hop tastes of a more earthy nature. With a bit of a booziness (surprising at only 6.7 %) and a little bit of bitter coffee coming at the end, one is left with a sorta drier and dark spiced ale taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is rather thin and the carbonation rather high for the dark and roasted flavors of the brew. A thicker and chewier feel with a lower carbonation would have been better for the mix of lighter sweet fruit and dark roasty tastes of the brew, making a better medium to keep it a mouth coating slow sipper.
 Overall- This was much drier and slightly more boozy brew then I was expecting. It was an alright winter warmer, but the lack of body and somewhat contradictory nature of the nose and mouthfeel with that of the taste and look, sorta kicks it down a bit. OK, but nothing too exceptional in my opinion.","","Darkmagus82"

This beer is dark to look at, especially in a pub atmosphere, but it does not block out the sun like a Guiness or Belhaven Stout. This is a nice seasonal beer. And as a rule, Ive not recommended many or any seasonal beers short of some favorite Bavarian Oktobetfest delights. Deshutes does not make any mistakes.

4324,"2014-10-30",3.8,"You never know what youll get out of Christmas beers. Some folks go the spiced rout and some just make a strong ale while others just do some random thing. I prefer this to fall where everyone just makes a shit spiced beer and calls it a day. This is some sort of strong malt-forward strong amber brew. I am not sure what style Id call it. It is a gorgeous beer w/ a dark amber color and an extremely creamy looking off white head. There is a touch of citrus rind and slightly piney gingerlike character to the nose from the hops which is backed up by a bit of toasted malt goodness. The texture is nice and creamy and just slightly rich and heavy which works well here but might be a bit much were this a bit more bitter. As it warms, dried fruit notes come out which compliments the sweetness implied by the malts. It finishes pretty dry though and drinks just about right for a beer of its gravity. I can get behind a beer like this w/ slightly higher than usual gravity but having enough flavor to justify it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

4324,"2014-10-14",3.4,"12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass at ~45 degrees F.

A: Pours a reddish-amber, and forms a thick, frothy tan head with an orange tint. The head lasts a good long while, and leaves some serious lacing on the glass while it does. Held to light, the beer is a hazy red-amber, with no visible bubbles rising anywhere.

S: Malt and spice greet one at the fore of the nose, with hints of something floral and piney beneath. The aroma is primarily toasted caramel malt and spices, however, mainly clove and nutmeg.

T: Floral and piney notes are confirmed in the taste, beneath caramel malt so heavily toasted that it is nearly all bitter, not so much sweet. The spice notes are subtle rather than bold, appearing as just hints of ginger and nutmeg, not so much clove. Some fruitiness is present, but only in the middle of a sip. Floral bitterness lingers a while after the finish.

M: Smooth, light-to-medium in body, with carbonation on the lower side.

O: A solid winter warmer of the brown ale variety. Id personally have preferred something with more spice emphasis and less floral-pine influence, though I am an admitted malthead. The body seemed a touch on the light side for a winter beer, and Id also have liked the malt to be less toasted bitter, to allow more sweetness in. Still, not a bad beer.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

4324,"2014-02-02",2.9,"Reviewed from notes
She pours a fairly dark brown and leaves the same colored body with a white almost off white colored half finger head that dies to a small coating on the top of the body. Some spotty lacing is left.
The smell has a malty sort of caramel but kinda coming through in a bland sort of way. Still theres some toasty yet also somewhat burnt nuttiness, spice tries to come through but stays muted for the most part.
The taste has a bland earthy caramel nuttiness, malty nutty aftertaste, dry finish.
The palate has a medium body, fairly sessionable - as sessionable as a winter warmer can be. Carbonation is fairly smooth and good for the style, decent to me.
Overall, for the most part, I tend to like Deschutes a ton, but this one is honestly only average to me.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Beautiful looking ruby body, decent clarity, with a dense creamy beige head topping of precedings.
Good intensity to the nose; rich crystal malt characters of roast nuts, burnt caramels and light charred bread layered with earthy hop spices and vinous plummy fruit esters.
Excellent weight to the palate; chewy, almost sticky malt texture. Subdued carbonation contributes to the lusciousness.
Palate packed full of rich malt; toffee, golden syrup, treacle, nuts, toast and a touch of cocoa. Finishes with an assertive bitterness, lingering notes of dried leafy herbs, earthy hops and red plum fruits.

4324,"2014-01-04",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2015 12 oz bottle poured into a brandy snifter. A very potent sweet cherry aroma comes through first along with some other citrus notes in the background. As this aroma mellows out, some faint clove, cinnamon, and caramel notes arise - in turn, the sweet cherry smell becomes more of a cranberry apple juice aroma. It pours a deep, dark, and hazy mahogany color with a light tan, soap-like head that leaves some trace lacing along the glass. The initial taste is almost overwhelmingly sweet and tart (cherries come back to mind) with a noticeable, but light, bitterness. The initial tartness fades as the beer warms up and some toastiness, doughiness and spiciness come through - overcooked cinnamon apple muffins come to mind.

4324,"2013-11-24",4.0,"Pours a ruby brown when held to the natural light and a perfect garnet when held to the indoor light. Has some honey gold and brown hues and good clarity. A fat khaki head of foam that falls like a lazy Sunday morning. Laces like it means to with rings and patches. Nose is malty and sweet. Some lightly sweet chocolate and dark fruit. Some spice and some earthy leafy depth. Has a little cinnamon and nutmeg but they are blended so well that its hard to pick them out. Taste is dynamite. The malt is perfection and smooth and full but not too heavy. The chocolate is less powerful in the taste and the earth and grain from the roast comes to the forefront. I love how this beer has a roasted quality that comes right to the edge of where it would have become bold and impudent like a stout but stopped gently. It has grain in the taste and thats how well done it is. The fruit takes a back seat but sweetens this beer subtly and without too much fanfare for a pleasant and mild flavor overall. The mouthfeel is excellent and the hops show off a touch of bitter alongside a bit of bitter from the roast in the finish that I thought was especially festive. has a nice gentle warming from the alcohol and a slight dryness in the finish. This beer because of its earthy nature doesnt have to stay on the desert or on the after table. You could serve this with plenty of foods.

THIS moves me like few beers ever have, remarkably, year after year after year. Always different from what I remember, always special. THIS floats my boat. Fruit, spice, something resiney in the background, something dark, roasty, lovely, and bready lurking around, a hard sweet flavor that is positively spatial, and a smooth, silky mouthfeel that goes on for a long, sweet, pleasurable ride.

Poured a mahogany color with 2-3 fingers of frothy off-white head. Well-layered, thick and sticky lacing on the sides. Pretty good retention all the way down.

Smelled heavy malts right from the get-go. Also got caramel, toffee, dark fruits, blueberry, rye and iced tea with a touch of hops. 

First thing I noticed in the taste was how carbonated it was. Once that was done, got some fruits - dark apple, dates, figs, prune - and a bit of a buttery finish. 

Medium body. Sticky texture. Lively (good) carbonation. Long, smooth finish.

4324,"2012-11-17",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2013 (bottle)  Pours a dark red color with a large tan head that holds its form.  Gets the five.  Aroma is reminiscent of gingerbread, stewed plums, with light pine and some citrus that adds an element of freshness to the overall scent, but subdues the malt in the process.  Flavor holds some candied orange, light grapefruit (towards the finish), cocoa, caramel, toasted biscuit, and some dark fruit in the finish. After this hit of dark fruit follows a substantial pithy bitterness that lingers for quite some time.  Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is a touch spritzy.

Way too sweet with toffee then plums and winter spice. It teases because at first its almost nice, but its inappropriately strong. Weirdly reminds me of Lime Gatorade, how?...The taste is equally poor. Its incredily light in taste after how strong the aroma is. The feel is way to light, almost water.

4.0 A: Dark amber color. Two fingers of creamy, but frothy head has average retention and leaves lots of lacing.

3.5 S: Caramel and dark fruits. Pleasant, but not nearly strong enough. I let this warm up for my final evaluation and it just simply wasnt packing any punch.

3.5 T: Tastes like what I can only describe as olde ale light. Dark fruits again, a healthy bitterness (perhaps too healthy), and caramel malts. Good, but perhaps too bitter for the style and the mouthfeel ruins the taste.

2.0 M: Light body, which is exactly what I dont want in a beer like this. Good carbonation. Not very creamy. Mouthfeel sucks.

A light earth and some spices come out more as this warms with a touch of bread and some more dark fruits. Flavor is caramel and brown sugar up front with more of a plummy dark fruit than the aroma. A pretty distinct spicing and hop bitterness comes in the middle and leads this into the finish. A touch of cocoa, some yeast, and a light bread join the ample caramel malts and spicy hops that make up a fairly high bitterness consisting of a mix of pines, earth, and wood. A bit of a toasty pie crust and cocoa increases ever-so-slightly in the hoppy, lengthy aftertaste following a smooth, medium-full body and very soft, somewhat tickling carbonation.

The pour yields a clear body with super dark, inky, garnet-violet shades.  A moderate head of frothy, grayish-khaki foam settles to a thin patch with a bubbly edge.  Minimal lace spotting shows on the glass.  The nose shows the signature Pacific Northwest hop profile of sticky pine resin and softer citrus, with an underlying malt base of dry roasted chocolate, toasted caramel, and maybe some scorched toffee.  Alcohol comes through, but not such that it offends.  Flavors show more of the same, layering dry chocolate, caramel, biscuit, and toffee notes in the base, countered and balanced by ample bitter pine and grapefruit hop notes.  Medium bodied, the palate sports average to active carbonation with a semi-dry consistency and a slightly chalky finish.

Pours a dark, somewhat murky, brown with ruby tinting. One-finger head of light brown, loose foam. Dissipates to a thin covering on top of the liquid. Lacing is foamy and fairly sticky.

A touch of caramel maltiness. Notes of dried, dark fruits. Raisins and figs, mostly. Not really getting alot from this one.

You get a lite kiss of hops first. Followed by some hints of those dried, dark fruits. Then a roastiness comes in, fairly large. Some mild biscuitiness follows. Finishes with a slightly dry citrus taste.

Okay, medium body. A little bit on the lighter side, than Id hoped for.

Overall, I expected more from this one. Its drinkable, but there just isnt a whole lot going on, here. Pretty mild, as far as winter warmers go.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

Bitterness is strong, biting all over the mouth in the finish...mouthfeel is a bit chalky...the fruit cocktail flavors are nice, but I think the bitterness takes away from the fruitiness.

The nose is sweet with lots of caramel and toffee malts, a bit of earthy graininess, and some slightly old smelling leafy hops.   The taste is a bit over the hill and oxidized for being just less than one year old.  The caramel has faded to a bland cardboard quality that is not all that pleasant.  Still a fairly prominent hop bitterness on the back end, but its not the type that adds any snap to the finish.  Medium to full bodied with a bit of a tired heavy finish.

The aroma holds lots of caramel notes and malts.  It is lightly spiced compared to some other beers of the same style, with scents of wooded caramel and perhaps an earthy ginger.  As it warms the hops come out on the nose in a big way. Again and I cant stress enough, caramel is VERY present in this beer.

Pours a dark brown that shows as a deep ruby when held up to the light.  There is an impressive two-finger cream-colored head that sticks to the sides on the way down to a lasting cap.  This is a gorgeous beer.

The aroma is massively sweet with lots of caramel malts, molasses and dark fruit which gives way to some spiciness that lingers in the nose.  I didnt get a lot of hops in the aroma.

There are some earthy hops that open up the taste with a slight bitterness on top of the massive caramel malt backbone that keeps the sweetness going throughout.  The spices come out in the middle and really tingle the tongue in the finish with a peppery zing.

The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied with strong carbonation that leads to a very velvety feel overall.

4324,"2008-06-02",3.1,"I think much stronger juices are in need for instant jubilation, but I immediately take a liking to the carefree package design on this Deschutes beer.  The body is a rich, dark cherry body, clear but very dark.  The head is diminutive, almost puny on such a dark beer body, but throttles the glass in a wicked strong lacing.  Thus, when the lumpy, bubbly and balsa wood colored head slowly pops and recedes, you know very clearly where on the glass it started.  The smell is, at first, dusty and dirty - memories of mountain-biking in Moab surface.  But a little patience yields, cream, truffle, pear juice and orange rind.  The taste is very different, taking a malty, slightly sweet milk chocolate stand.  Add in a touch of grape soda sugar and a slightly overwhelming carbonation and theres my Jubelale.

Light dark fruits lead into a great mouthfeel of molasses and sweet toffee, but its only their for a moment, as the finish is quite dry and bittersweet chocolate, with some cocoa dusting on the tongue.  Great drinkability.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

The flavor checks in with molasses, straw/hay, roast coffee, toast and some bittersweet chocolate.  There is an underlying sweetness but mostly dry roasted bitter with good acidity and a powdery finish.  This beer has a heavy filling feel to it with some noticiable alcohol in the finish.  Good taste but a slow sipping beer only.","El Cerrito, California, USA","rayOfBeer"
4324,"2008-04-11",3.6,"On cask at Horse Brass.  Pours a deep dark reddish brown with nary a sign of a head.  The nose is deeply infused with dark fruits.  Figs, prunes, especially.  Rather sweet.  A light hint of a suggestion of spice, but I doubt theres any actual spice in this.  Very subtle floral hops.  No alcohol character noted, so Im surprised this is called an English strong... but then I see the ABV now!  Flatter thinner mouthfeel, duh, its on cask.  Not as watery as those tend to be.  The flavors are just as the nose suggests, perhaps sweeter.  The prunes take over the figs entirely.  Maybe some raisin.  Some caramel.  No real chocolate, maybe a hint of roast.  Floral hjops pop a bit more.  A tasty yummy beer, but not one Id drink a ton of in a sitting.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Smooth mouthful, a touch sour perhaps but I cant figure that out too well, a touch of warmness and a lot of bitterness which I think draws away from the beer a little. Flavours of dry fruits and molasses, a bit of banana, very nice but not as great as the aroma.

4324,"2008-01-26",4.0,"2007 version poured into a snifter. A pretty aggressive pour results in only a centimeter of light tan head, but I was keeping it very very cold so it may be a function of the temperature. Body is dark brown, and theres no lacing.

Distinct notes of caramel, subtle cherry, nutmeg, raisin, and wood in the nose.

Taste starts out lackluster with a chalky dry character, BUT as the beer warmed it transformed into a very tasty winter warmer. Thatll teach me to serve it so cold. I get notes of caramel/toffee, dark fruit, ginger, piney hops, and a much more subdued dry bitterness than the one I experienced earlier. I also notice a quite woody character.

I was able to land a first batch sixer from Johns Market, and although the label has certainly been better in years past, the beer stills holds its status as a superior Northwest winter ale. Jubelale is a staple winter beer, and I look forward to enjoying it as the weather gets colder!!!","Bay Area, California, USA","doughert82"
4324,"2007-09-23",3.5,"Had this beer on 1/2/2006.  Aroma is a sweet roasted malt scent.  Color is a deep orange brown with good carbonation and nice head.  Taste is rich, roasted and bitter.  Starting with a medium body goes down with a sharp feel.  Finish comes out of this sharp feel with a malty flavor that is backed by a full bitterness then leaves you with a warm feel.  Overall I think its a nice Winter brew but not as balanced as I like a beer.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

Citric zests pralines and dates for a wintertime duet while burgundy drips on pumpernickel bread.

Deschutes Jubelale 2006 pours out a medium to dark brown color.  It has an interesting foamy head with large and tiny bubbes packed together in a moonscape-like design.  It collapses unevenly to form a residual frothy crown.  The lacing is quite intricate and plentiful.  The aroma contains roasted malt, some light fruitiness, and  caramel.  Roasted malt, caramel malt,  and light mocha notes comprise the flavor.  There is also some delicate fruitiness/citrus and mild bitterness as the beer  warms.  It has a dry, cocoa-like finish.  The overall flavor is very controlled, balanced, and pleasing.  Average body and mouthfeel.  This is a very good Winter Ale (probably toward the top of the list) and one of the better Deschutes brews that Ive had.  Sadly, this is just another satisfying beer that isnt available in my area...

Pours dark with orange-red highlights and a nice tan head. 

The aroma is truly superb: baking bread, dried fruits, candied orange, a hint of blueberries, and and a hint of chocolate. Compared to the aroma, the flavor doesnt quite live up. Its good enough - but not an absolute standout as one might have hoped after the first whiff. The  flavor is burnt grains and a bit of molassas and raisin, well balanced with firm, tasty hops that provide a nice bitter finish without ever stealing the show from the malts. The mouthfeel is quite nice, full without being too sticky. 

All in all, a pretty darn nice beer. 9/3/7/14/15=3.8.

Decent aroma, yeasty, orange peel, cola notes, but also some alcohol burn beyond its percentage.

Quite warming in mouth despite the relatively low ABV, slightly oily palate, light-medium body, very low carbonation level. Pleasant spiced dark fruits flavours work mysteriously well with the hops where Id have thought this would bring some undesired astringence. Bready, coniferous and slightly citrusy. No Jubel 2000 deepness, but still one of the best Ive had from Deschutes, more so than their acclaimed dark beers.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The conditions were hard to take notes in but these are the ratings and they stand. Draft. Rich malty and hoppy aroma. Dark and clear brown in color. Flavor is very malty with a slight alcohol warmth. Malty and lightly hopped finish. Good stuff. 

Re-rate: Aroma is full of dark malt and lightly sweetened chocolate with a hint the hops to come. Flavor is caramelly rich and malty but balanced by a decent amount of hop bitterness with hints of that grapefruity hoppiness in the finish. Really nice stuff. The original rating stands.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","MadMan"

4324,"2005-04-06",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2005 (12 oz bottle: BevMo in La Jolla CA) I’m comparing an aged 2003 bottle of Jubelale with a recently-purchased 2004 bottle just to see how this beer compares and holds up.  There’s not much difference.  Both are fairly roasty and chocolaty, and moderately sweet and caramely throughout, with a moderately bitter hoppiness elbowing its way to the stage for the finish.  The chocolate also really comes out in the finish, and is really delicious.  The main difference between the two bottles is the 2003 bottle shows a bit more dominance of sweet and roasty maltiness, and less bitterness in the finish.  Sweet, roasty, caramely, and lightly hoppy nose is about what I’d expect based on the flavor of the beer.  Full bodied and chewy, mildly carbonated, with a fair amount of depth on the palate and a long-lasting and somewhat bitter finish.  The beer is a mahogany color, fully clear and translucent with a medium sized tan head that gradually fades to a thin film, leaving a number of wide rings around the glass that persist long after I’ve finished the beer.  When all is said and done, the newer 2004 bottle is just a bit less rounded on the edges, and so I like the smoother, aged 2003 bottle more.  Either way, though, you can’t go wrong here.  One of the best American winter beers I’ve tasted yet.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

4324,"2004-02-01",3.8,"Color is a rusty orangish brown, moderately deep and clearish with a muted glow, medium smooth tannish head that sits breifly fading to a thick cream colored skim and lots of intricately woven sheets of lace. Aroma has a good caramel top with some underladen tones of dried fruits and hops. Taste is slightly sweet, mild overall with a super fine blend of calming dried hop variants, both dulled and mild fruityness and woodsy sense in the hops. Malts lend the sweetness throughout which come through as well rounded and help keep balance. Finish has a lingering mix of dried hops first then the sweetness returns for a stint eventually breaking away into some light earthy tones, kinda nice in that department. But overall the flavors are short lived and not all that complex, seems a bit one dimensional, if it weren't for the finish this would have been average for me I think. Its very well balanced, but I was looking for more of a boost in the flavor dept. Slight chocolate tones show up as it warms which is a nice surprise.Feel is close to medium body with an overall light sweet twinge and mild dryness thats always mixing and giving way to one another. Pretty decent, good balance, but lacking some boldness and depth of lasting flavors, that said, it still makes for a good sessionable Old Ale, quite drinkable; the 6.7% may be a bit much for many of these though.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Clear garnet with a determined tan head that completely restores with a good swirl.  I get caramel, leafy hop, apple, pineapple, pear, faint roasted malt, spicy alcohol, and earthy yeast on the nose.  Quite candyish in aroma.  The flavor begins with a reasonably complex blend of the fruits from the nose, caramel, and leafy hops.  Midway, a bit of alcohol adds a touch of warmth, then a wave of green hops, roasted malt, burnt fruit, and smoke finishes it off.  Almost sweet and candyish towards the end despite it all.  Some spice, earth, and tree bark appear in the aftertaste.  Medium in body, with a mouthfeel that is washed clean after each sip by the dryness of the alcohol.

Pours with a light brown head.  It is a deep brown color.  As it pours I get notes of raisin and roasty malt aromas, perhaps a hint of banana as well that might be a hop contribution (really hard to tell).  There is quite a bit of fruity - spicy hops in the aroma that seems to have a candy coating.  This beer is quite smooth, a finish that is reminiscent of rum.  Quite good, complex.  Has a finish that is of roast malt and an astringent / slightly alcoholic ending, as well as some balancing hop bitterness.  Fruity notes of raisin and cherry are evident as well.

This brew was redolent with so many different hop notes and a rich, malty, ester-ridden bouqet that I literally sat with my nose in the glass for about 2 minutes. Bold, sweet, malty flavor, citrus hoppiness came in at the beginning of the aftertaste and was followed my another, different onslaught of malt, reminiscent of unfermented wort.

Seemed more like an underhopped American amber with some chocolate malt.","San Jose, California, USA","SaveTheAles"
4324,"2002-12-01",4.0,"Dense, thick head on top of a deep mahogany body.  Brussels lace like theater curtains.  Sourish cherry or green apple aroma.  additional fruits and spices help to fit the seasonal theme well.  Also a kind of roasted nutty finish.  damn good beer.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
4324,"2002-12-01",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2005 2005 - Firstly, we really need to split each annual vintage out into separate beers; they are different recipes and the labels are different. Roasted malt aroma with some type of spice I couldnt identify, but doesnt smell overly holidayish. Clear, ruby red incolor with a large, light tan, almost yellow head. Beautiful. Lots of visible carbonation. Looks Christmasy. Excellent lace. A little overly malty, but by mid glass, the hops come out. Initially, the alcohol profile appears too pronounced, but it mellows at mid glass. Some buterscotch creaminess; not sure if its from diacetyl, but it is nicely done, and really essential to its being a solid holiday beer. 2001 - Moderately malty, heavily hoppy nose with hints of flowers and perfume. Small, creamy, frothy, light-brown head. Excellent brussels lace, although the head mostly diminishes. Dark, black-cherry red body. Moderately sweet with moderate to heavy bitterness. Malt tones are also prevalent, making for a very well balanced brew. Vaguely reminscent of a cherry lambic. Great artsy label; a very good beer overall, though not as good as the SNCA.

4324,"2002-12-01",3.9,"Aroma is sweet and slightly medicinal with hoppy tones...The color is a fine mahogany with a medium head and fine speckled lace...Flavor is a complex bittersweet marriage of sweet and roasted malts, well-blended hops and a light, aromatic spiciness...Carbonation is kept light, adding just the right amount of sparkle...Body is medium-full...This is extremely well-balanced, with a robust flavor profile...This is in the upper echelon of winter seasonals...","Des Moines, Washington, USA","KingPinHead"

4324,"2002-11-25",3.7,"Deep dark color, with spice aroma.  Big hit of molasses, more so than years past.  Nice little bite on the end also.  I have to say I like it better than the 2001, but not the 2000.","Montana, USA","kyzr"
4324,"2002-11-24",3.7,"Syrupy sweet aroma: corn syrup, molasses, hints of spice and spruce.  Flavour is even better - good amount of ethanol, some spice, a bit smokey, nice and malty.  Great for the style.","Pullman, Washington, USA","Merc"

4324,"2002-11-15",3.8,"Brown pour until you hold it to the light. Pretty garnet heart thick tan head. Nice malty nose. Nice balance, a little spiciness. Malty with a clean hop bite coming through near the finish.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"

4324,"2002-11-12",3.9,"You gotta love that nice crusty foam this beer leaves behind. The malt smells wonderful in this beer, it tastes great too. Deep molasses, mild caramel and hops. Palate is very nice due to the malt and the hops keep the Northwest feeling alive. This is a very good beer, and satisfies that ever so specific need I have for warming malt in the wintertime. Who needs firewood when you have this to warm your belly...seriously.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

4324,"2002-11-08",4.4,"Rerate. Numbers are for the 2002 vintage. Deep ruby color, medium foamy head. Rich malt aroma. Tastes very different from the 2001 edition. Rich malt flavor, molasses, spices and spruce. Not as hoppy as the 2001. Chocolate malts and a touch of banana and clove. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste us slightly bitter. Nice and warming. Great for winter evening sipping.  2001 release. Red brown color, medium head. Medium bodied brown ale, nice mild roasted malts. Somewhat hoppy.

4324,"2002-11-05",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2008 A strong, seasonal ale with a nice amber-red color, fruity aroma and fairly smooth taste, though a little flat. Rerate: Akin to a harvest ale/strong ale with its pronounced hoppiness in aroma and flavor. Excellently balanced and smoothened candy malt that is almost, but not quite approaching syrup in consistency. = 3.4 rating.
Rerate: 2007 - Wow! This recipe must change dramatically each year. This is by far the best rendition yet. Amber-orange and small head, a nice looking beer. Unexpectedly spicy-hoppy aroma. Not sure if this is from the hop varieties or from the addition on spices. It melds into the brew extraordinary well, adding delicious complexity in aroma and flavor. Some citrusy notes appear giving way to piny resiny hoppiness, reminiscent of Laconners Tannenbaum Ale. Quite pleasing. Would love to get the recipe.Alcohol is not noticeable as this brew is expertly balanced to create a pure pint full of liquid craftmanship.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
4324,"2002-10-27",4.0,"This is delicious.  I love the spiciness, spruce flavors.  I love how it warms you up.  I think this is one of the best winter beers out there.  Highly reccomended.","Pullman, Washington, USA","Gregory"
4324,"2002-10-27",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2004 This stuff is awesome. Great hops, great pronounced bitterness that doesn't overcome the rest of the beer. Very palatable even for people who have been drinking bud their whole life. 6.7% is nice too. I will drink this stuff until I can't get it anymore, and then save some 6ers for summertime. Nab this beer if you can find it. ReRate 2004: I have one of these from last year that I layed down. Still very carbonated. Aroma is all malt, dry and chocolaty. Excellent mahogany color. Taste is a little off. Still malty with caramel notes, some chocolate malt. Slightly oxidized, but not bad. Drying finish. I would say that this beer does improve with age, but not much.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
4324,"2002-10-25",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2006 Rating #1 Bottle of the 2002 release (8 5 7 3 15).  Mahogany red color with a brown head.  A cherry and red fruit aroma.  A creamy almost sticky palate and a flavor of fruit and chocolate.  Rating #2 - Bottle of the 2001 vintage sampled in May 2003 (8 5 8 4 17).  A very dark red color that looks brown unless held directly to the light.  The nose is great with lots of deep fruits, caramel, and plums.  Chocolate, vanilla and oak in the flavor.  Well hopped but not a pronounced characteristic of the beer.  The nose of a good barley wine with a slighly weaker body and much of the same flavor.  Rating #3 Bottle of the 2006 release (12/8/06) (7 3 7 3 16).  A dark reddish brown color with a light brown head.    A cherry fruit and malt aroma with nice hints of sour.  Smooth, medium body, caramel malts and mild earthiness.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"

Id almost call it the candy winter brew, because the fruity, flavorful taste almost borders on a simple malt beverage, but the hops quickly return it to the beer catagory.

If that looks like an incredible mess of aroma, Id agree but Im finding it appealing with some challenged glee.  Ooh this is nice... Challenging and good. The feel rocks -- soft and round.

Draught @ Papago: 
This magnificent beer pours a transpicuous deep burnished copper color, the head mastodonic in size, spumescent in texture, and the color a winsome tan color, as the head deliquesces, a satiny sheet of lace forms to caress the glass. Big malt laden nose, caramel candy sweet, hints of the hops lay just beneath this delight for the senses, ambrosial start, nicely malt laden; the top has a moderate feel to the palate. Finish is agreeably carbonated, the hops spectacular in their spicy presence, nice droughty aftertaste that lingers on the palate. Each year I await the release of this beer like a kid waiting for his new Christmas bicycle and thanks to Papago Brewery, my most favorite Beer Palace, and Deschutes Brewery one of my top three favorite breweries, I get a double barreled treat, draught and bottles to store away, well we will see how long they stayed stored, the Vegas Line say that the odds are 10 to 1 against them lasting till the next release.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
