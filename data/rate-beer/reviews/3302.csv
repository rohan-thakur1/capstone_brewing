3302,"2017-01-20",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
Apricot jam on madeleine cookies; a most quenching and characterful afternoon treat of a Landbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the misty orange.
-Flavor profile is fresh and juicy.
-Flavor dosage is perfect. By the third pint, youre still enjoying yourself and your palate is not too fatigued.
-Needless to say, drinkability is sky high.
-Such simple, straightforward pleasures are very efficient ways to get a smile on my face.

3302,"2017-01-10",4.2,"On tap at the brewery. Clear amber brown colour lasting cream head. Very good malt good biscuit good apricot. Very full. Dry hops on the finish. Like digestive biscuit with apricot jam. Stayed for 3 beers. Just one of those Franken beers that makes you fall in love with the place.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

3302,"2016-03-09",4.1,"Cask at Akkurat, Stockholm.  Cloudy golden, small head. Grassy nose with bread, hay and peach. Mid dry with medium body and soft mouthfeel. Grassy and minty, dough and hay. Mid bitter finish. Soft, deep and quenchable.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
3302,"2015-07-11",4.2,"Tap @ Hartleb Maroldsweisach. Pours hazy golden with a white head and lacings. Rustic, grassy and juicy hoppy. Grassy green, marmelade and breadcrust. Really soft and smooth. Absolutely amazing! Dry bitter hoppy sticky finish. Bang!","Odense, DENMARK","Dedollewaitor"
3302,"2014-11-12",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2015 Draft at the brewery. Lightly hazed honey gold with a short, quickly dying white head. Malty, honey-ish, mineral-focused, showing Hallertau apricot jam aroma hops well. Sweet, medium body, rich and savory in the mouth, measured bitterness and medium acidity. Remarkably long and savory malt finish peppered by restrained noble hop bitterness. Juicy, sweet and clean, full of savory, filling melanoidins. Its not the most expressive Landbier, but it is lip-smacking and the balance is stellar, allowing it to easily be put down in gulps even with the high sweetness.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3302,"2014-09-16",3.6,"Vom Faß im Brauereigasthof in Maroldsweisach (als Landbier, naturgeklärt und ungefiltert). - Helles Braungold, trüb; reichlicher leicht beigefarbener Schaum. - Mild hefige Nase mit feinem fruchtigem Hopfen (milde Orangenschale). - Antrunk mild hefig (aber keineswegs grün), würzig orangenfruchtig. Leichte Karamelnote, nicht süß. Mild rezent wie ein Ungespundetes; weich im Mund, schlank. Im Abgang würzig pfeffriger Hopfen, kühlende Minze. Nicht besonders bitter, leicht kühl-herb. - Etwas eigenwillig aber erstklassig gehopftes Landbier, mild aber fruchtig, enorm süffig. Noch dazu spottbillig (1,90 Euro für eine Halbe).","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"
3302,"2013-10-15",4.4,"This is the beer I long for. While I live in Los Angeles, I have a home a couple villages away from this Brewpub. Locals, who have a wide variety of excellent beers available to them, love this beer. They dont bottle but are happy to fill growlers for the price of soda pop. Other than the so call Unfiltered Reference Beer at the Pilzner Urquel Brewry Tour, this is my favorite beer to date.","South Pasadena, USA","CSvBibra"
3302,"2011-05-31",3.6,"(draught at the brewpub) Hazy, orange-golden colour with a short off-white foamy head. Moderately sweet and slightly yeasty malty aroma with a tinge of cara-malt, biscuits and herbal hoppy spice. Bitter-sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Quite hearty (cara-)malt character with notes of biscuits, a subtle fruity touch and herbal hops. Moderately dry bitter-sweet finish with rounded malty and herbal hoppy notes. Clean and solid Franconian Keller-/Landbier. 08.XI.10","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
3302,"2009-06-13",3.6,"Draught at the brewpub: Deep golden, hazy with a smaller stable off-white head; solid nose: pale malt and hops, combined with a yeasty fruitiness; moderate to solid sweet-bitter flavour, light to medium bodied; lingering, soft hoppy-fruity finish. Very fine Kellerbier......","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
3302,"2009-05-08",3.9,"Draught at the brewpub. Looked as if there was a town party or something. Refreshing aroma, hint of aromatic hops. Hazy dark golden colour. Stable white head. The flavour is nice and clean, fruity with a good hop spiciness. Very flavourful, yet very drinkable. A very good beer. Probably only good fresh from the tap, but might not be available anywhere else anyway.","Sønderborg, DENMARK","MiP"
3302,"2007-06-29",3.7,"Brewery tap. Blonde, hazy. Hopbitter, flowery, even a bit citric flavor with a hay-like aftertaste. Firm hopcharacter. Excellent, except for the rather bland aroma.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
