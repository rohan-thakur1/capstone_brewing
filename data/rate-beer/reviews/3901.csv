3901,"2016-09-05",3.9,"750, capped. Thanks, N! What an awesome treat. Pours a clear medium pinkish purple with minimal filmy head. Big tangy nose, showing tons of fresh raspberry and a bit of lemon zest. The more fruit sours you try, the less you want to age any of them, because the fresh fruit character is always the best part. This is just explosively juicy and dripping with berry character, and I dont think it was even the most recent release from these guys. Creamy medium body, acidic bite, moderate carb. Sharp attack, showing lots of berries and a bit of lemon zest along with a piercing acidity. Long tangy lightly-bitey finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Aroma is fresh picked rasperries still in the field, along with a lemony sour mash. Flavor follows, medium tart and very fruity, tons of raspberry. I honestly would not even notice a barrel character without reading it in the description; the berries are just too fresh for that. Lightish body, high carbonation.
