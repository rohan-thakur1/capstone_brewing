4285,"2017-04-29",3.1,"Tap at Tavern on the Square. Golden pour. Nose is vanilla and light herbal notes. Tastes of vanilla, some medicinal notes, bready, grass. Sweeter finish. Little watery.","New York, USA","Jow"
4285,"2016-09-10",3.3,"Pale yellow pour with grassy aroma with some bread. Very flavorful with bread, grass, citrus, and honey. Very nice beer for the style. Creamy palate.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","alobar"
4285,"2016-08-14",4.0,"Bottle from Meditrina. Gold with lasting head and lace. Noble hop grassy aroma with a touch of crackery sweet honey malts and white wine. Sweet vanilla honey light crackery malts with grassy mildly spicy bready clean finish with just a touch of lingering earthy hop. Light body soft carbo. Very good/excellent.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
4285,"2016-04-16",4.1,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a transparent golden yellow color with fast rising carbonation to fill a one finger white foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly. Light lacing here and there.
The smell took in sweet grassy hops over top of some sweet bready/German yeastiness, clean and pronounced.
The taste was basically the same with a nice smooth crisp sweet bready aftertaste leading on into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat light on the body with a great sessionability about it. Could pound this all day in the Summer if I wanted to!
Overall, for a dortmunder/helles lager, I really dont care what anyone else has to say, but I loved it for what it is and would definitely love it with some bratwurst. Makes me ready for Summer!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4285,"2015-12-14",3.4,"Yellow. Not an exciting look. Aroma is nearly missing. Just a hint of sweetness. Juicy. Lots of citrus here. Honey, malt backbone is thin and fleeting. Table sugar, creamed corn. Decent","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4285,"2015-12-06",2.5,"Draught at Bukowskis Tavern, 12/1/15.Clear, brass-golden body is topped by a small white head with moderate to low retention.Strong cereals, toasted malts and vanilla notes in the nose are somewhat lightened by grassy-to-herbal hop notes. Do get a bit of sulfur as well, though no alcohol or other flaws.The flavor is full of sweet honey and sourdough notes with vanilla lingering and tons of dried herb-like hop character. Medium to medium-low carbonation is not overly tight and hurts the overall drinkability, allowing the beer to seem even thicker/sweeter than it already is. The light sulfur, heavy vanilla and worty sweetness all lead one to believe that this beer was not given enough time in primary or secondary.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4285,"2015-08-28",3.4,"Draft at the brew pub. Hazy gold color, aroma is lager yeast, pale grain, straw. Flavor has a good amount of the lager yeast and grain with a mild lingering lager Funk. But this is a pleasing thing. Enjoyable","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
4285,"2015-07-02",4.0,"Light straw color with a thin head , s slight sulfur and and skunk flavors, still a slight sweetness to the beer like it didnt have time to finish","","Inertiaman37"

4285,"2015-01-13",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
This slender Helles juxtaposes agreeable cereals and herbal hops in a properly polished mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the bright clear gold.
-Drinkability is obviously very high.
-This is very clean, technically speaking.
-There are very few brewers on the continent whom work on building authentic lagers, so Queen City will undoubtedly be very appreciated by those who like these styles. Now if we can only get full pints at their tasting room instead of drinking from tiny glasses...

On tap at the brewery.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
