3372,"2016-09-07",4.4,"Had this beer several times. Pours clear and golden with a white head. As a fresh ale, under two weeks old, aromas was dominated by citrus fruits. As the beer ""matured"" the aroma fainted a bit and left it with a really nice apricot character. Flavors also became more balanced. A really sessionable beer!","Stavanger, NORWAY","Alexus"

3372,"2016-06-28",3.5,"33 cl, bottle fermented. Light yellowish amber, some chill haze, thin white head, low carbonation. Aroma is loaded with hops. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, but a bit short. Taste is nice and hoppy, but I wish it had a bit more bittering. Very refreshing, must be the perfect rock festival beer, I could easily drink several of these, beeing a weekend warrior in a muddy field on a hot day. Amarillo and Mosaic goes together really well.","Fetsund, NORWAY","Nonshaugen"
3372,"2016-06-27",4.4,"Draught. Low white head. Hoppy and fruity aroma, very dominant. Light in color and moderate clear. Smooth bitterness and a very pleasant hop character. Troipical fruit, citrus, some resin. No push back. Very, very drinkable. All about the hops, just enought malt to back it (somewhat) up. Moderate carbonation lends to the drinkability.","","John76"
3372,"2016-06-21",3.9,"On tap at Bøker & Børst, Stavanger. Pours hazy golden with a small white head.Strong fruity aroma, peach mango and citrus.

3372,"2016-06-07",4.0,"0,33l bottle. 2016. Lovely hoppy aroma. Cloudy and golden with off-white medium head. Fantastic aroma. Hint of pineapple. Sweet. Lightly carbonated. Could have been more carbonated. Mild taste. Very pleasant, but more bitterness would have lifted it further.","Sandsli, NORWAY","asimeow"
3372,"2016-06-07",3.1,"Bottle from Gulating Vestkanten, Bergen. Pours a clear light golden body with a small white head. Nose is huge catty herbal notes, tomato plant, citrus and hints of grass, red fruits and cereals. Taste is red fruits, catty herbal tones, greenhouse plants and hints of straw and cereals. Light body, medium to high carbonation. Too catty for me, but otherwise a drinkable enough hoppy thirst-quencher.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
3372,"2016-06-06",4.3,"Bottle. Pours light golden with light low to none head. A big hop nose of mango and citrus. Softly carbonated. Light bodied and very hop forward. An easy drinker with a very dry finish.","","Mikkmakk"
3372,"2016-06-06",4.2,"This is a great session beer for a summer day. Its moderately yet well hopped. The color is a slightly hazy (unfiltered) golden straw colored. The palate is a little thin for my taste, but this also makes it drink relatively easier, especially when in the heat at the festival it was brewed for. Definitely a strong sessionable beer.","Stavanger, NORWAY","IntlAgBrewer97"
