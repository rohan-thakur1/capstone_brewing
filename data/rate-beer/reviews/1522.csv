1522,"2016-01-17",3.3,"The aroma was not inviting as it was reminding me of the familiar ""C"" hops and I was bracing myself for another American wheat beer with too bitter of a finish. Upon tasting, however, I was more than pleasantly surprised at its greatness. It turns out, that all the hoppiness is in the aroma, which is just fine with me. Nice, medium bodied, pale gold color with some haze and a snow white frothy head. Has more to do with Witbier than Hefeweizen in my opinion, as theres a delicate touch of acidity here that wouldnt exist in most American wheat beers. Enveloped in mild aromas of lemon and grapefruit zest. A very pleasant beer to sip on in any moment or season.","Miami, Florida, USA","MiamiBarman"

1522,"2015-10-28",3.6,"December 23rd, 2013 - Boulevards 80 Acre Hoppy Wheat brings a lot of vivaciousness to a style that often sits and stews in its own, mulling, lazy flavors. The aroma begins with fruits and esters, replete with bananas, and even a touch of a grapefruit. On reflection, this makes a great deal of sense, given the title and style. Also, somewhere on the periphery of the scent, is a little white grape, giving a bit of a boost to acidity and brightness. The flavor is wheaty, but I note this in my notes as ""wheaty?"" The grain touch is lighter than I might have expected, replaced with a custardy banana mush, a touch of pear, and a nice-fruity hops balance. I actually prefer this over the usual cracked wheat flavor, though it might buck style guides.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1522,"2015-01-04",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Lemon zest allusions and herbaceous edges tickle this balanced and very refreshing wheat beer.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam decorates the shiny yellow haze.
-The mouthfeel is cuddly; not too dry, but super soft and easily poundable.
-Wheat creates bready connotations.
-You can almost imagine lactose in here.
-The hop character is harmonious with the rest of the beer and super refreshing (New World citrus allusions).

1522,"2014-10-18",3.7,"Best by: 08/10/14 -- So it is past its best by date. Im pretty disappointed by that.

Appearance: Hazy light golden body with a fluffy white head that stands very well and leaves some spotted lacing.

Aroma: Very fresh hop aroma. Spicy with a bit of earthy bay leaf smell to it. Its very nice.

Taste: More of that spicy earthy flavor to it. It taste a bit like thyme. A hint of mint in the backgrond. I dont get any wheat flavor which is a bit disappointing, and there isnt any perceptible yeast character.

Mouthfeel: Its smooth and light, medium bitterness, and a bit drier than Id expect from a wheat beer...it also doesnt have the presence on the palate that most wheat beers have.

Overall: Despite being past the best by date on the bottle, the beer was good. I think it could be because the store I bought it from kept it refrigerated. The only thing that might identify this beer as a wheat beer to me is by the appearance...there really was no tell-tale sign in the aroma or flavor. The hop aroma and flavors are excellent. If you are an APA fan where you want a lot of hop flavor and aroma but not a ton of bitterness, this is right up your alley. If you dont like wheat beers, dont be turned off by this beer because it doesnt show. If you do like wheat beers, this leaves a lot to be desired. Overall it is a really good beer though, and the framework really relies on the hops...and if it were a house that frame would be made of solid oak.","","teromous"

Poured into a pint glass. 
The appearance was a nice hazy golden yellow to slight lightly tinted orange with a one and a half finger white foamy to slightly bubbly (along the sides). This head died at a nice pace with a slight lacing here and there. 
The smell had a sweet lemon and light wheat and then comes a decent pine to citrus aspect. 
The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors to make a fairly good refreshing satisfaction. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation was exceptionally smooth. Honestly, this beer came across exceptionally smooth and crisp. Is this supposed to be this way?

A: Pours a hazy golden color. A large, foamy white head is formed with three fingers and a soft texture. It fades moderately quickly, and leaves spotty lacing down the glass.

S: There is a decent amount of grapefruit, orange, grass, and lemon notes that betrays a rock-solid hop profile. What Im not quite so sure about is the faint phenolic touch I also pick up. It sadly detracts from an otherwise very good aroma.

T: The flavor reveals lush citrusy notes throughout, and even an initial grapefruit-esque juiciness. It finishes with light touches of grass and lemon, and the dodgy phenols I picked up in the nose is kept in control here. Really likable if a touch mild.

M: I like how lush and creamy this is, helping to keep carbonation in check - and making it a bit syrupy at times. Aside from me wanting a drier finish, this has a very nice feel and great drinkability.

The wheat gives it a smooth, crackery quality which is a perfect canvas for the bitter, citrus hop notes.

1522,"2013-04-07",3.7,"[Bottle] Pours very pale gold with a small white head. Aroma has a blast of citrus up front, which unfortunately quickly fades, leaving behind just dusty wheat. Not that the wheat is bad in the aroma, but it would have paired nicely with sustained hoppiness. The taste has no off flavors, although the alcohol is noticeable as it warms. Not a whole lot stands out, as the taste is definitely malt-driven. A little lemon in the background, and mild bitterness. Very pleasant though. Thin mouthfeel, quite dry, and fairly short finish.  Overall, a beer that I could drink a lot of, especially in the summer. In fact, the extreme sessionability of this beer is winning it some major points.

1522,"2013-01-23",3.6,"In short: A tart and fruity-hoppy wheat base ale.  Very good.
How: Bottle 12oz, consumed fresh one week after purchase from a Kansas store.
The look: Cloudy dark yellow body topped by a medium white head with medium retention.
In long: Nose is dominantly hoppy blending with the fruity esters of wheat beer creating an inviting aroma that is a mix of pineapples, grapefruits and bananas.  Taste offers a very solid wheat backbone, fresh bakery white bread, fresh bananas, sharp bitter grapefruits, hops resin, freshly squeezed lemons, medium yeast presence.  Medium tartness, low-medium bitterness.  My bottle lacked a bit of carbonation which is surprising coming from a mass produced Boulevard 12oz bottle.  The lack of carbonation made the beer feel a bit heavier than it certainly is.  I enjoyed this beer despite the low carbonation and Im sure I would love it with a more active carbonation.

1522,"2012-11-22",3.5,"12oz bottle from a sixer I picked up for $6.99, nice price. Bright yellow-orange color, sort of hazy appearance. Sticky lace, short head. Hoppy, citrusy smell, faintest hint of wheat and crackers. Flavor is slightly citrusy, hoppy, more faint wheat. Id say this is more hop dominated but its not a hop bomb like say Lil Sumpin Sumpin. Its quite easy to drink so

A frothy white head as a good mellow layer laces ok. Sticks around small. Aromas are grassy and lemony hops, fresher lively aromas offer florals, flaked wheat and bready malts. Fairly dry, nice hopping is lively and lemony, grassy. Touches of grapefruit, lemongrass. Initial is lighter end of the fold preaching earthy hops, grass and florals, growing lemon after the initial. Lighter sessionable malt body offers more florals, lemongrass, kiss of gumball and fruity sweetness. Middle is lighter mellow malt body, dry bread, touch of dough. Straw, cereal elements, lighter crisp dry malt elements. Nose grows on me as it warms, offering some melon, citrus, tropical fruit sweetness. Nothing potent, but firm and enjoyable. Flavors are solid if a bit more bland compared to the nose. Lingering dryness, straw and gentle citrus and fruity hops. Its not complex, but its a solid more fruity hop forward sessioner.

Much less hoppy in flavor than aroma, with very little bitterness. Palate is a little heavy for a 5.5% beer with such a crisp aroma and flavor, add the overly light (for this beer), a little bit of chalkiness and it really does a bit of a disservice to the other components, keeping the beer from being as light and refreshing as it should be.

Citric hops backed by a wheaty malt backing, the hop flavor lingers in the finish without the lingering bitterness you get from an IPA (or an APA for that matter). This is an interesting beer, I cant think of any other ""hoppy wheat"" beers, that Ive tried, where the hop presence is so pronounced in the nose and flavor profiles but so conspicuously absent on the palate. Without the tongue-squeezing bitterness of a Gumballhead or Schneider-Brooklyner collaboration, this may not fill-the-bill for someone craving hop bitterness, but it is definitely one of the most flavorful and sessionable wheat beers on the market, today.

1522,"2012-09-01",4.0,"Nice looking wheat beer.  The head was two fingers and lasted forever, leaving sticky lace.  The beer is pretty much like their regular wheat beer in color and clarity, tan and fairly cloudy.  I suspect theres overlap in the recipes, but not just from the appearance.  

The aroma is quite hoppy, also bready, with a little fruit and wheat too.

Taste is a bit odd, but delicious.  It really tastes like boulevard wheat with a bunch of hops in it.  Its got yeasty notes, wheat, citrus, grassy hops, malt, lots of good stuff in there.

Body is typically wheat beer, light and easy to drink, but almost chewy with body.  A lightly sweet, hoppy aftertaste denotes the finish.

Its definitely a very different beer, and I like it.  Wonderful for summer laziness.  Ill definitely be drinking this one again.  Great value too.","Texas, USA","alcaponejunior"

Im surprised they managed to get higher alcohols out of such a basic low/med-alcohol brew, but the gasoline odor is distinctive and very off-putting.  Its not apparent right at first, but after only a few minutes in the glass it comes out and gets stronger with time.  And no, its not the room, my glass, hand/arm, or upper lip, I made sure of that.  That aside, this simply uses raw hop odor to try to make things interesting.  Sadly for me, I find the resinous type of hop aroma crude and non-enticing.  So even without the petrol stink, this wouldnt score too much higher...maybe a 5 for aroma. Looks nice though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Not too dissimilar from its unfiltered parent brew, cloudy gold/straw color with a thin white head (kinda hard to form in a 3-4oz sampler) with a faint nose of green wheat.  Flavor and finish are kicked up from the original unfiltered with a sharp hint of lemongrass (or just lemons) as the citrusy hops.  Finish is more bitter than the original, as expected, but not what you would call a seriously hopped pale ale...just a nice twist on the usual wheaty summer classic for Kansas Citians.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

Aroma holds no real surprises, with plenty of citric, fruity hop, lemon, faintly grainy, wheat malt and very slight esters in the background.  Thoroughly cloudy golden color, with a fine, lasting head, really doesnt appear to be any different than the standard Wheat.  Flavor is decently hopped as well, again with an overt citrus character from beginning to end, paired with a distinctly wheaty malt base, this showing through primarily at the finish, which is dry and fairly refreshing.  Some lingering leafy hop character here as well.  Bitterness is fairly light, surprisingly.  Body is light-medium, palate is creamy and effervescent.  Nicely balanced and refreshing.

Flavor of floral hops, lemon and grapefruit citrus, pineapple, sweet malts, banana, wheat, and a little bit of a clove-coriander spice. The hops emerge a bit more in the flavor than in the nose.
