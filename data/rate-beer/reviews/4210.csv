4210,"2016-11-06",3.8,"Poured into a pilsener glass, the appearance was a deep, dark copper color with a decent transparency and a two finger white foamy head.
The aroma takes some raisin, toffee, earthiness, dark fruits and some grassiness. The taste is basically the same with some caramel, and coffee beans added. Dry roasty to malty sweet aftertaste with the same finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good for what it is.
Overall, good Dunkelbock by Portsmouth. I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4210,"2015-03-13",3.8,"Bomber from the brewpub. Pours a deep, dark copper, clear, with a large foamy tan head. Good head retention. Aroma of raisin, toffee malt, mild earth and dark fruits. The taste is caramel, toffee, toasted malt, raisin, dark fruits and a bit of coffee. Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
4210,"2014-03-08",3.6,"Bottle from the brewery store labeled Bock Lager.
Pours a crystal clear reddish brown color with a huge creamy tan head that slowly recedes to a cap on top. Aromas of caramelized sugars and brown bread with some faint floral hops deep underneath. The flavor is sweet sugary malt with a bit of a burnt edge to it. Light dark dried fruits and a hint of earth round out the flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet touch of syrup mouthfeel. Nice drinker but needs a decoction or something to make it a bit more interesting.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
4210,"2014-03-07",3.3,"Pours mahogany into a snifter. Off-white head with medium retention recedes to hug rim leaving scant spiders. Sweet caramel and earthy nut aromas. Dry with bitter toast and caramel front to back and through the lasting molasses finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
4210,"2014-03-06",3.6,"22 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery gift shop. Pours a sort of clear reddish brown with a 1/4"" of dense beige head. Some lace. Caramel malt aroma with some yeasty notes. Sweet flavor. Lots of malt and brown sugar. Dark wheat notes. Full bodied and creamy. Nice drinking brew.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"
4210,"2014-02-24",3.3,"22 oz. bottle purchased at the source. Dark brown color with light retention around the glass. Aroma is sweet, malty, caramel and dark sugar.

4210,"2010-11-10",3.7,"22oz bottle.  Pours a mostly clear toffee brown with a 2 finger thick off white head.  Nose was quite roasty and held some dried dark fruits.  Very soft with an unassuming finish, pretty tasty.","San Diego, California, USA","Snojerk321"
4210,"2010-10-11",3.8,"Quite dark - I almost thought my order got switched with the stout.  Very rich, fairly sweet and malty with a thick, rich mouthfeel.  Good amount of hops keeps it from being cloying.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
4210,"2010-10-10",4.0,"On tap at brewery.  Dark pour with one finger head.  Surprisingly cocoa flavored, dry with a slightly bitter finish.  A fruity sweetness was not overpowering, making this a wonderfully drinkable brew.  More roasty and cocoa based than most bocks, but nonetheless one of the more enjoyable that IÂ’ve had.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
