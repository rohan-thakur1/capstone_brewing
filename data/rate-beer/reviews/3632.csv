3632,"2017-05-13",3.5,"Can at home. It pours hazy reddish - brown with a medium beige head. The aroma is malt - driven, brown bread, toasty, toffee, Scottish tablet, wood, cereal and earth. The taste is soft, sweet, some bitterness, toffee, fruit cake, dull spice, gingerbread, earth, tannin and leather with drying finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Good malty bitter. Works very well with a whisky on the side!","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
3632,"2017-04-06",3.6,"Can from Drinkmonger. Murky amber/brown body with a medium off-white head. No visible carbonation. Good lacing. Aroma of toffee, stewed tea and crème caramel. Flavour of dried grass, apricot and blood orange. Thin body with a watery texture. Weak fizz. Good flavour for the strength. I think this would be great on cask.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","jamestulloch"

3632,"2017-01-23",3.6,"Dark amber beer, thick creamy head. Looks perfect. Smells of bitter hop and a touch of citrus. Creamy mouthfeel. Taste is light, sweet citrus, easy-going malt and a hint of bitter hop. Sweet, fruity aftertaste without being sickly.","SCOTLAND","ianwelby"
3632,"2017-01-19",3.6,"On cask at the Stockbridge Tap. 
Appearance - dark brown with orange chinks. Nice off white head.
Nose - hazelnuts and sweet malt. Something fruity too. Maybe oranges.
Taste - nuts confirmed and definitely oranges.
Palate - light to medium bodied with a creamy texture and a long dry finish. 
Overall - more of a fruity brown ale than a heavy Id say. Good though.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
