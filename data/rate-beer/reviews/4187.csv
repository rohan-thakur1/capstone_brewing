4187,"2015-07-03",3.6,"Bottle, picked up a few weeks ago in Corvallis. Now that its the height of summer it seems a good time to crack this. Clear deep dark pour with lovely dense creamy head, though not much for lacing. Aroma brings cola, caramel, and some dark fruit. Taste is moderately sweet, but finishes dry enough. Light bitterness. Palate: light+ body, slick texture. Overall: Probably better to consume this closer to winter, but solid even these 6 months later.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
4187,"2015-06-05",3.8,"22 oz. bottle about 5 months old. It pours a deep ruddy, reddish brown color with a small khaki head. The aroma jumps out initially with some dry cocoa powder, rich bread and bread crust, mild fruity raisin, plum and red grape. Fruitiness comes out more as it warms. The flavor has more fruity, light caramel sweetness, rich bready malt, mild hints of cocoa and roast that mingle with some earthy bitterness in the finish. Very smooth, soft mouthfeel with low to medium acidity. Nice toasted, bitter finish. Another tasty lager from Heater Allen.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
