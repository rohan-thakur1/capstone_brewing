2243,"2015-05-17",3.4,"At the Mort Subite café in Brussels, where this brand is obviously cultivated to a high degree, seen the history behind it. Thin, snow white, quickly opening but still fairly stable head - the fact that this even has a head to begin with, reveals that it is not home made like faro should be in its authentic form. Deep, clear, pretty orange blonde colour. Aroma surprisingly still shows quite some lambic funkiness and complexity; hints of orange, artisanal cider, peach, sherry, dry white wine, wood, wet leather and hay. Soft acidic taste, citrus peel touch, mitigated by candi sugar sweetness as expected, caramelly too, sourish drought does continue though, paired with somewhat sticky, but not too disturbing sugariness. Not the most authentic faro, that much is clear, but it does retain a certain lambic character more so than most other industrial bottled faros.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

The aroma offers up mild yet inviting soured notes and yeastiness that quickly gets pushed aside by apple juice sweetness and ripe red apple wedges. The taste, boy they serve this cold, delivers first a modest tart bite that seems a little tannin apple skin like. It then runs into apple sweetness and drying vague mild tartness.

Sat near the entrance and people watched as I sipped this sweet and sour blend of a beer.

The beer is a murky concoction of a red blonde/copper colour, the head biege.

The smells are sugary with some tartness thrown in for good measure. The aroma leads you towards thinking the fermentation isnt quiet over: the taste hints at this too.

More sweet than sour, but an interesting mixture of flavours, especially if you have a sweet tooth like myself.

This was my first faro lambic, and I really enjoyed the mild sourness and sweeter start to it. Flavor starts with a sweet fruit, then fades to a tart and mild sour finish with a bit of wild character. Kinda earthy and dry but overall refreshing.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
2243,"2006-10-19",1.4,"Draught at Mort Subite Café.  Clear amber body with only a little ring of bubbles.  Aroma of sugar candy.  Taste is sugary and fake, like some kind of red flavoured soft drink.  A tad sour and thats it.  I wish sudden death upon this mort subite.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2243,"2006-07-30",4.1,"Draught at Mort Subite. My first faro. Beautiful, slightly dark copper. Lots of candied sugar in the aroma, alongside a hefty dose of lambic funkyness. Flavour and palate is tartness and sugar. Seems that the sweetness is in very good balance with the sourness of this beer. Quite complex. Positively surprised.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","lgklotet"

Consumed at Mort Subite, Brussels, May 2006 Clear, thin, filmy toast colored head.  Dark golden burnt copper colored body.  Instately tart and acidic apples and cider hits the tongue, with some sweeter sugars showing up subsequently.  Fizzy, lightly sour, more cider-like than anything... maybe even soda-like in texture.  Finishes with very sweet apples and candy sugar, with a touch of caramel as well.  Good, refreshing, drinkable, but drinks like a cider or soda, not lambic. Even has some light apple vinegar aromas when it warms up slightly.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Nose is fruity with cherries and wild berries, sweet but balanced, even with some chocolate notes. Taste is fruity with caramel and brown sugar. Surprisingly complex and well balanced. Actually a lot better than expected.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"

Like a mild geuze, not bad. Flavor is extremely sweet and sugary at first glance but then a nice sourish lambic chraracter shows up underneath the sweetness. Still to much sweetness, but with a nice middle and a good tart finish. Not excellent, not bad either.","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"

Tartrique, lactique et légèrement boisé, un vague souvenir de lait en poudre maccompagne à chaque nouvelle gorgé.  Finale légèrement métallique.

Very easy drinking beer, and although the first few sips reveal little complexity, gradually you get the sense of a well oiled machine at work (what does this mean??)

Brilliant balance as the sugar cuts through the lambic notes (as opposed to their regular Gueuze, which is vice versa).  Awesome faro, which the sarcastic might say stems from Keersmaekers extensive experience at adding sugar to lambic.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

Taste is very sweet with a nice touch of oak at the end. The taste is somewhat similar to the kriek.
