It's got a sour lemon to it and a nice complexity in the yeast. It's light and crisp. I love this.

3810,"2016-01-06",3.9,"I cant say enough about how excited I am to be able to try this. When my trader let me in on what she was sending as a trade, I was really eager, but now that Ive peeled back the cap, Im even more thrilled.
- The aroma is delicate without being light; the wine-laden oak is predominant and the spicy dough underneath is a gorgeous foundation. The cloudy lemon brew is capped with a fingers depth of soft, off-white foam and as I sip at the brew, those flavors in the aroma come alive.
- A bit tart, sere and striking in lively elegance, this dances across my tongue. The citrus is actually a bit tangy and adds to the dryness, but the bite is teasing, if not sincere. The taste is pleasantly sour, a bit funky on my tongue, but very nicely so. The subtlety of this is delightful, but its not withdrawn, and not mild. Its a powerful beer, despite the delicacy, and it brings to mind a quote from one of my favorite Shakespearean works. Though she be but little, she is fierce!","USA","lightbias"

A - Since this was stored upright for almost 6 months, its a beautiful straight up gold appearance with a 1 finger head that fades to a small bubbly line that just remains.

S - Smells like straight up Arthur...like Arthur with 6-9 months of age. a little wine, a little oak, a great bright european hop bitterness with a really great malt presence. 

T - Taste, yeah its an 80% Arthur with 20% Anna each with 18 months of age on them. Great oak presence, lacto, brett L and a delicious wheat body with an exceptional backbone with really good tartness of lemonness. I think the bitterness is great as well. This rocks.

M - Good dense mouthfeel, its really great, resilient. Explosive mouthfeel with good carbonation

O - Im really enjoying this one. A top-tier saison for sure. but honestly, a 2 year Arthur saison is as good.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

3810,"2015-06-12",4.5,"My Bottom Line:
This Barrel-Aged Saison presses citrus fruit into white wine, a mélange bursting with freshness thanks to sparkling effervescence, refreshing acidity and intelligent balance.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the hazy yellow-hued white.
-This is both elegant and complex. Great job.
-Straw and hay are tasted after the fruitiness.
-Barrel job is professional.
-This Saison is in the same flavor and texture family as Hill Farmsteads.

Aroma is light citrus rinds, moderate Belgian yeast character of spice and pepper as well as light barrel/white wine nuances. There is a very light funky note, but mostly the beer gives of a very traditional Saison aroma. The beer pours slightly cloudy golden color with minimal head and retention. Taste is up front citrus, distinct Saison yeast character of peppery spice, some dough, light floral quality, faint pear and white wine. Lots of oak on the palate as well. Body is on the lighter side with medium-high carbonation and dry finish. After taste is lightly tart with lemon and more yeasty spice. The beer was very different on draft at the Firestone Walker Invitational. Lots of sour lactic apricot and sweet tarts on the aroma and taste. Mineral water, lots of stone fruit and oak.
