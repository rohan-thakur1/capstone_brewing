2362,"2015-03-13",3.9,"Much better than I remembered. Quite syrupy on the palate but this beer has a nice richness to it that makes it very pleasant to drink.","NEW ZEALAND","omega"

2362,"2015-01-24",3.6,"Bottle. Clear deep amber with a large pale beige head. Aroma of toffee, pine, grapefruit, pepper. Full bodied, moderate carbonation. Sweet toffee, sticky bread crusts, raisins, some Tropical fruit . Some citrus pokes though but its a bit buried. Pepper and pine chop through. Fairly bitter finish. Hearty stuff thats nicely lifted by aromatics and firm bitterness.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
2362,"2015-01-15",4.2,"Massive citrus,pineapple, and piney hops. More hop punch than a lot of DIPAs with higher ABV. I usually find the malt backbone of ambers to be a bit toffee sweet or cloying but this is perfect. A hint of rye like spice, slight nuttiness and a balanced bitterness finish this delicious beer off very nicely.","AUSTRALIA","Soupoftoday"
2362,"2014-12-24",4.4,"huge burnt nose, really hoppy and boozy. rich full palate with lots of body and good rolling carbonation, flavour packed with dried fruits and caramel and big rich finish. looking forward to the next bottle i get","","nezzapunk"
2362,"2014-12-19",3.3,"I thought this was very peaky, lots of hoppy bitter up front, fairly warm in the middle and the finish started neutral and the not dryer. Im not sure that this style is something that I enjoy or understand though. It should be taken with a foods to settle it and balance as on its own its just a bit full of itself in a meddled way.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
2362,"2014-11-13",4.1,"I cant imagine drinking this with a meal. It IS a meal: the body is thick like bangers and mash. The bangers and mash are drowning in a thick gravy of rye-like spiciness, caramel and roasted peanut skins, then the back end comes on like a dessert with sweet citrus and floral tones. This beer really improves as it sits in the glass, but by the time I realised this, I had polished most of it off. Ill definitely get another bottle.","North Shore, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","DylansDad"
2362,"2014-07-22",3.5,"Tap at Mane Liquor. Pours clear ruby red with a small beige head on top. nose is full of pineapple, resin and citric zest with a load of toffee throughout. Taste is very tropical with emphasis on lychee and stewed pineapple, some heavy toffee and resinous notes with a sweet floral kick to it. Very hoppy and sticky sweet. Goes well with the hot food sitting in front of me. Solid drop","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"
2362,"2014-07-20",4.2,"1L Squealer. Pours a clear red/amber hue with a fluffy off white head. Lots of sweet grapefruit and toffee in the aroma. A explotion of citrus as this beer hits the tongue along with a strong bready/toffee malt that counter the intense bitterness perfectly. What an amazing beer!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Brenhophead"
2362,"2014-05-27",4.4,"On tap at Scratch Bar. This is a very very good amber. Hits the spot and is certainly is epic.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
2362,"2014-05-04",4.1,"Lovely ... Not to noticable the addition of chillies , but I guess thats what makes this beer work... The subtle flavour there makes it balance out ... To something a bit different ,without going over the top. Growler gone in no time.","","Kingsolomon"
2362,"2014-03-25",4.6,"Im biased towards ambers so its always going to be hard for me not to like the nice caramel presence this beer features. The beer is perfectly balanced with sweetness, bitterness and hop flavour. Epic does great beers.","NEW ZEALAND","kiwi_daz"
2362,"2014-03-20",4.0,"I sampled this with great thanks to the chaps from Fiasco Brewing at Pomeroys. This is certainly a good looking beer - clear and coppery with a bright white head despite being poured a little too cold. The aroma is just as bright with good spruce and nectarine, apricots and pecans. It was herbaceous, orchard and resinous to taste with the standard fuck-ton on hops bringing on a lengthy and rewarding bitterness. There was good bonding between alcohol and flavour, so this pint felt balanced and flavoursome without being an alcoholic knock-out. Between this pint and the company, I was sorry I couldnt have stayed for another.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
2362,"2014-03-08",3.7,"Definitely calmer than the usual/expected Epic (sic) hop-bomb. Probably a little too strong for those who like a lot of chilli - but likely spot on for those that do not.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
2362,"2014-02-27",3.4,"On tap at skysport grill. Pours copper colour with tan head. Aroma is of sweet floral hops with slight caramel notes. Taste is sweet almost fruity intially and then later its more bitter and nutty. Aftertaste is bitter and the sweetness and dryness keep you going back for more. Nice lacing. Great service at this place for a change and the beer isnt served too cold.","Auckland Central, NEW ZEALAND","Brodies_Best"
