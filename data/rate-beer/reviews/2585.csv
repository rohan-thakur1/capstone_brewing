2585,"2015-09-20",3.1,"Old Odense Ale is a collaborative brew as Sam Calagione from Dogfish Head have participated in. The ale is made by an old receipt from Odense in Denmark, and it contains lots of spicy notes. Its a bit difficult to put names on the spices.
It smells very little of the familiar musty aroma of wet horse stables, as wild yeast Brettanomyces are known for. It is very vinous while mouthwatering ale that are very varied in its taste. Acid is high, but in a pleasant way in which it works mouth-cleaning and does not leave long tasting notes in the mouth afterwards. It is surprisingly fresh and comfortable.","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"
2585,"2013-12-15",3.7,"Bottle shared at Daves tasting. Pours a very hazy reddish brown with a tan head. Pleasant aroma of figs and caramel but really not much else. The flavor is more complex than the aroma suggests with a touch of balsamic vinegar, figs, dates, and caramel. Very nice. Mild-moderate bitterness at the finish. A touch of alcohol at the finish as well. Enjoyable.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

2585,"2013-07-28",3.7,"20.3oz bottle, shared by Caterwaul. Code on bottle reads ""TAP 140208 MHT 110210"" - dont know what that means, but this is probably at least several years old. Totally hazy red / brown color. Thin, bubbly, sort of beige colored head. Dots of lace. Interesting, potent aroma. Big raisin, fig, cranberry. caramel malt. Blackberries and spice, much more noticeable in the flavor, with a hint of maple syrup as well.. Makes me think of pancakes a bit, but much more herbal, bitter, and spicy. Theres a pretty impressive level of bitterness here, moderate to stronger bitter. A somewhat acidic balsamic vinegar overtone to it all, pretty assertive. Impressively tart, too. Medium body. Kind of crisp, lighter carbonation, lightly dry texture. Pretty tasty gruit, very flavorful and complex. I liked it much more than expected.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

The taste is interesting as well and layered with twangy fruits and barnyard snap, spicy notes, earthy smoky and peaty notes and a base of sweet syrupy malt. This is one of those magical beers where the wild sourness actually works and make it a joy to drink. Let say I am digging this... I am not too sure if I bought another bottle it would be the same but I can only rate what is in front of me. Yet another of those Danish brews that are not on everyones wishlist but far exceeds my expections.

Taste is nothing but boring, this is a tasty beer, almost intense.  Sour grapes, honey, tree sap, vinous feeling, barnyard character, medium sourness, and I could go on and on  Basically this is a bunch of not-cohesive flavours thrown at me as hard as possible.  This is not a good beer, really not, yet I found it captivating and I can imagine drinking a full pint of this stuff, making faces after every sip trying to figure what the hell this is.

Overall the flavors are well-balanced and this beer is extremely easy to drink.  I would call this a ""session sour"" if such a term existed.  Some of the herbal quality comes through in the finish.

2585,"2008-11-16",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
This iconoclast of a strong ale presents a sensuous body in which dried white raisins, tart tropical fruit, wild, coniferous needles and bulky honeyed sweetness somehow work in unison. As memorable as it is curious, this one has to be sipped thoroughly to be understood.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the cloudy amber.
-Blended with honeyed sweetness, the sour fruit notes in the nose become strange.
-The wild, grassy notes taste like a cross of brettanomyces and pine.
-Tartness mostly shows up in the last half of the flavor profile, which works well, while being unexpected from the first front of the stip.

Nose is interesting to say the least; it is very hard to find every flavor but certainly the faint anise is there, maple as well, vanilla, herbs are soft and reminding me of thyme or rosemary, and an earthy-woodsy flavor which may be fir?  Underneath theses flavors is the sour notes of blackberry or red currant?  Flavor is surprisingly tart to begin with similar fruit notes of blackberry and overripe raspberry but a subtle earthy-woodsy flavor creeps in (fir bark?).  Very subtle spices find there way by the finish including thyme, maybe sage, and faint white pepper.  Very faint maple and anise also noted throughout.  Palate is medium, silky, nearly lively, and just a bit dry.  Finishes average, lightly dry, spicy with white pepper, lingering tartness, herbs and earthy wood disappating, and lingering faint maple note.  Wow, the ratings for this one are not a reflection of the beer itself.  The nose is much sweeter than the tart flavors on the tongue.

This smells like an old ale as I pour this as it makes me think of aged, oxidized malt.  The beer, when vigorously roused produces an almost two finger thick, fairly quickly dissipating, light tan colored head.  The beer is a red-amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, orange, dark copper hue when held up to the light.  A deeper inspection of the aroma yields an intense, berry like fruitiness, sweet spice notes and a woody-spice / herbal note towards the end.  The perceived Old Ale oxidation, that I noticed as I was pouring this beer, seems to have been a by-product of the particular aromatic components (which was actually sort of what I expected).  The fruit character in the nose is just really intense and along with the sweetness seems to dominate a lot of the complexity that might be more noticeable otherwise.

Wow, the taste was a bit different than I was expecting.  The beer is much drier, almost devoid of sweetness, than the sweet, fruity nose would have suggested and it is actually quite tart as well.  The tartness works with berry-like flavors towards the middle and finish, though the berry notes are not anywhere near as intense as in the aroma.  I would describe the fruitiness in the flavor as a mix of plums, cranberries, blackberries and tart currants.  This has a certain viscousness to it that belies how dry this tastes; I would almost say that the nice tartness helps to mask a bit of sweetness that might otherwise be noticeable.  The finish has a light herbal note to it that seems mostly masked by the noticeable, but not overwhelming tartness.  As the beer warms up, and gets more towards room temperature, some of the sweetness becomes more noticeable, which definitely accentuates a bit more of the berry like fruit notes.

While the flavor is most noticeably tart, this beer is actually quite well balanced and easy drinking.  I can’t help but think this is a bit unnaturally clear, but the head retention is only medium anyway (perhaps from the same cause).  I really like that the intense fruitiness in the aroma, does not drive the flavor to be one dimensional.  Perhaps a bit subtle in its herbal character for a Gruit, but I have a feeling this was true of the true Gruit ales anyway; with the sourness, there is just enough herbal notes to provide a balance for the sweet & fruity notes.  Quite tasty & I would be quite happy drinking quite a bit more of this.

Hints of tart berries, dry and mildly acidic, soft hint of strawberry in there as well. Sweeter up front sort of like a flemish brown, but without the darker malt flavors, more siding fruity-sweet.

Lots of citric tartness, sweet and sour notes, and pine in the aroma; nicely soured and intriguing, foresty notes.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: loads of sour citrus, lemons, pitty grapefruit and piney notes upfront; nice oily, tart density in the mouth; carbonation is relaxed; intricate, strange, challenging beer; seems cohesive overall, clearly presented.

Sour-sweetish aroma with lots of berries and fruit, plus cough-syrupy anise and licorice. Very original, fruity and anisey flavor with some lambic-style sourness, sweetish berries, vanilla, hints of tarragon, and low bitterness. Hides the ABV completely, but warms a little. Medium-bodied and slightly sticky with low carbonation - very easy to drink, yet a bit thin. This was pretty weird in December, but now (5 months later) the tartness has grown, flavors blended, and balance improved. Belgian Old Ale is quite an accurate style description. Also reminds me a bit of Innis & Gunn Rum Cask.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"
