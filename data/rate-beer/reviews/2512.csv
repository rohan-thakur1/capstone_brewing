2512,"2012-08-21",3.9,"Smell is so and so with tropical fruits hidden behind a grassy and murky aroma. Apperance is beutiful with a semi-transparent golden hue and a crisp, white head. Taste is bursting with passion fruit and mango together with a lemony tang to it. The beer is surprisingly thick on the palate and the high carbonation only adds to its refreshing taste. Overall its probably one of the best low alcohol beers Ive ever had the pleasure to try.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pundarquartis"
