3816,"2017-06-01",4.7,"Bottle, extremely generously shared by a non-RB friend from his cellar. This is spectacular. Every aspect of this beer comes together just right. Its full of distinct flavors, with a light, farmhouse funk that brings out apple and grape flavors, a moderate sourness that accentuates the fruit notes, and a big oak hit from the extended barrel aging. And the blending was done superbly -- it builds and improves on each individual component of the blend. I rank this right up there with some of the best beer Ive ever had, from anywhere in the world.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3816,"2017-05-11",4.1,"Side project is finally living up to the hype. This one is great, lots of complex berries, spices, herbs and grassy flavors, very light tartness and then wheat and grains. A little dusty too.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"

3816,"2017-02-07",4.2,"750 ml bottle at Side Projects new brewery. Pours a cloudy gold, vivid, with nice depth and a small eggshell white head that settles into a bit of film, a ring, and some trailing lace, leaving a few spots in the glass. Notes of grapes, lemon, some stone fruits, oak, vanilla, florals, grass, lighter funk, minerals, and faint straw. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a funky, tart mouthfeel in gorgeous balance. Excellent. Almost drinks in layers.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3816,"2016-10-13",3.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kellys Island Bottle Share on September 18. 750 mL bottle in a blind tasting. Blend 1. The pour is a darker cold color with a thick white head and a good bit of soapy lace as it falls down. The aroma is somewhat bland. There is a light citrus grassiness going on, and maybe some light oak. This is incredibly delicate, and yet bland at the same time. The flavor mimics. There is a pretty good funkiness to it, but its pretty obvious that this is a type of saison that Im not crazy about. Its just light and everything that Im not really looking for in a saison. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a little softer carbonation and a lingeringly yeasty and dry finish. Its decent, but not my jam.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3816,"2016-10-13",4.3,"Bottle thanks to Russell. Pours a cloudy orange gold with frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is strong funk, lemon zest, oak. Thin body, oak, funk, lemon, apricot, nice tartness, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3816,"2016-09-25",4.8,"Bottle shared with a friend. Poured a beautiful deep dark golden colour with a white head. Such an amazing aroma, soft sweet citrus notes, melon, ripe pineapple, soft sweet wine notes, oak, light soft grain notes, light farmhouse style Saison. Amazing delicate flavour. So many layers. Perfect dry aftertaste. One of the best saisons i have had. Almost on pair with Hill farmstead ann. Amazing","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
3816,"2016-09-12",3.8,"First drink at FoFa! Pouring a clear brass with a soft wheat spice candy and funk aroma. The taste was acidic tart funk and oak. Good 3.8","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
3816,"2016-08-01",4.1,"Merci à Rémi pour le partage! Liquide plus ambré que blond coule dans mon verre. En sy déposant, celui-ci forme un onctueux collet mousseux qui se marie à merveille à labusif waxing présent dont est affublé cette prestigieuse bouteille. Nez très fidèle au style qui présente de fines notes vanillées - résultat de divers vieillissements habilement amalgamés. Funk léger et délicat tant au nez quen bouche, salliant à merveille à une texture crémeuse des plus délicates. Quelques notes de raisins verts dénudés de toute acidité, dagrumes de gousse de vanille et de pain frais. Une bière toute en subtilité que je me dois absolument de déguster à nouveau, peut-être un jour...","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3816,"2016-07-25",4.0,"Bottle (Blend #1). Yellow pour with white head. Lemon bouquet. Lemon, citrus, barrel, oak, malts, and muted vinegar notes. Really tasty. Complex with a good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
3816,"2016-07-25",3.9,"750 mL bottle. Hazy orange body. Smells intense. Lots of oak. Citrusy. Heavy white wine. And more oak. Tastes equally oaky all the way through. Acidic citrus by way of lemon and orange. White wine is strong too. Really, every flavor is strong. Its an intense saison. Medium body. A white wine barrel tart saison is more of a subtle creature, but this one is strong on all fronts.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3816,"2016-06-22",4.2,"Yellow, white head. Nose is lemon, vinous, minerals, fresh water. Taste is vinous, lemon rind, minerally, light tartness. Love how this one isnt overly acidic like most other Side Project bottles.","","knickskicks"

3816,"2016-05-27",4.0,"Poured a hazy golden color with a white head. Aroma was of light funk, minerals, oak, lemon juice. Lfaovr similar, but not quite as well refined as some of the HF saisons. Best Ive had from them, which doesnt say much.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"

3816,"2016-05-15",4.2,"Ok SP, you did good this time. Totally toned down the acidity and bumped up that mineral quality that I like so much. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a white head. Aromas of lemon juice and crushed up chewable vitamins. Taste is medium high acidity. Not enamel stripping like other SP. Mineral taste. Nice.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Art"
3816,"2016-03-19",3.9,"750ml. White wax B1. Cloudy yellow. lemon, buttery. Sourness is very light and refined. Very balanced and palatable. Almost no acidity. Has the flavor of saison du fermier, but much lighter and more palatable. More like a really good Belgian saison opposed to the warhead acidic sour that Im used to from SP.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
