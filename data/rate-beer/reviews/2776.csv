Pours a pleasant deep amber with a good sized white head that did try to stay but failed somewhat. Aroma was of malts, semi-sweet caramel, dark fruits and a toffee hint in the background. The taste would too sweet for some but my wife and I really took to it. So much more interesting flavour wise than the Pilsner/lager/dunkels we had tried before this brew.
