1330,"2015-12-23",3.7,"Tall boy can from a trade. Nose is immediate coffee, smelled right when opening the can. Raw coffee bean aroma, lightly ""green"" but not vegetal. Maybe a little grounds. Taste is just as much coffee as the aroma. A light coffee bitterness. Balanced by a sweet malt backbone that almost seems to have a bit of lactose in it. Overall pretty damn good. May have to drink the whole can","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
1330,"2015-12-21",3.5,"2oz taster on tap at HopCat in Indianapolis. Clear amber orange color. Thin off-white head. Leaves good thicker lace. Awesome bigger java character to this. Some caramel, mild toastiness. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Mild slick texture. Moderate sweet, light bitter taste. Nice long coffee aftertaste. Tasty stuff, pretty much exclusively for the coffee, as far as I can tell. Its satisfyingly prominent. There is just a bit of green pepper towards the end, though.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1330,"2015-07-30",2.6,"Bell pepper all over. Dark color tan head. The flavor had green grass and roasted peppers. May be more pare intend as a spice and herbal brew.","St george, Utah, USA","Prolitariat777"
1330,"2015-04-26",2.0,"473ml can. Murky brown pour. This one has a huge amount of green pepper note, oxidized stale coffee i suspect.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1330,"2015-04-09",3.9,"Can. Pours clear amber brown with off white head. Nose is cold press coffee. Taste is pepper skin and coffee and then malt sweetness. Thin mouth feel. Refreshing.","Iowa, USA","arnold931"
1330,"2015-03-02",3.4,"Clear, dark brown with a small, off-white head.
Coffee, caramel aroma.
Taste is sweet, mild coffee.
Brown ale-like.....nice flavour but a bit watery.
Very mild.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
1330,"2015-02-27",3.6,"Bottle. Strong coffee and caramel malt aroma. Medium brown with moderate head. Black coffee, light caramel malt and hay flavor. Decent body. Nice coffee flavor but not a great deal else.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
1330,"2015-01-22",3.7,"16oz can shared. Poured a medium copper to brown color completely clear, with off white head that doesnt linger. Nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is coffee, medium malt and a certain nuttiness. The flavor is a very nice blend of coffee and Scottish style ale with that nuttiness in the middle. Very tasty and very well balanced.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
1330,"2014-12-13",3.5,"Pour on tap at the brewery, hazy dark orange pour with thin white head, aroma has notes of bitter coffee, earth, coffee grounds, slight roast into a bit of caramel. Taste is a mix of big coffee, vanilla, nice green coffee into some slight cocoa, touch of caramel, finishing sweet. Nice.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1330,"2014-11-30",3.8,"Pours a light thin brown with 3 fingers of head. Nose is all coffee, taste is wee coffee up front wee Mac on the end. Seemed a little thin to support the coffee. That said its in the league of Bender and quite quaffable.","Long Lake, Illinois, USA","JoePeesie"

This meeting of Hawaiian and Indianapolis tastes sounded much better on paper. It is drinkable though if you have the option of going with Sun Kings more hoppier alternatives Id pick those instead. Four ounces was enough to convince me that this needs some improvement.

Aroma / Appearance - The reddish brown color of the body is the color of freshly brewed iced tea. Wisps of ivory head curl around the glass. Straight black coffee, burnt malts, and a strong profile for the ABV almost pull off a positive experience.

Flavor / Palate - Black coffee is accented by a slightly hoppy kick. Gas station grade coffee feels weak and a little watered down. Tasting a bit like a heavily malted brown ale this was an interesting experiment that just doesnt work. Scroll past unless you have to tick every single draft.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1330,"2013-10-22",3.5,"Draft to taster. Looks good for the style; a transparent orangish brown with thin off-white lacing. Smells of bitter coffee. Tastes like it smells, but more balanced. The toffee comes through a bit too. Good on the palate. Finishes better than it starts.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1330,"2011-09-05",3.7,"growler by way of stfun 1/16/11.
clear auburn color with an almond paste tinted head.
it smells like day old coffee, whole beans, cocoa butter, vanilla, sweet grain and caramel.
the flavor is full of buttery caramel coffee... much like a cold brew (w/o the bitterness). 
it is medium bodied and oily but prickly carb helps out. neat. 8/3/7/3/15+","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"
1330,"2010-04-28",3.8,"Served from the growler shared by awiseman01 at DLD 10. The appearance is medium brown. Lots of medium roast coffee, hazelnut, caramelized sugars. I really dig the coffee infused medium bodied beers that have been popping up. A lot lighter then the coffee irs but with plenty to offer in flavors. Thanks Andy!","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
1330,"2010-01-23",3.6,"Draft sample at Sun King. Poured a clear brown color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate toasted malt and coffee aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium toasted sweet and coffee flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Smooth and drinkable beer that is coffee brown ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1330,"2010-01-10",4.2,"Maybe my favorite of the Sun King beers. Pours a deep, dark brown, with a thin head that gives way to minimal lacing. Aroma is awesome; lots and lots of dry roasted coffee, slightly bitter. Flavor is tart and dry, with the coffee taking center stage, backed up by biscuits, toffee, and a hint of caramel. This beer is outstanding.","Indiana, USA","StFun"
1330,"2010-01-09",3.3,"tap at the brewery - Pours a medium brown color with an off-white head.  The aroma is dominated by the coffee.  The coffee goes fairly well with the flavor.  Its not a real strong coffee flavor but its still pretty dominate because the caramel malt profile is mild.  Its light to medium bodied with some mild hops and a finish that leaves lingering coffee flavors.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
1330,"2009-12-21",2.8,"Growler from the brewery. Poured a clear amber brown with a small brown head. Aroma had a nice acidic note from the coffee. Flavor was coffee through out without much else.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1330,"2009-12-19",3.9,"Picked up a growler of this downtown on their awesome $5 growler fill nights.  Poured with a head that left me immediately.  Great coffee flavour in the nose.  Strong too.  The taste isnt what I expected.  Very balanced leaving the beer to do its work with some undertones of coffee and not overpowering at like some other coffee beers. If the look of this beer wasnt what it is theyd have a higher rating.  Overall though its a very good brew.",", Indiana, USA","pinion"
1330,"2009-11-24",3.4,"From a Growler. A very drinkable dark amber/brown ale with light coffee aroma. Taste was surprisingly smooth given the coffee/mocha undertones. Taste was a nice blend of roasted malt, coffee and lightly hopped. If you are not a coffee person, dont let the name scare you from sampling this quite drinkable brew.","Indiana, USA","ESBob"
1330,"2009-11-22",3.8,"Growler, pours clear golden brown with off white bubbly head. Nose is dominated with inviting coffee over the top of caramel malt. Flavor is smooth and sweet, caramel is evident with a wonderful coffee bean component. One of their better current offerings. I like it.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","awiseman01"
1330,"2009-11-22",3.6,"Growler.  Pours dark amber with brown highlights.  A thin white head lightly laces the glass.  The aroma consists of coffee, mocha, and a hint of hops.  Coffee and chocolate flavors dominate.  Finishes with a sweet caramel aftertaste.   I expected a fuller body, but this beer has a light watery body with mild carbonation.  However, this is still a solid quality brew with a wonderful coffee aroma and flavor.","Indiana, USA","Jethro6191"
1330,"2009-10-18",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2009 Picked up a growler in the tap room.  Pours a roasted nut brown with some nice lasting dirty white head.  Lots of depth in the nose.  I get a soft blend of medium roast coffee along with plenty of toffee richness.   The flavor has some pleasant coffee character and it adds a bit of bitterness to be beer as well.  Still quite malty like Wee Mac with a very dry finish.  Easily one of my favorite Sun King brews so far.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
