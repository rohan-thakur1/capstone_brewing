2509,"2017-06-15",3.3,"Kolor bladozłoty, niezbyt mętny. Dosć sztywna piana na początku, szybko opada i pozostawia okrąg na szkle. W zapachu głównie słody, cytrusy, marakuja gdzieś w tle. W smaku marakuja, delikatna chmielowa goryczka, owocowa kwaskowość. Mogłoby być nieco mniej wysycone, dość mało ciała. Mimo wszystko pije się baaardzo dobrze","Gdańsk, POLAND","jnitka"
2509,"2017-06-11",3.4,"Clear, light gold pour with a decent white head. Orange, passionfruit and light malt aromas. Taste is dry, slightly sour, fruity, low bitterness. For low ABV its fantastic, as a regular beer it punches way above its weight.","AUSTRALIA","varanid99"
2509,"2017-06-11",3.1,"Can, 2.2%. Clear golden with tiny white head. Aroma is malt, fruit and a little passion fruit. Flaovur is malt, fruit, little passion fruit, little sour sourness, medium sweet, little thin, little over carbonated and a little dry.","DENMARK","chrisv10"
2509,"2017-06-09",3.4,"090617. Can from Greenslopes Cellars. So little alcohol but so much flavour. While this beer may look a bit on the pale side it more than makes up for it in flavour. It was not as tart and sour as I was thinking it was going to be and there was a distinct passion fruit sweetness coming through.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
2509,"2017-06-05",2.8,"Straw coloured. Solid aroma with citrusy hops and notes of fruit. Dry and tart taste, followed by light flavours of hops and fruit. Finishes lightly bitter. Light body. Overall, a rather average pale ale. The aroma is good, but I do not appreciate hops in dry beers. The passion fruit is also very discrete.","Århus, DENMARK","Echon"

2509,"2017-06-02",2.9,"BB 21/11/17. Poured a hazy orangey-amber with a one-finger off-white frothy head that diminished quickly to a blotchy cap that laced very poorly. Carbonation low, average and coarse. Aroma subtly of sweet citrus with very low sourness; no real hops presence. Taste of lemony sourness with hints of sweet passionfruit; very low bitterness. Light body. Smooth with a thin mouthfeel and a moderately long finish that has both sweet fruitiness and hints of sourness. A better tasting low alcohol gluten-free beer.","Tarragindi, AUSTRALIA","KeefOz"

2509,"2017-03-25",3.8,"330 ml. bottle. BBF 21/11/18. Bright near clear golden, brief white head. Nose is lightly metallic, mineral, touch stale with lemon juice low To Øl lemon sour profile. Nose is bit stale, mineral, taste is definitely better. Taste is basic lemon sour, refreshing, faintly mineral, low fluffy stale cornbread malts, basic lemon juice, idea of metallic. Soft carbonation, vaguely metallic lemon juice body. Pretty simple & refreshing. For a low ABV gluten free fruit beer, this is stupidly good. More lemon juice than passion fruit for me.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
