4013,"2016-07-30",4.0,"Reviewed from notes.
On tap at the Blackback, Waterbury, VT.
They poured this into a tulip.
The appearance was a glossy/hazy burnt dark orange color. Thin white head. Sly amount of lacing.
The smell started off with thick juicy to bitter orange juice to pulp. Sweetly dosed with some grapefruit pulp and rind.
The flavor brings it all together for a spectacular bittersweet balance. Gentle juicy to the touch in the aftertaste. Slick sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation seems to feel good, fairly low. Smooth coat of juice slides across my tongue. Some bitterness.
Overall, damn nice APA that I would love to have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

4013,"2016-01-08",3.6,"Sample at the brewery. Restraint in a glass. Despite brewing with a pretty pungent hop that Ive seen a lot of brewers use to make a hop bomb, Hill Farmstead have gone the opposite way with this one and made a very dry, balanced pale ale. Strong and pleasant aroma, but I found the actual taste to be a bit one-dimensional and fleeting. Somewhat boring compared to everything else on tap.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

 Oh my. Citrus hop all the way. Smells like a really well hopped IPA. Tropical fruits and citrus. Just a hint of grainy malt shines through.
Taste is more focused on orange citrus, but still retains some tropical fruit flavors. No sweetness, grainy malts give the only bit of backbone it has. Almost no bitterness.
 Medium carbonation, maybe a little low from the growler. Light body. Drinkable as hell.

4013,"2014-10-22",4.3,"This growler is a few days past ""expiration"" due to a shipping issue, but feels to be in fine shape; thank you Andrew. Typically perfect HF pour; juicy, clouded tangerine orange topped with fluffy, fine-bubbled white. Guava and pineapple in the initial tropical wave; seared citrus rinds and sunflower seeds fill in the cracks as the initially stunning sunshine grays a little. Salty baguette malt and ample mineral character suggest the high quality of this independent of the hop layering.

Flavor bursts with fresh clementine, lime zest, Meyer lemon and guava, while a delicate grassy sweetness softens those bright colors. Salty, earthy lemon pepper and a mild zucchini like pungency may suggest the beginning of the decline; Shauns pale ales are generally near perfection, but even a few extra days seems to upset the tightrope-like balance somewhat.

The palate is still gorgeous and not improvable. Pillowy and full, cottony, with amply crisp carbonation; finish flashes juiciness and then succinctly vanishes. The high fruity acids are still vibrant, and while vegetal leafiness and seedy bitterness are distantly present, this is polished and on the mark, as always. 

If Shaun used this template for a noble hopped pale ale it would surely be close to a perfect beer for me.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

-The finish is resinous and moderately bitter.

Pours a murky golden orange color with a bubbly off white head and average streaks of lacing. Aroma is powerfully dank and resiny, overwhelmed by the citra hops and unsurprisingly not much else.

4013,"2012-09-20",4.3,"In short: A cushiony and highly aromatic blonde IPA bursting with refreshing tropical and exotic fruits.  Great beer
How: Tap, fresh directly at the brewery
The look: Cloudy murky blonde body topped by a small white head leaving lots of lacings on the glass
In long: The highly aromatic nose has some of the typical (to me) cat urine smell that characterises most Citra IPA, but there is also quite a lot of tropical fruits.  Body has a very similar (if not identical) malt backbone to most Hill Farmstead Pale Ale, .this mean a nice bready (baguette) and crackery malt bill with a cushiony mouthfeel and a low sweetness sensation.  The hops bombards the palate with refreshing fruity flavors and aromas but the bitterness remains smooth and round and of medium intensity.  This is truly a wonderful session IPA, never aggressigopve, full of flavors but never too intense.  I actually preferred it over its bigger sister HF Double Citra.  Can a man have a G-Spot?  Because I think mine is at Hill Farmstead.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4013,"2012-08-21",4.1,"pour is hazy dark orange with light sediment floating around and a white head with some loose bubbles on top. The hops are quite strong, it gives it a tropical fruit aroma with grapefruit and pineapple notes. There is an accompanying dough malt playing around underneath but subtle.  The flavor is more balanced, the Malta are grainy with a light doughiness. The hops are assertively tropical, grapefruit and pineapple, with an assertive bitterness, dry finish, and clean light to medium body. Overall, another good beer from hill farmstead. Good balance, different malt components, interesting focus on the citra hop, extremely bright for a lower abv beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

A: Hazy and orange, with about an inch of white head that leaves some good lacing on the pint glass.

S: Nice bouquet of citrus and hops.

T: Delicious. Not quite as hop forward as the Cenotaph, but perhaps smoother and easier drinking. Wonderful aroma and flavor coming from the Citra hops.

T - Lots of strong grapefruit, from the hops, up front giving way quickly to a mix of sweet caramel malt and strong citric hops. Finish is caramel sweet with some lingering bitterness from the hops and dryness from the yeast. There is no doubt in my mind that I am a sucker for citra hops.

Sweet citrus hop aroma with lots of citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hints of pineapple, lemon peel and grapefruit are accompanied by some dank earthy pine needle notes. Caramel malt presence in the nose as well with hints of biscuit and graham cracker. The hops smell uber fresh but the malt presence cuts this down a bit. It kind of smells like a tamer cousin of a WCIPA.

Chewy full body for the style with lots of dank, fresh hop bitterness up front that lingers throughout over the sweet citrus/tropical fruit notes and malt backbone into a crisp, dry finish. Although the flavor is dominated by hops, the hop flavors are very well balanced. The palate starts off with very dry earthy piny bitterness which is quickly countered by an excellent sweet citrus flavor. Hints of mango and pineapple as well as some grapefruit and citrus peel. All of this is also nicely balanced by the caramel/graham cracker/biscuit malt backbone.
