1717,"2017-03-12",3.6,"16 oz. Can from Brewers Haven. Pours out a cloudy yellow/gold, with thick rocky head. Mildly fruity aroma, snow white bread too. Taste also leans on the fruity notes, but more lemon than banana. Body is also a shade thin, but still a pretty good representation of the style.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"

1717,"2015-07-12",3.4,"Plein de clou de girofle dans larôme avec un peu de banane. En bouche il y a du blé, clous de girofle, et cest aussi très peu fruité.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","vadie"

$10 a growler.
Pours a hazy ,bright yellow with a nice sized thick creamy white head.
Nice fresh banana,spice and bread aromas.
Taste similar to aroma with a bit of summer fruit thrown in.
Kinda comes up short in the palate..starts of fine but gets a wee bit watery by the end.
But overall for a 80-90 degree day its fine stuff.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

1717,"2013-03-03",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 16, 2013 On draught at Beer 3/3/13 and then at Occidental.  A full-bodied hefeweizen.  Cloudy, bubbly golden color. Aroma of what and clove. Taste of banana bread and cloves.  Finishes very smooth; no need for a lemon. One of my favorite hefeweizens.","Oregon, USA","pdx77"
1717,"2012-08-24",3.3,"Poured a cloudy gold with a small lasting ivory head. Aromas of wheat, yeast, banana and light clove. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of wheat, yeast, light banana and light citrus with a crisp wheat finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
1717,"2012-08-12",3.6,"On tap at Podnahs Pit BBQ - Pours hazy golden with a big fluffy white head. Nose is lots of sweet wheat, a little banana, and subtle spicing. Melon, tropical fruit, and a good deal of bready yeast. Not like most of the hefes Ive had--more full and less sweet. Same taste, real fruit- and wheat-forward, with a mineral finish. Thick and slick body. I liked it, but a more mineral, more banana-ey hefe is my thing.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1717,"2012-05-16",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 5, 2012 Completely opaque apricot yellow. Head is creamy, white, and tight-bead. Tell-tale hefe, all the way; with an amazingly fresh and wonderfully wholesome yeast character. Medium bodied, full mouthfeel, great carb, and a mellow finish that has just a hint of tartness to balance out all that yeasty wheat-malt goodness. Supremely full-flavored, hearty without being heavy, quenching without being thin. Fresh-baked honey-biscuit with banana/pear preserves and spices. Maybe I was just pleasantly surprised by this, but it really hit the spot for me.  Beats New Glarus, tops Heater Allen, and more than holds up to classic old-school examples.  Perhaps this was just an amazing batch or something because Ive had other trusted palates tell me they were not quite so enamored with it.  Looking forward to trying it again, comparing it side-by-side with some of the others I typically enjoy, and seeing if this score holds up for me.  Currently my favorite wheat-treat.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
1717,"2012-03-31",3.3,"On tap at Ventis South. Heavy banana and clove aroma. Banana and some tart citrus flavors. Dry finish that seems a bit over carbonated. Overall a pretty good Hefeweizen.","Turner, Oregon, USA","BK7"
