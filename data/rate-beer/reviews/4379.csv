4379,"2012-11-10",3.0,"Not to shabby. I would say this is fairly good introductory dark beer for anyone interested in getting into darker beers. Love the subtle hints of jack daniels. Though I would say, and it might be that I had this beer at noon, the beer had a tad flat taste to it, though still has some flavor. Though not much color just looking at it, has a lovely brown, orange red coloring in the light. Overall pretty good.","Austin, Alabama, USA","Chrisundrum"
4379,"2012-11-03",3.6,"Black with a light tan head. Aroma wasnt weird, but was unexpected for sure; mesquite wood smokiness with a firm whiskey undertone, and subtle toasty vanilla. Firm flavor of roasty dark maltiness with a caramel and chocolate sweetness, with a great accompanying presence of light oaked whiskey and with a finish of oaked caramel/chocolate/vanilla on a semi light body.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

Flavor has a malty profile of rich cocoa, with alot of oak and some sweet, warm tones of whiskey.  This brew picked up more oak and less bourbon / vanilla tones from the barrell than is usual for barrell aged beers, although it is still distinctly there.  My favorite from nxnw so far.","Denver, Colorado, USA","tennessejed420"

I had tried this before but never reviewed it. The beer pours a brown color with a tan head. The aroma is oak and bourbon, just what I look for in a bourbon-barrel aged beer.

4379,"2009-12-05",4.0,"Tasting at the brewpub.  The beer is made by aging the pubs ""Okanogan black ale"" in barrels formerly used to age Jack Daniels whiskey.  Maintains the toasted cereal flavor of the black ale with a hint of Jack on the finish.   The Jack plays really well with the beers flavors.  The more I sipped it, the more I liked it.  Unfortunately, they have not been able to ramp up production of this beer despite strong interest from their patronage.","","User69782"

Aromas of strong woody/oakiness, earthy, roasty, with light chocolate, and a trace of bourbon. The earthy/woodiness definitely dominates the aromas. Tastes of vanilla, whisky (more than the aromas), caramel, lighter roast, and vanilla. Body a bit on the thinner side.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
4379,"2009-03-30",3.7,"On tap. Had a dark, near-black color, though some burgundy shone through. Aroma was definitely woody with a hint of bourbon. Mellow bitterness combined with woodiness and a bit of alcohol to make a fairly well-balanced brew. Very smooth, with a tingly combination of the alcohol and carbonation.

Patchy thin head with a delicate thing ring lingering around the outside of the glass. Flavor: All whiskey upfront followed a strawberry/raspberry mix, some raosty-ness in the body with a smooth citrus finish. Wonderfully crafted beer.

Smell isnt overly strong but is quite inviting and nice.  Subtle deep roasty malt, & some bourbon as well.  Taste is incredibly smooth.   Rich licorice like roasty malt, and a nice hit of bourbon flavor without the boozy, hot feel.  Better than the Okanogan schwarzbier itself, and the Barrel aging adds some nice complementing character to this beer.
