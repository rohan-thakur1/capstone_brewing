Aroma of clove, banana, bubblegum and bread dough. Palate is light body with high carbonation. Flavour is banana-clove yeast character upfront, with bread dough in the middle and a clean finish with very light hop spice and bitterness running through.

2638,"2014-04-04",2.3,"A pure gold beer with a fine creamy head that dissipates quickly. Big yeasty cloves and a broad malt aroma. Some straw-like hops. Thin palate and overly carbonated (forced?). Ginger and watermelon in the mouth, with a touch of honey. The yeast is a constant through to the finish. Shows a bit more of the malt as it warms. Finishes with some sweat peach flavours. Much less impressive and enjoyable than their Amber Weiss - so a bit pointless in my mind. That said, its a well made pointless beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"
