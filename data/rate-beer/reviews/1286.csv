1286,"2014-06-03",3.5,"On tap @ McGivneys.
This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange to brown color with a good bar pour that didnt yield any head, however, there was a decent amount of light clingy lacing sliding into the body.
The aroma smelled like any other typical ESB (British malt-like but not soapy).
The taste was malty with a little bit of light apples here and there. There was a nice light malty aftertaste that ended up leading towards a malty dry like finish.
On the palate, it sat about a light to medium and showed a decent sessionable quality running over my mouth and tongue.

Pours a nice amber ale with some surface foam and a spotty lace. Smells of amber malts, some metal, some herbal hops, some hints of herbs. Really, overall nose is inoffensive and approachable with a hint of sweetness - as I believe an ESB should be, fine work Dick. Flavor hits with well steeped black tea, some sweet and English malts and a bit of herbal hops sans bitterness. Nice ESB flavor. Medium bodied with reserved carb and a semi wet finish. Nice beer. ESBs are one to feel good drinking and drinking and drinking...This has that. Unobtrusive and approachable - not the most unique, but thats what makes it good!

This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, deep copper color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic with very fragrant aromas of piney/grassy/citrus hop aroma, paired with estery aroma of fruit, and nutty/toffee aroma. The palate is firm, with excellent pale, and sweet toffee malt flavor, with good fruity estery flavors of plum and apple. This beer finishes with more excellent malty and fruity flavors, then ends with a big smack of piney hop bitterness that lingers. I was really impressed with the tremendous character of this beer.

Good hop balance, mostly with bitterness. Finish gives a clean bitter taste, subtlety of pepper on the far far end. Body is soft and forgiving, minimal carbonation as if trying to impersonate the cask. If I understand this style correctly, this is a supurb beer. Approachable and sessionable.

Pours a very clear reddish brown with a dense two finger head, that settles slowly to a thick cap, leaving behind a solid sheeting of lace. On the second pour the beer was very cloudy.

Smell; very pleasant earthy and slightly spicy hops stand out at first. Smells pretty much how I would expect an ESB to be. Theres also some nice caramel malts.

Taste; the hops arent quite as strong as I was expecting based on the aroma, but theyre nicely there. In the beginning this is a bit earthy, with a good caramel malt backbone, and then finishes a little on the spicy side. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice smooth carbonation, and a very good drinkability.

1286,"2006-01-11",4.1,"Deeply broad and beautiful orangey color with a medium/full stack of egg shell hued soft, creamy foam. Keeps a great cap of about a 1/4 inch for the entire duration of the session. Patchy and broken sheets of lacing coat the glass well. An excellent looking glass to drool over.

Wiff time...Aroma is quite grassy and feathered in herbalness with a slight toasted malt wiggle underneath. Perhaps a little light at first but somehow gains more waft as it sits.

Taste is pretty solid here for an ESB. Subtle layers of toasted malts and grains & grassy, herbal, leafy, hops, create a nice balance and texture for a delicate ride of ESB styled fun. Starts fine and smoothly textured with a bit of sweet bready grainyness mixing quite well with a broad grassy hop tone. Toastyness ensues towards the midranges as a woody hop adds some cardboard pulp and leafyness. It rounds off with a floating finish of frothy textured toasted grainy, grassy bitterness and wood pine. Kinda ends a bit too soon, but fits the style. It does however have a very light kickback of flavors very late after it grows on ya.

Feel is quite nice with a standard medium, smooth body; no real rough areas other than a tad of scarring on the palate from its toasted grainyness and fluffyish texture of hoppy leafyness. After determining most of its character from sip after sip, there seems to be just a bit more subtlety adding to it. A very light citric lemon/orange peel spritz does sqeeze into some of the hoppy return late into its kickbacked finish.

For an ESB this was one hell of a very well crafted beer in my book. The subltety took its toll on me along with its very nice body and drinkability. Overall, a strikingly fine beer.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

On the border between transparent and transluscent, this amber to cherry-red and beige colored beer invites a beige colored head to dinner and the two chat in to the evening (alternatively, the head is well-retained).  Spotty lacing evident on the glass.  Very respectable appearance for a pressurized, low gravity draught.  Aroma has a touch of earth to it, lightly musty notes arise as well, and then a hint of cherries, dry peaches and finally soft caramel.  Only a smattering of orange-peel-like citrus notes are apparent at first, but after warming, evolve to a more broad orange and light grapefruit variety.  Flavor combines medium-dry caramel with light oranges and a touch of minimally sour, munich-like grains.  Supportive malting mixed with low carbonation produces a lightly creamy texture.  Strong dryness on the finish suggestive of dusty yeast, dry grains and light hop bitterness.  Fresh, and with more yeast character than your average American ESB.

Boy, this is some flavorful stuff, nothing shy here.  Very malty and earthy, with a moderately roasty flavor and a solid, grapefruity hoppiness in the finish.  The roasty, earthy malts are actually too strong here for the style, but its tasty nonetheless.  But the aroma, wow, talk about a strong, earthy maltiness.  Not really getting much else in the nose.  Medium body is fine for the style, but seems thin compared to the amount of flavor.  Head retention is solid, slowly receding to and maintaining a thin but full layer.  Cheesecloth lacing covers much of the glass.

The aroma is a mix of sweet malt, herbal hops, and fruity notes of cherry currants and raisins.  The taste is sweet up front, but quickly moves to a sharp biting hop note.  The finish has a solid bitterness to it that comes to dominate the beer.  I was really quite surprised by the bitterness found in this beer, it is actually quite nice, I just had to readjust from my initial expectations.  There is a definite red currant note here, that seems to be hop derived, as well as notes of pine, light citrus notes of grapefruit.  The sharp hoppy bitterness of this beer really dries out the finish and makes you want to take another draught.  As the beer warms up it begins to pick up some sweetness in the finish that is a mix of fruity and caramel/toffee notes.

1286,"2005-08-04",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2006 Original rating (one of my first) 8/4/05: From the bottle. Pours a clear copper with a small head. The nose offers orange peel, hops, and a hint of yeast. The flavor is mellow and refreshing, though not the least sweet - the caramel roasted malts quickly yield in fine balance to a well-poised hop bitter. The mouthfeel is soft, almost a bit watery, but not unpleasant in any way.

This is a fine beer that goes down easy with a lovely, though in no way brash, hop bitterness --- a great session ale for those who love hops. Well worth visiting and revisiting. 8/4/8/3/17 = 4.0
Re-rating 6/4/06: This is a seriously c-hopped interpretation of an ESB, so much so that ventures well into IPA territory by British standards if not by West Coast standards. Plenty of rich malt, quite buttery, standard c-hop profile, nice bitter finish, not much sweetness. Well done, and a pleasure to drink, but not quite the 4.0 that I gave it the first time around.

Sweet malted caramel aroma with a forceful pinesap air, but just enough to balance the malt and bring out the underlying floral and grass notes.  The head remains on top, but becomes disparate and patchy.  Smooth palate, with just a hint of grit: caramelized brown sugar.  Creamy nuts, and a light fruitiness match the strong pine-hop (and grapefruit) bitterness with ease and allow this beer to walk the fine line of balance.  As I can only judge by my bottle, this beer is grossly underratedand I cant image how wonderful it would be on caskah, what a nice thought.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"

Dry pine needle, pile of leaves hoppiness with underlying Snicker bar nose. Surprisingly light body, but very fluffy mouthfeel immediately. Tarry pine at first swallow, strong leaf and some biscuit as well.  After it warms, more malty features present themselves. Nougat, caramel and hazlenuts.  Piney, bitter hops last through the whole taste, and last long after swallow.  Some saltiness and more nutt flavors as it warms up even more.

1286,"2004-11-09",4.2,"Shimmering copper. Swirled mixture of creamy foam and medium sized bubbles slowly forms chalky rocks. Peppy, slightly airy nose of fresh bushy hops, perfume, glazed pine, and roasted nuts beneath a buttery caramel drizzle. Fluffy, fairly loose bubbles. Elegant showcase of soothing, palate-coating caramel and nut notes. Background of subtle cinnamon esters with a rounded tropical fruitiness that energizes the rich pine. Fabulous house character. Phenomenal balance, yet sneakily hoppy and bitter, throughout. Tight bitterness of pine needles buttresses the endless malt lushness. Perfect level of airiness briefly counteracts the hops and makes way for a richly malty engulfment nuanced with orange rind and flowery hops. Piney bitterness and minty hop flavors persist into the finish amid a chewy, continual thrust of caramel and assorted nuts. This pushes the envelope as far as it can go, ESB-wise, and does it all without jeopardizing its to style nature. Off the cask, this would be heavenly, and dare I say, even more magical.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
