560,"2017-05-30",3.8,"On tap @ Barleycorn. This is a deeper dark brown looking one, almost deep copper and quite cloudy in the glass. A huge almost creamy khaki head leaving nice lacings and dots down the glass. The nose has tones of sweet dark candied sugar, earthy fruit. I get a little bit of alcohol, warming, pleasant. Tastes quite good this. It has a good almost acidic sweetness. Lots of dark candied sugar heres. Its really smooth and creamy in the mouth and therefor somewhat soft on the carbonation. Traces of both cold coffee and chocolate wrapper. In the end it turns more nutty in a way with a taste of burnt raisins.

560,"2016-11-30",3.7,"October 12th, 2014 - Valor Moghulis! And yes, this was had during a new episode of HBOs Game of Thrones, though I dont think any of the characters actually used this iconic phrase in the episode. Dark and shadowy, its link to the organization and its surreptitious susurrations around the main characters is made clear. The aroma is tangy, with the sweet side of red bordeaux grapes, and a slight umami note to give the grape some savory depth. Additional sips reveal additional flavors, like a touch of leather uncoiling as the beer warms, or beef jerky and its attending spices. Blueberries and blackberries appear on the back end, as if caught while trying to slip away, arrested in panic and with just a low touch of sweetness. The flavor strongly resembles a dubbel, with wood and cheese and lots of umami to pass around. The berries make a return along with apple juice and cherry juice to top off the flavors. Listing all these tastes make it sound sweet, and it might be closer to a dessert than an appetizer, but the rungs of umami layers provide the balance and support on which to hang some sugary sweet touches without making this cloying. How delightfully piercing.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

560,"2016-11-13",3.5,"Bottle (BB July 2018).

Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy dark amber to medium brown.

Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, roasted nuts, toasted grain), lightly to moderately yeasty (basement), with notes of clove, licorice, brown sugar, orange peel.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter, spicy.

Medium to full body, watery/velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. 

Quite clovey-spicy (almost as if spices were added, as they do with their year-round dubbel) and fairly acidic as well, two things that make it hard to get really enthusiastic about this one. The aftertaste similarly seems spiced, and it becomes fatiguing fairly quickly from that despite being well-balanced for the most part. Its clean, solid, and nicely made, it just doesnt excite me.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
560,"2016-10-27",4.2,"Bottled 7/18/16 Deep crimson. Off-beige foam exhibits near 5-star retention. Maltcenrtic nose of black plum, tobacco, vanilla, hazelnut, raisin, and suggestive melanoidins. Hints of aniseed (Spalt?) and dried leather. Fluffy and expansive carbonation. Elegant and deceptively weightless maltiness delivers a mouthwatering smattering of springy tobacco and cookie notes on initial taste. A tinge of vanilla further softens the languidly evolving maltiness, enriching the squeaky clean fermentation with extraordinary textural richness including silky melanoidins. Nutty and claylike yeast imparts Abbeylike character without affecting the sparkling attenuation. Distant German-hop-derived candied fennel suggestions are seamlessly integrated within the malt-dense core. An ""airy"" and peppery dimension keeps the sugars in check, unveiling a blindingly bright assortment of zingy rock candy and perfectly ripe plums as it gracefully sweeps the palate. Suggestive creamed java attests to the skillful malt extraction, as a buried snap of candied pecans and breadcrust bring additional contrast to the richer elements. Masterfully balanced finish is semi-dry and gently coarse in its pepperiness, with a sweet tobacco and dusty yeast punctuation. As with the tripel in this series, this is absolutely bang-on to style, and simply top-notch nectar. ""Purity"" is the descriptor that repeatedly comes to mind when describing the malt character in this, and the level of sophistication found here is not to be overstated. It has all the complexity I look for in the style, yet never feels overcrowded, and the high degree of attenuation, coupled with the exquisite balance, is a divine match and just makes this effortless to throw back. Obviously German noble hops, to boot. Im so heartened that Ommegang has been elevating their game these past few years and still occasionally churns out some unapologetically traditional styles like this one, sans the bells and whistles.

Probably the best of the GoT branded beers so far - probably because an abbey dubbel is more in keeping with Ommegangs normal fare than some of the other ones have been. Full flavour supported by a full body and a decently weighty ABV that doesnt intrude, but warms while providing the appropriate gravitas. There was a very faint metallic tang at the outset, but that seems to have disappeared as the beer warmed up from its initial cellar temperature of about 5-6ºC (40ºF) to a more appropriate serving temperature of above 10ºC (50ºF).

560,"2015-01-10",3.8,"750 ml bottle from the LCBO. 
Appearance: Pours a murky chestnut brown with lots of sediment right off the bat. Very nice. A dense tan head about one finger thick builds with petty good retention. Lacing is sparse but dense where it forms. 
Aromas: Belgian yeast, dates and other dark fruits, caramel-toffee, molasses. 
Flavours: Dates, prunes, Belgian yeast, molasses, salt-toffee, hints of caramel. 
Mouthfeel: Moderate viscosity with heavy carbonation. 
Overall: Im not usually a huge fan of Belgian style beers but this dubbel was quite nice. Lots of complex aromas and flavours. The dark fruit component was particularly noticeable in both the aroma and flavour.","Ontario, CANADA","HopsandBolts"
560,"2015-01-10",3.8,"1/10/15. A beautiful amber vessel found upon a high shelf situated very curiously amongst others not near its beauty. I, a mere mortal, traveled far and wide across valleys, fields, and mountains just to find this vessel, this vessel of glass blown by glass blowers bred deep in the Fargarts Caves of Budor, bred specifically with lungs of dragon, both in size and heat, for obvious reasons. A cork graces the top... a cork from the finest cork trees in the forbidden dark forests of Cucambia. No doubt many perished in the harvesting of this rare jewel. Finally, the cork is removed, a fine ale vessel nearby, along with the beautiful Mrs. Owl of Milan. For what is to share such a beautiful ale but with a beautiful companion? The heart, it grows with fine company, fine ales, and romance... The look of this ale strikes the eye like the blood of a dwarf slain heftily by sword of Kings! Not red, but dirty brown like the dirt those filthy beings come forth from, for shame! A billowy head sits atop like a tan fluffy cloud, the filthy, dirt stained clouds that hover above dirty, spell ridden evils. The aroma wafts up nicely... about like the faint, sweet aroma of a forbidden fruit, and I dont mean food... but one must not go on about that here... The aroma and flavor are abound with the finest toffees, figs, and caramels of Tiyr, breads of Riiut, and the fruits of Vnoor. The palate sits thick but lively, like a pool of fat Orcs dancing in subdued glee after a successful hunt of mortals... mortals like I... who leave this message from the clouded and blurry afterlife, sipping ales, chasing tails. To you all I say... VLAGOR UNS YBUNTINOS!!!!","Georgia, USA","drowland"

Medium body, creamy entry, creamy, but thinning, yet chewier middle, a light, very blanketing carbonation with medium sharpness comes in along side a pleasant alcohol warmth that lasts a bit beyond the surprisingly dry, somewhat slick finish.

560,"2014-11-28",1.1,"Well to start, this beer sucks. It really sucks. Its also the second time Ive bought a big bottle from Ommegang to have with a holiday meal and been utterly disappointed in the result. I had hoped a nice dubbel would be a good partner to turkey. Im still waiting to find out, because this wasnt anything close to a nice dubbel. It looked right, a reddish color, light beige head. The aroma though, was clean, hinted at caramel and even a little grassy hop (really?). The flavor was the real tragedy though. Dry, fizzy, carbonic bite, somewhat acrid with a hint of caramel and phenol spice, and then an empty thin finish with a big wallop of bittering hops. The flavor just ended up completely dominated with bitter hops. What the hell Ommegang? A dubbel should not be this hoppy. The lack of malt backbone and dry fizzy bitterness made this an absolute disaster both as a standalone drink and especially as a partner to food. I managed to finish my initial 6-8 oz pour. No one else could stomach it so the rest of the big bottle was a drainpour. Implied not nice things said to the brewery here.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
560,"2014-11-28",3.5,"Stamped on the neck : packaging date of 09/04/14, best by 09/2017.
This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a nice looking dark brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that took a super long time before it dissipated to a concave clingy and somewhat foamy lacing. 
The smell had a sweet sticky cherry to light chocolate. Belgian sugars dance underneath a sweet sticky caramel and a light spice (I cant exactly tell what spice it is).
The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and combined to a sweet flavoring. Theres a sweet sticky caramel to cherry aftertaste along with a sweet and dry finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but not overbearing. Sticky caramel coated my tongue nicely. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good dubbel I could bang again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Medium malty sweetness with a taste of dried cherries. The beer has an acidic bite. Mouthfeel is medium full with a high level of carbonation. Overall, it's a good beer, but the super high carbonation level leaves an unpleasant acidic bite.

Aftertaste shows a good rich malt characteristic with some perceived alcohol notes, a bit of metal and slightly offensive notes and a deep earthiness from the malt and sugars.

560,"2014-10-14",3.9,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a dark brownish mahogany color with a one finger of tan colored head. The head fades rather rapidly at first and then leaves a bit of persistent foam, which slowly fades to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma is big of a dark fruit smell with tons of cherry, raisin and fig. Along with these smells comes some other fruity aromas of a light fruit nature with some apricot and pineapple both being there. There is some yeasty aromas as well as a little bit of a more banana and wheaty smell. With just a hint of booze hitting the nose as well, one is left with a rather fruity sweet, but very pleasurable aroma overall.
 Taste  The taste begins a bit drier then would have been anticipated from the nose, but by no means dry overall. There is a good showing of dark fruit flavor of cherry and plum, complimented by some other fruits of apricot and peach as well as a little bit of a toasted bready taste. As the flavor advances the darker fruits gain just a little bit of strength, while the lighter fruits gain even more. While the darker fruits remain the dominate sweeter flavor, the light fruits, with some candied sugar flavors joining in later, do give it a run for its money in terms of dominate sweet flavor. A yeast cake taste really brings on its potency at the end of the taste and is joined by a little bit of a more rum like booze flavor. The mix of flavors that is left at the end, leaves a nice fruity and robust fruited dubbel flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side. For the fruit flavors the higher carbonation level does rather nicely creating a rather crisper more refreshing feel, but with that said, the average body does well for the lightly roasted, boozy and yeasty flavors for the brew accentuating them in light of the fruit. Overall, this was rather well done and made for a good sipping dubbel.
 Overall  A rather nice, slightly more fruity dubbel. Another good brew by Ommegang, and while no Abbey ale, it is quite fantastic and worth a try.","","Darkmagus82"

Aroma: It has a very sweet candy-like aroma with notes of apple, figs, and banana. There is only a slight hint of alcohol. It doesnt have a huge amount of Belgian yeast character on the nose, but just enough to make it identifiably Belgian and it is pleasant.

Taste: It is a very nice, clean, dubbel. There is a fig flavor, along with some brown sugar, some sweet alcohol flavor (not burning or overpowering), and a light woody character in the background. There is a light banana chip flavor in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is awesome. It is perfectly smooth, great carbonation, and it coats the mouth with flavor without being overly sweet or sticky. Its perfect.

Overall: This is a very good dubbel that stands well by itself, even without the book or television reference in the packaging. I strongly believe that anyone who appreciates Belgian style beers will enjoy this and I recommend giving it a shot. What I really like about this beer is that it is nice and mellow.
