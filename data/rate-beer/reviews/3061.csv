3061,"2016-02-27",3.9,"From notes. Enjoyed at the 3rd Annual Barleywine Tasting at Traviss house on February 20. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a dark garnet color with some light brown tinting. There is a thin light tan head and a little bit of lace as it disappears. The aroma is pretty interesting. There is a ton of hops on this right up front. Makes me think of BA Bigfoot for sure. There is a nice light caramel and toffee and a lot of oak char. There is a little vanilla on the back end, but the hops really take back over. The flavor is pretty boozy. There is a lot of alcohol and a soft caramel. The barrel carries a lot of influence, and its just kind of single dimensional. I wish it were a little better. The mouth feel is pretty good, but it is a little light. The carbonation is a little sharp, and the aftertaste is lingeringly hoppy and boozy. This is pretty interesting, but it does remind me heavily of BA Bigfoot, which definitely isnt one of my favorite barleywines.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3061,"2016-01-07",4.2,"(750ml 2015 bottle from Systembolaget web order) Pours a clear pale mahogany with red highlights and small, dense and lingering off-white head with lace. Aroma has a sweet toffee and vanilla fudge core, lots of barrel character with bourbon and vanilla, oak, ashy, maple-smoked bacon, dates, some vague sweet berry notes, a bit of bready character to the malt. Flavour holds less sweetness and vanilla than the nose, with a relatively dry character for a big barley wine. The malt core has bits of toffee and caramel along with some breadiness like sweet dessert buns, a good helping of fairly hot bourbon with less vanilla and more whiskey grain and wood notes. A bit of sweet dried pit fruit in the middle - some dates but also apricot and maybe prune. Lots more oak builds towards the finish, tobacco and leather along with toasted wood. Finish is bone dry with low alcohol heat, whiskey, wood, light toast and maybe a bit of bittering hop. Medium full slightly oily body with light-medium carb. Quite a nice barrel-aged barley wine, not cloying at all.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Pours hazy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, brown bread, toasted oak, light citrus/pine, floral, grass, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light citrus/piney hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, brown bread, toasted oak, light coconut, light citrus/pine, floral, grass, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate pine bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, date, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, brown sugar, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light citrus/piney hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish.  Some slight dryness from bitterness as well. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged American barleywine. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light citrus/piney hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV.

Pours a murky walnut color, head is a small 1/4 inch and creme colored. Lacing is above average and head retention is average.

Smell is of rich toffee and caramel candy. Next is roasted malt, charred oak and whiskey with a hint of vanilla. Hops arent present and alcohol is definitely there.

Taste is heavy on caramel, butterscotch, diacetyls, and charred oak. Some whiskey burn is also present on the back end. Weird vinegar/acidic finish

Mouthfeel is syrupy, not as viscous as maple syrup, more like cough syrup. Carbonation levels were par for style and age. Wish head was present to add some layers to beer.

Overall good beer but at 25 bucks a pop, not worth the price. There were some off flavors that detracted from the beer reaching elite status. Glad to have tried it and always intrigued to get my hands on anything Great Divide releases.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

Aroma of strong oak and malt sweetness, with notes of whiskey, toffee, cherry, vanilla, caramel, earthiness, dark bread, faint spices and peppery alcohol in the background, the oak really coming to the fore, though. Murky, deep reddish-brown in color with a very fine, uneven and lasting head, leaving some fairly spectacular lacing behind as well. Flavor profile shows a good amount of oak even after well over a year in the cellar, along with plenty of rich, dark, sugary malt sweetness, lightly tart cherry, touches of toasted coconut and vanilla, brown sugar, and surprisingly prominent spicy hop bitterness, some peppery alcohol, wood and tea-like herbal tinges making their presence felt here late as well.

3061,"2014-10-14",4.3,"""upon opening, I was still greeted with more hops than Id expect after a long barrel aging process. upon pouring, however, the hops are almost totally replaced in the aroma by woody vanilla, caramel, and toffee. very nice aroma. The look is fairly typical for a barleywine, which is nice, but not standout. smallish head. the flavor achieves a balance somehow between the sweet malt, whiskey, wood, vanilla, and hops...it manages to be strong in both sweet and hoppy without one being totally overpowering, although there is nothing delicate about this complex brew. In fact, our palates were so assaulted, this beer marked the start and finish of my tasting for the night. at 50+ degrees, the sweet and whiskey are a little more in the forefront, with the bittering and drying hops in the finish. As the beer gets closer to room temp, the hops take over a bit from the whiskey. A very nice beer for sure, and a rare treat, but for the price, the only way Id get this again is to do a vertical tasting of regular/oak/and barrel aged Old Ruffians. 7/12 - 2011 batch, still not as complex as the base, due to the whiskey being in the fore, but pretty damn good. up a tenth of a point.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

Pours nice dark amber with fleeting yellow foam. Nose is bourbon barrels, vitamins, burnt caramel. As it warms, its like cinnamon toast crunch - hella cool. Flavor is like a cinnamon bun - rich and sweet with caramel, dark malts and herbal/spice qualities. Really not doing justice with that sentence.

A: Pours a murky sienna color with a khaki head forming on the pour. It recedes to a thick ring that leaves some splotchy lace down the glass.

S: Whiskey barrel upfront with some caramel and dark fruits. Chocolate covered raisins with a sweet malt bill.

T: More dark fruits with a whiskey barrel sweetness. Oak barrel, brown sugar with a nice roasted malt backing. The whiskey comes back with a sharp zing on the finish, but theres enough sweetness to balance it out.

Despite 20 months in the whiskey barrels, the barrels never dominate the already complex base beer, but rather accentuate it, while the hops are no longer very noticeable.

Last of my 09 BA Great Divide beers


A-- Poured a dark, murky, orange brown color. Muddy would be the best way to describe this beer. One finger tan head that settled to a solid tan film through drinking. Good spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. 

S-- Barrel is noticeable in the nose. Oak, leather and whisky. Solid stuff. Underneath the barrel notes got stewed plumbs, some Graham Cracker and a solid hop presence still. ABV is well masked for a near 13% beer. 

T-- Was quite unhappy with the first half of my glass as it was quite thin and watery. Once it got air it picked up in a big way. Very earthy, grainy, Carmel strawberry jam and hearty bread. Just flashes of oak and touches of whisky to round out the jam notes. 

M-- Decent amount of tannins left on gums. Left them numb for a few minutes. Still has the ABV punch. Low carbonation and not all that heavy until the end. Slightly slick and oily due to the hops. 

O-- Conflicted as liked the beer but in reality prefer regular Ruffian more. Might be showing its age a bit as was thin in spots and needed a lot of air to open this up. Decent enough stuff but not on par with other BA barleywines out there. Not as much substance to the body as others out there.","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"

Taste is heavy on the whisky from start to finish with the base beer coming through in the middle and showing caramel, raisin, toffee, and faded hops.  Bit of an off flavor in there as well that is hard to pin down.  I cannot say that this is infected per se but something does not quite seem right.

Bottle 792 / 1188

A: The beer appears a murky / hazy mahogany brown hue, with a decent sized head that leaves virtually no lacing.

S: Aromas include caramels, toffee, alcohol, oak, ripe dark fruits, malt.

T: The flavor is of everything found in the aroma, especially toffee, caramels, and alcohol. There is a subtle hop showing, but this barleywine is much more about a powerful malt presence and toffee candy sweetness.

M: Low carbonation and high alcohol. Smooth and creamy feel, with a pronounced sweetness throughout.

D: I was very excited to sample this limited release, and would definitely have it again. Best enjoyed in small quantities, this beer is ideal for sharing a few ways.

3061,"2012-06-01",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2013 2008 Vintage (#78/461) 750ml bottle with a bottled on date of April 08 and a 12.7% ABV compared side-by-side with a 2012 (#0860) 750ml bottle that has an 11.8% ABV. 2008  Pours a murky, deep amber, slightly orange tinted body with a finger-width, creamy, tannish beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves lots of pretty lacing. Gorgeous beer. Aroma seems a bit messy at this point. Its pretty sweet and the malts seem oxidized. The hops havent completely gone away, but only a light floral and earthy citrus note remains. A bit of an orange note from the hops mixes with lots of caramel and some toffee. There is still plenty of oak that gives off a bit of a char note, but also seems to accentuate the oxidization of the malts. A light raisin and date note along with some brown sugar. Flavor is similar with the oak really dominating while the malts dont give off the oxidization that the aroma displayed. Maybe the accidental 20-month aging helped with the oaks presence. The malts arent as complex as the fresher bottle, but they have aged nicely with lots of rich caramels, toffees, and a light molasses. A light orange comes out again from the floral and earthy hops mixing with the malts as this makes way for a big, pretty dry woodiness. The beer is sweet enough and big enough to handle the oak, but if this were any thinner the oak would be way over-the-top. A light vanilla and a bit of a whisky note mixes nicely with the oak. Some brown sugar and a touch of chocolate towards the end as some dates and raisins make their way into the mix. Finishes dry from the big woodiness and all-of-a-sudden, lots of vanilla shows up along with a sweet malt backing and light dark fruit note that isnt nearly as rich and deep as the 2012 bottle. Medium bitterness and a touch of booze before leaving a lengthy aftertaste with lots of wood and vanilla. Medium, smooth body that was probably thinned a bit from the extended aging with a soft, medium-light carbonation. Overall, I was expecting to like this bottle more than the 2012 because Ive been carefully cellaring it for four years and it was the original release, but this is no where near as good as the fresher version. This may be passed its climax or maybe it was aged too long on wood, but I did enjoy it nonetheless. The aroma seemed oxidized, but it didnt show up in the flavor. The oak is really dominant and Im guessing it was way over-the-top when this was first released, but throughout the years it seems to have blended well with the malts that have also settled into their own. I like the bigger vanilla note that comes out towards the end and despite this being thinner than the 2012 bottle, it still has a really nice palate. Im very glad to have had the opportunity to pick this up in Denver four years ago and hold onto it like I have, but if anyone still has a bottle of the original release, I would drink it now before the flavor gets oxidized (6,5,7,4,13=3.5).2012 Vintage  Pours a cloudy, deep amber, slightly orange tinted, but less so than the 2008 bottle with a finger-width, creamy, tannish beige head thats a bit lighter than the 2008 while dissipating slowly and leaving lots of pretty lacing too. Absolutely gorgeous. Aroma is awesome. Sweeter with lots of heavy caramels and some molasses along with a slight boozy note that dies after an initial whiff and plenty of aggressive hops that are floral and earthy. Pleasant oak and a light whiskey note with some rich dark fruits consisting mostly of dates and raisins. Plenty of toffees come out as this warms along with a nice vanilla, a touch of chocolate, and some brown sugar. Flavor is absolutely wonderful. Rich dates and raisins with deep caramels, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and a light chocolate up front. Lots of oak in the middle with a soft vanilla that blends so well with the sweetness of the malts. A sturdy amount of earthy and floral hops that also balances the malts while never distracting from the pleasant oak and nice whiskey note that comes out more towards the end. Finishes nicely dry from the oak and hops, but rich, deep, and sweet from the malts and dark fruits with an awesome vanilla note coming out more as this warms. Medium bitterness before leaving a lengthy aftertaste. Full, creamy, smooth body and a soft, medium-light carbonation. Overall, an absolutely breathtaking barleywine. The malts are sweet and complex, but never cloying. Lots of hops to balance, but they never distract from the malts or the barrel aging that offers plenty of oak, vanilla, and a very pleasant whiskey note. Remarkable palate and no hint of booze that reminds me that yes, I do want to drink this forever and ever and ever. Wowthis just might be the best beer Ive ever had. Drink this NOW.

More smooth and less boozy than the normal version despite the higher abv. Lots of dark fruits in the flavor and a fair amount of toffee and caramel. Smooth, toasty caramel malty, dark toffee finish.

3061,"2012-04-18",4.0,"In short: A heavy malted and woody beer that is way too easy to drink.  Excellent
How: Bottle 750ml.  First release (2009?), bottle #168/461.  Consumed when over 2 years of age.  Big tanks to Rob from Goebel for this one
The look: Cloudy bronze body topped by a persistent small beige head
In long: Nose is heavily butterscotch, alcoholised dessert and only a mild-medium barrel presence.  Taste is surprisingly not too cloying sweet, this is a 12.7% beer with the alcohol ratjer well hidden, rich caramel, some butterscotch, light notes of berries, toffee, light buttery notes.  There is a strong barrel presence but it feels like straight wood barrel and not bourbon barrels or other boozy barrels.  Here it is more like good old straight old wood barrels and it dries out the beer very nicely and adds a pleasant light astringency.  With my first glass I thought it was pretty good but then the more I drank it the more I loved it, which is exactly the opposite of the effect a monster 12.7% beer usually has on me.  Excellent beer, surprisingly I preferred this batch over the regular Old Ruffian.

An aggressive pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a fat, finger thick, amber tinged full tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated amber / brown that shows a murky, dark amber color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells strongly of bourbon, alcohol, toasted coconut, big vanillin notes, tart whiskey notes, whiskey soaked caramel, perhaps a touch of salty smokiness and a bit of sherry; these last two notes are definitely the effect of some oxidation.  The biggest notes by far in the aroma are sweetened, almost caramelized, toasted coconut and vanillin, which is followed closely by a general whiskey character; the base beer plays a distant role in the nose, which is great if you really like whiskey, but if you were looking for a Barleywine then you might be a bit disappointed (which I am a bit).  As the beer warms up, the caramelized malt portion of the aroma starts to pick up a bit; when combined with the barrel notes it almost reminds me a bit of cotton candy at times, in some weird way.  Some toasted, whole grain character also becomes a bit more noticeable in the aroma.

Bitter, slightly herbal hop flavors are anchored by a toasted and richly caramelized malt character that is enhanced by flavors of toasted coconut and vanillin.  The finish dries out with a big hop bitterness that provides quite a bite as well as some green hop astringency; this is accentuated by some woody spiciness and some warming, sometimes hot, whiskey flavors and alcohol.  The body of this beer is fairly luscious, though it has certainly significantly thinned from the base beer; the body along with the spiciness from the oak makes this a definite sipping brew though.  The hop flavor has significantly faded in this brew, but it is still a bit harsh & it makes me wonder how this was drinking when it was a much younger beer.  Towards the middle and more towards the finish there is a slightly nutty flavor that shows the touch of oxidation and there is also a touch of sherry or even wet cardboard perhaps.

This is another barrel aged beer that spent way too much time in the barrel, alternatively this should have been blended with some fresh Old Ruffian as I am really wishing the base beer came through in some way.  As it is this is purely a vehicle for the Stranahan barrels, if that is your thing then you will enjoy this beer, but if you are looking for beer then you might be a bit disappointed.  I am enjoying this beer a little bit, so it is not a complete loss, but not enough to remotely want to finish this bottle by myself (I might finish my glass).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Underlying barleywine is slightly doughy with lots of toffee and caramel and a mild spiciness. This is much less bitter than the regular fresh. Also, much of the hoppiness is gone, but a mild herbalness still lingers.

Bigger malt notes coat the mouth on the finish with the whiskey barrels coming forward on the back end.  The time spent in the wood mellows this beast of a Barley Wine and transforms it into a smooth intricate after dinner drink with lots of whiskey, oak and vanilla notes coupled with sweet malts and dark fruit notes.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"

The nose is primarily rich and malty, showing notes of dark caramel, brown butter, burnt toffee, and soft cocoa.  Remnants of earthen hops lend trace amounts of balancing bitterness, while the charred oak imparts silky vanilla and woody bourbon notes.  It simply smells fantastic, and the flavor doesnt disappoint.  Lush caramel and buttery toffee prove the perfect backdrop for the oaky, vanilla laden bourbon, and theres just enough cocoa roast and barrel char to keep the sweetness from getting out of hand.

3061,"2010-01-06",4.3,"2009 vintage.  Bottle 297/1188. Havent had the original in a while and didnt try the first barrel-aged Ruffian.  Pours with a murky, crimson-brick color with an average, beige, tight, pillowy head which is somewhat lasting and leaves a thin layer of froth but minimal lace.  Nose is still young but pleasant with toasted oak and toasted caramel, faint vanilla and cotton candy, spicy bourbon, underlying apricot, maybe floral, lightly buttery, and faint amaretto.  Kind of surprised that it is still young and not much hops noted.  The flavor is much different with some more hops noted; piney and oaky (almost rustic-like), grapefruit and apricot, toasted notes, light bourbon, spicy (almost cayenne-like), buttery toffee, and faint amaretto.  Palate is perfect with a full body, prickly but nearly soft carbonation, round, chewy, velvety, and nice warmth.  Finishes drying a bit, more than moderately bitter but seemingly more due to the spicy character, and notes of cayenne, buttery toffee, Stranahans, and some oaken vanilla with pine and spice lingering.  This is one the barrel-aged beers from GD that I think actually improved the beer.  Maybe it is the fact that I actually love the original Yeti and Hibernation and just like the Ruffian (and BW in general), but somehow the bourbon and oak notes help add depth to an intensely rich and hoppy beer.  My only wish is that GD could make these barrel-aged beers less than $25.  Awesome palate and nice flavor and one of the best whiskey-aged beers in a while.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

3061,"2009-06-22",4.0,"25 oz bottle, via crosling.  Pours a slightly hazy dark amber body with a small tight bubbled beige head that retained well.  Very thick heavy aroma, full of caramel and toffee with a good deal of whiskey and oak but it doesnt smell overly boozy.  A nice vanilla accent as well.  Rich toffee and caramel maltiness really melds well with the whiskey flavor.  Maybe a little boozy, but not overwhelming.  Fairly light woody quality but its probably just covered up by the whiskey more than anything.  Theres a good bit of resiny bitterness on the finish.  Full bodied and thick on the palate up front, the alcohol thins it a little on the finish.  Very warming all the way down the chest.  Nice light prickly carbonation cuts the body pretty well.  All in all pretty darn good.  Quite a bit better than the regular Old Ruffian.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3061,"2009-06-19",4.7,"750ml bottle. Pours a strange fecal brown with a foamy tan head. This beer does not pour like a barley wine. The aroma is of oak, whiskey, caramel, malt, chocolate, alcohol, and vanilla. The aroma is very rich in flavors and smells fantastic. The taste is of caramel malt, chocolate, grass, vanilla, and spice. Huge oak and whiskey flavors dominate the beer, but dont make it seem unbalanced. Lingering taste of oak, alcohol, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The alcohol compliments the beer very well, but turns this beer into a definite sipper. Finish is all harsh alcohol. Although it seems to have lost any barley wine characteristics in the barrel aging process, it is still an amazing beer.

3061,"2009-01-11",3.8,"Bottle #346/461 poured into a snifter.

Pours a deep, clear copper with a one-finger rock off-white head that lingered a good while leaving very good lacing.  A significant cap hangs out throughout the session.

The aroma is delicious with the normal caramel malts and toffee sweetness complemented nicely by the big bourbon and vanilla presence from the oak.  Some dark fruit sweetness and a hint of hops are present, though the hops are definitely less pronounced than in the regular Ruffian.

The taste actually seems a bit boozier than the aroma with a huge bourbon kick up front that lingers all the way to the aftertaste with an alcohol burn.  In between is plenty of vanilla and oak presence.  The underlying Ruffian is also there but the caramel malts and toffee sweetnes are really subtle underneath the powerful barrel properties.  I did get some citrus hops in the taste that I couldnt sense in the aroma.

The mouthfeel is plenty creamy with good carbonation.  The barrel presence really makes itself felt on the palate with dry wood and booze all over the place.

This is a great beer but the bourbon in the taste might be a tad too much for me (and I love bourbon).  Either way, Im glad I got the opportunity to try it.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Starting with a full body that goes down sharp with a rich feel.  Finish is big with bold flavors of sweet caramel and vanilla then a coffee like bitterness followed by some oak and whisky.  After taste is slightly dry with a whisky like feel and some alcohol.  The first few sips are a little rough but it seems to mellow as you drink it.  Overall this is a great Barley Wine, I think aging it in oak barrels mellows the hops and makes it a better and much more complex brew then the regular Ruffian.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"
3061,"2009-01-10",4.2,"750ml bottle $24.99. These expensive beers scare me. I was not disappointed that I bought this one. Nice dark brown color, darker than normal ruffian. Smells like whiskey, vanilla, hops? tastes like oak, vanilla, whiskey but subtle with hints of toffee that I get from regular ruffian. This is not just whiskey, you can actually taste the barleywine in this, nice. One small sip does warm the belly so you can feel the alcohol but it doesnt play much of a factor in the taste.

3061,"2008-12-08",3.7,"750ml bottle. No idea what the bottle number was. Pours a mostly clear brown with a moderate sized, tan head and some lace. Smells of new wood, some sweet malts and a good bit of alcohol. Tastes malty and sweet, hints of chocolate for me actually. The wood flavors I get are new and mellow. Not much bourbon, maybe just a touch of booze sweetness. Full body, good carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"
3061,"2008-12-01",3.9,"Thanks to Mike for bringing this one to Hotd dock sale. Glowing amber pour, good clarity, with a smooth light khaki head. Big oak nose, hints of vanilla and fig. The alcohol was there, but not to overwhelming. The oak was pretty strong, should mellow nicely. Pretty solid brew with a smooth palate that leaves lingering whisky notes into the finish.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3061,"2008-11-29",4.0,"750ml.  Bottle #111/461.  Pours a hazy mahogany with a small khaki colored head which diminishes to a thin collar.  Aromas of dark fruits, raisins, plums, whiskey and oak.  Heavy caramel malt, vanilla, and molasses.   Flavors again of dark fruits (raisins and plums), with lots of whiskey on the back end (not to mention heat).  Some really good hops in flavor, great malts, but definitely a hoppy barley wine.  Bottom line, great brew especially with the barrel aging, but not a $25 beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","aplusbreaks"
3061,"2008-11-20",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of Gillard. Thanks Ryan, you of course ROCK!!! Pours amber to garnet with mild haze and off white head. The aroma is full of oakiness and vanilla followed by almost no base beer notes whatsoever. The taste is much the same with big sweet vanilla notes with ribbons of oak and alcohol. Deep into the finish hints of the base beer show up if I really concentrate. I really prefer more balance in a beer. Hopefully some age will bring this together and even it out. Really glad I had a chance to try it. Thanks again Ryan.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3061,"2008-11-20",3.9,"Rating #900. Bottle courtesy of Gillard. Thanks Ryan for such a rare treat. Pours a slightly hazy golden with a one finger light tan head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is tons of freaking oak with vanilla and citrus, pine and sweet malt hiding in the finish. Taste is sweet malt, caramel, tons of oak, coconut, and a hint of citrus and pine hops. Medium mouthfeel with a strong amount of bitterness and slightly warm alcohol. The oak completely covers up the base beer but with time I could see this being amazing. Very good.","Florida, USA","afterglow"
3061,"2008-11-20",4.1,"courtesy of gillard.
What an excellent beer, you are the man Ryan, even in your speedo.
Pours amber/brown.
Aroma is oaked, and some lingering sweetness (vanilla) mixed with nice malts and light hops.
Taste. Just have to love the mix of barrel aged beer with oak. Leaves a nice fruity (apple) mouthfeel and malts, coupled with the nice wod addition and sweetness of vanilla.
I could drink this barley wine any day.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
3061,"2008-11-16",4.3,"750, capped and foiled. Thanks, acrdz! Great to finally meet you. Wow, wow, wow, this was a yummy beer. Pours cloudy medium amber with bright caramel highlights and a dense, creamy tan head. Big sweet vanilla-y bourbon nose. Amazingly, despite being rather out of balance, the tippage toward bourbon in the nose does not make it ungainly and certainly it loses nothing in attractiveness. Creamy medium body, a little low in carb due to time on that wood. Sweet and bourbony with plenty of deep toffee and caramel under. Again, the weirdly super-appealing imabalance toward bourbon persists on the mid-palate. Toffee, vanilla finish. Lovely stuff.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3061,"2008-10-31",3.0,"Bottle.

Head is initially very small, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark amber.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (cookie, caramel), lightly hoppy (resin, apricot), with notes of cardboard, wood, alcohol.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, syrupy texture, lively/soft carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

Surprisingly unfulfilling and rough. Raw wood and oxidation dominate the aroma, and there’s not a ton of other stuff to pull it out of that rut. The wood returns on the tongue, and frankly I just can’t get into this.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3061,"2008-10-31",4.2,"Bottle 176/461. Pours copper/brown, with a small, off white head. Aroma is dark fruit, caramel, vanilla, malt, and whiskey. Flavor is caramel, dark fruit, hops, vanilla, whiskey, malt, and alcohol. Much more subtle whisley presence than the BA Yeti. Should age nicely.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
3061,"2008-10-30",4.1,"Pours a hazy copper in colr, a good sized light cream head very slowly recedes.  Aroma is some nice citrus hoppiness, syrupy oranges, caramel, oakiness.  Taste follows with a good shot of whiskey and some major wood flavor.  Citrusy hops blend well with the dry and crisp woodiness, bth work to complement the sweet malts.  Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, somewhat cloying sweetness is cut very well by the strong dose of dry oakiness, bitter hops and bite of alcohol.  A very good beer that I think will improve over the next couple years.  Cold, it was a little mixed up, but as it warmed, the hoppy notes and barrel ageing characteristics worked well together.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","hoppymeal"
3061,"2008-10-25",4.1,"750 ml bottle poured a clear garnet with a small lingering ring of tan foam. Aromas of dark fruit, toffee, carmel, vanilla and light whiskey.

3061,"2008-10-21",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2008 10th rating to make the beer official.  Bottle from the brewery.  Pours thick dark amber color.  Lots of cardboard oxidized hops and booziness.  I think it hasnt aged well, or has been in the barrel too long.  Reminds me a lot of Green Flash 2nd Anniversary barley wine consumed 4 yrs old.  Low carbonation.  Aroma gets better after sitting a few minutes to a buttery malty oakiness.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
3061,"2008-10-20",2.8,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2009 Bottle.  Poured a clear, deep ruby-brown color with a thick beige head that slowly faded to a thick layer and left some spotty lacing.  Aroma of spicy bourbon oak with some vanilla and a bit of caramel malt, some light plum, and a bit of earthy hops.  Smooth, lightly spicy entry transitions into a sharp caramel maltiness with some light brown sugar and some spicy alcohol throughout leading into a sharp, abrasive earthy hoppiness and a lingering spicy bourbon finish.  Low carbonation , slick but somewhat thin on the palate, especially the finish.  Flavor is just too abrasive and a bit boozy, I didnt want to finish my glass.  Could be good in about a year, but at $25 there is no way I will find out.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"
3061,"2008-10-17",4.1,"750 Bottle 182/461.  8th rating, thank you kindly wetherel for bringing it back from Colorado.  Pours orange brown with a tan head.  Nose is oaky with a whiskey vanillahybred thing.  Taste is sweet thick and viscous.  Overall pretty nice.  A big beer in many ways but not too hot at all.  Fairly strange in some ways and awesome in others.  I like,  thanks John for brining this over.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
3061,"2008-10-16",4.3,"Bottle #223; big thanks to waolsen for sharing rating #1000 w/ me! Big fluffy head. Sugary, boozy aroma with some cinnamon and oak. Really f’n awesome. Lots of bourbon and oak, but alcohol is smooth and not sharp at all. Did a side by side with the regular, and the complete loss of hop character stuck out. Turned it into a very different beer; a better one if you ask me!","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"

3061,"2008-10-10",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2012 Cloudy and muddy dark tawny brown.  Creamy tan head sitting 1/2 inch tall in one glass, while the other has only a 1/8 inch film.  Nose is creamed vanilla, oak, and overripe fruit - plum, apricot, oranges.  Creamy and full up front, rich sticky plum, tobacco, vanilla, amaretto... more of this creamed orange and creamed plum flavor, a little of the fruity sweetness from the regular Ruffian shining through.  The whiskey character is thankfully not overdone - primarily vanilla and toffee notes compliment the rich creamed plum and nectarine fruit flavors.  A little hot in the back, creamy and frothy throughout, the extended finish really the only spot where it seems to thin out as the alcohol becomes strong.  Overall, really delicious and warming.   A subdued and quiet aged barley wine complimented by a mild bourbon presence and without an overbearing barrel character.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

A great effort.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
3061,"2008-10-06",4.1,"Great looking brew, a deep burgundy color that has lasted the entire session so far, at least 30 minutes.  Fairly nice nose has some complexity from the barrel (vanilla, whiskey, newer oak) as well as some notes from the original beer (caramel, fruit.)  Flavor is nicely balanced between original beer and oak elements.  Bold flavors of whiskey, caramel, toffee and vanilla.  Very tasty and impressive in every way.  A good beer now, but being that it is properly bottle conditioned, this ale has excellent potential.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
