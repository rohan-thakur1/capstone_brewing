1269,"2016-01-26",3.5,"Can at Prufs in Seattle. Clean, clear brown. Sweet black tea, brown malt. Some tannin. You get the bergamot straight through. Tasty.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
1269,"2015-12-26",3.4,"Pour is a clear chestnut with a small white head. Aroma is pretty much all earl grey tea. I happen to love a nice cuppa of strong earl grey so this I right up my alley. Flavor is more of sweet malt with some raison notes and then comes the bergamot from the earl grey. Finish has some black tea bitterness. Quite flavorful but then again one of these in a evening would be enough as the tea is quite strong and this is coming from someone who loves a nice black tea","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1269,"2015-12-20",3.5,"Can. Deep golden amber with one finger head. Medium body with caramel malt and some earthy hop bitterness. Aboverage for the style.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"

Flavors of earl grey tea, caramel and light earthiness with a smooth lingering earl grey tea finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
1269,"2015-12-12",2.8,"12oz can. Earl Grey tea in an ESB. This has got to be the low point in the Unchained series. Chalky factory ESB. Maybe it had some different character super-fresh, but this is stale and bland. Bland, uninspired, really weak stuff. Drinkable, not unlike a really boring Winter Warmer, Meh.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1269,"2015-11-16",3.2,"Aroma is fruit/berries and heavily perfumed apricots/tropical fruit. The flavor is apricots, tea, fruit/berries, flowers, malts and a slightly hoppy finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1269,"2015-11-11",3.6,"Can shared poured a caramel clear color no head to speak of. Interesting beer. Got a slight caramel and hop nose but the earl gray stands out as well in the flavor with a slight lemon flavor as well. With the esb I was expecting a little bitterness but the earl gray was a wonderful touch.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
1269,"2015-11-01",3.8,"Can. Pours a clear deep golden orange with a near white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of earl gray with a bit of sweet grains, a bit of bread and a touch of grass. Flavor has a nice balance of tea, sweet grains and grass with a slight bitterness in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1269,"2015-10-31",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2015 GABF 2015. Well hopped, especially in the aroma. It reminded me of Boston lager. Heavily hopped for a bitter, some malt body for balance. Very drinkable.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1269,"2015-09-26",3.2,"12 oz. can, pours a dark amber with a small white head. Aroma brings out herbal earl grey tea. Flavour is quite herbal, with earl grey tea, and lightly sweet cereal notes. Pretty subdued but nice and clean. Quite decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1269,"2015-09-26",3.5,"12oz can shared by Chris. I dont think I would have guessed there was tea in this. I really like the tea character but the beer underneath it is a bit flabby. I dont know how to describe it but I like it.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
1269,"2015-09-26",3.8,"Tea. Early grey. Hot. Thanks to bacterial for this. Clear reddish amber pour with white head. This is pretty cool - the malt base is really just a vehicle for a strong cup of fruity earl grey tea. Moderately sweet, finish is all tea. Medium body, creamy texture. This is really pretty damned fun. Plus, Im a sucker for anything TNG.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
1269,"2015-09-25",3.8,"On tap. Served a clear dark amber color with a nice off white head. Aroma of malt, some biscuit, herbal with hint of tea. Taste of malt and bit of tea. Mild bitterness and the finish is quite dry. Moderate body, with a clean feel. Hoped for a bit more malty character, but still a very good ESB.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
1269,"2015-09-23",3.8,"Pour on tap at HopCat, slightly hazy orange pour with white head, aroma brought notes of nice tea, lemon, herbal notes with a hint of bread, biscuit, slight toast. Taste was a mix of lemon, tea, nice grassy notes with a hint of fruit, touch of vanilla, hints of biscuit, finishing fairly dry, slightly sweet. Very nice!","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1269,"2015-09-22",3.8,"Pours a nice copper with a beige creamy head. Citrus, herbal tea aroma mixed with slight caramel breast malt notes. Flavor is tea and caramel malt. Slightly tannic, lingering mild bitterness. Light bodied, but nice. 5.3% and and well done!","Fargo, North Dakota, USA","Maltser85"
1269,"2015-09-21",4.3,"Poured from a cool-looking 12oz can into goblet, a mostly-clear reddish amber with sudsy beige foam, lasting with lots of nice lace. Gorgeous. Rich malts, bready, caramelly (though less so than youd expect from the depth of colour), great citrusy/earthy/flowery hop bitter balance. Excellent true-to-style ESB in its own right, plus strong but well-integrated aroma and flavour of Earl Grey tea tannins, bergamot citrus essence. Medium body, low carbonation, long-lasting mild bittersweet balance. So clever, so tasty, too bad this isnt a recurring seasonal. And bonus points for the Star Trek Captain Picard reference.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
1269,"2015-09-20",3.7,"Lots of malty bread and camel malt nicely balanced by the citrus hops. The tea fives a really nice herbal and slight pepper. Nice","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","undsioux7"
1269,"2015-09-11",3.5,"12 oz. can. Pours a dark amber with a foamy sudsy off white head. Aroma is sweet herbal tea. Taste is more herbal tea slightly bitter some citrus and smooth malt. Palate is thin clean crisp. This drinks very nice!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
1269,"2015-09-01",4.2,"355ml can. Clear amber pour, nice foamy off-white head. The tea envelops the aroma, citrus, blueberry, herb, tea, pine, orange. Really nice aroma here. Flavor is tea-forward as well, grassy, herbal, citrus, fruit loops. Finishing dry. Fantastic beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1269,"2015-08-30",3.7,"Tap; pours a clear dark copper color with an off white head; aroma of malt, tea, and some floral notes; taste is caramel, malt, and tea; finish is bitter with the tea notes being more pronounced; decent","Minnesota, USA","gopherfan99"
1269,"2015-08-29",3.9,"Tap at Mickeys in Waukee, IA. Medium copper body with an off white head. Doughy smell with some tobacco and sweet caramel. Hints of fruity pears. Taste is black tea and slightly peppery. A clean slight tobacco finish. Nicely done.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1269,"2015-08-26",4.0,"Can. Dark orange with a foamy tan head. Tea, wheat bread, dried leaves and toffee. Taste is mild with a bitter tea flavor and light bready sweetness. Body is medium with a foamy, light sticky feel. One of my favorites from the series.","St Paul, Minnesota, USA","Nsanders"
1269,"2015-08-24",3.3,"Golden with a good dense head (redeeming appearance). Frothy palate. Bitter, for sure, and a tannic, tea quality. (At Summer Beer Dabbler, St. Paul, MN)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1269,"2015-08-23",3.6,"Pours copper / amber with an off-white head. The aroama is spicy, herbal and earthy with Earl Grey fruit loops notes along with Brit ESB yeast and toasty malt. It has a medium crisp body with moderate amount of carbonation. The flavor starts with more ESB notes with earth / wood and toast, but still has underlying herbal/earthy tea notes. The finish has more of the earthy British hops. As the beer warms more of the tea taste comes through.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1269,"2015-08-20",3.5,"Tulip glass pour at Republic Uptown. Healthy froth initially that is quick to exit stage left. Light amber in color. Aroma has bubble gum and a hint of tea leaves. Smell is definitely predominantly sweet. Very thin mouthfeel. Taste is unique...surprised how much it finishes like an Earl Gray cup of tea. Bitter notes prevail which you would expect with a slightly sweet finish. Kind of reminds me of an alcoholic iced tea thats heavily sweetened. Im actually not that down on the effort. Interesting...better than I expected.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"
1269,"2015-08-14",3.2,"Not really working for me. Ive had better beers that had a tea infusion, the tea for me here actually works against the beer and leaves an off aftertaste. The wife actually did like it and said she would order one at the bar.","Minneapolis, ","Obfuscate"
1269,"2015-08-13",3.0,"Crisp copper pour. Initial gentle floral tea, cinnamon, lavender aroma. Soggy bread, sticky malt, potpourri and urinal cake overwhelm. Its bland and plain, but inoffensive. Burnt orange rinds and oversteeped iced tea (independent of earl gray), much of the unlikable crystal stuff. Flavor is a bit cleaner but still burdened by some gummy fruitiness that undercuts the woodsy, fragrant earl gray flavor. Caramel apple, hay and sweetened iced tea are stylistic constants throughout. Semi-dry texture, light astringency in the finish. Very much to style, maybe not highlighting the right things; I do enjoy the earl gray aspect.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
1269,"2015-08-07",4.1,"Deep copper color with a long lasting medium head. Powerfully floral aroma, especially lavender. Light biscuit malt flavor, immediately buried by dry tea and lavender. Hints of fruit. If I didnt know it was Earl Grey, I wouldnt guess it; really no hit of bergamot. Almost like an English Saison. Really delicious.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1269,"2015-08-07",4.1,"1/2 inch off-white head. Deep dark amber color, lightly carbonated. Aroma is sweet malts and hops, with the distinctive smell of the tea. Somewhat sweet initial taste, with the tea making its presence known in the middle with a definite, but not overpowering, contribution. It works well. The finish is clean, with the bittering coming through into the aftertaste. Some of the bittering seems to be from the tea, not just the hops, and a nice malt taste balances the aftertaste as well. A very good balance overall, with the English Bitter style coming through in the malts and yeast plus the hops lending to the aroma and the bittering, with the tea adding a nice and very distinctive difference.","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"
