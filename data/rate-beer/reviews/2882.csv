Méltóságteljes külleme mély, opálos test kivetülése, melyre mennyeien krémes, tejfehér hab kenődik egy ujjnyi vastag rétegben, a mulandóság pedig a krémhab számára voltaképpen ismeretlen fogalom. Ez alól röppennek fel aztán a szabadjára engedett csemegekosár-aromák, a mézes, mazsolás, almakompótos, finom likőrös, aszús és élesztős illatok, hogy aztán ízjegyek formájában szinte mind testet is öltsenek. Intenzív jelleggel, desszertboros hangulatban, aszalt gyümölcsös elemek nyitnak be elsőként, majd olvadnak szét krémesen a puha, mégis élénk szerkezet keretében. A kompozíció buja élesztővel fonódik be ezután, némi fahordós, boros lenyomatot kap, majd ugyanolyan üdén, mint ahogyan érkezett, az alkohol jótékony pártfogásában, megnyerő stílusban, sziporkázva, szárazan, mégis gyümölcsösen köszön le.

2882,"2016-08-15",4.8,"Le risque est toujours grand de faire maturer des bières dans des fûts de chêne. Le résultat en est trop souvent un maelstrom gustatif, intense, mais peu appréciable. En partant dun Bush de Noël, déjà riche en arôme, le pari de la Brasserie Dubuisson était donc grand. 
La Bush de Nuit présente une teinte cuivrée tirant sur le bronze, avec une effervescence moyenne et une légère mousse la surplombant saffaissant très rapidement. 
Au nez, ce qui frappe immédiatement, ce sont les notes acidulées de cerise tirant sur le porto.
A la dégustation, lattaque est directement sur le boisé, très légèrement enrichi par le malt et la levure. En deuxième, vient ensuite lexplosion en bouche. Lacidité sur des notes de cerise et de raisin prend la dominante ; le côté boisé conférant une grande puissance gustative. En final, on atteint des notes marquées de pommeau aux pointes épicées.
Léquilibre de cette bière est exceptionnelle. Les 13 % Abv ne se sentant incroyablement pas, la bonne acidité (et non le trop de sucre...ouf!) venant contrebalancer la titrage alcoolique.

Lots of fruity yeasty tones, a bunch of honey, some alcohol, sour red berries - lots of them actually. Also I get traces of both red wine and vanilla. Smells quite complex and nice. Even if it has had a few years in the bottle it still feels a bit raw and almost brutal. Not that I was expecting a mild or a bitter, but I had thought it would be a bit less in your face. Above average on the carbonation and it has a surprisingly thin oily mouthfeel. Nice red berries, lots of oak tannins, Belgian candy, warming alcohol. Lots of flavor in this, and the barrels has really made an influence. Soft dry autumn leafs, a bit of acidic lingon berries, watered down red wine vinegar and traces of something thats remaining me of the bitterness in cocoa nibs. Honey also present in the flavor.

2882,"2015-11-12",4.1,"2009 vintage. 

Pours a very cloudy, dark chestnut brown color thats completely opaque with only the faintest of copper colored edges. Half finger off-white head that immediately disappears into a very thin ring that doesnt last. Not much in the way of lacing. 

The aroma is dominated by the vinous red wine barrel character giving off lots of toasted oak and tart dark fruit notes. The oak really stands out and is somewhat charred and ashy with a toothpick-like quality but this is countered by vinous grape, sour cherry, currant, fig and other dark berries. Along with the barrel notes there are some floral hops, peppery spice and sweeter malt notes, notably caramel and toffee. Slightly syrupy/medicinal but thankfully this is overpowered by the oak and red wine notes. 

Medium bodied with a surprising amount of carbonation for the style and strength along with a really nice, dry red wine barrel flavor thats nicely integrated into the flavors of the base beer. The oak presence is dry and toasted but isnt as strong as the nose suggests. I was worried that there would be too much dry oak/toothpick flavor but this beer has the perfect amount, adding another layer of flavor without killing everything else off. The oak presence is complimented perfectly by the burgundy wine flavor which is dry but still packs a lot of sweet, vinous fruit. Hints of dark grape, sour cherry, currant and juicy blackberry along with other dark fruit notes lingering over the sweet malt backbone and subtle floral hops into a slightly dry finish. The barrel is countered by sweet caramel malt, dark chocolate and toffee as well as a touch of earthy hop bitterness in the finish. The high ABV is expertly masked, making this delicious, complex beer dangerously drinkable. Although there is plenty of alcohol sweetness, there isnt any harsh heat, just some warmth in the finish. This is a truly remarkable beer that exceeded all of my expectations, and thats saying a lot because I really enjoyed Busch Prestige. This beer is really expensive but its worth every cent. One of the best wine barrel aged beers Ive ever had and I would definitely purchase it again. Highly recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Het smaakpallet is ook zeer complex en extreem goed gebalanceerd. Met eerst smaaktonen van; rode wijn, rood fruit; druiven, kersen, aardbeien, frambozen. Daarna houtachtige tannines van eikenhout, port, sherry, aardachtige tonen, leer en bierkelder. De smaakbalans tussen zoet, zuur, bitter en droog is ongelofelijk goed. De Bush de Nuits heeft een levendige carbonatie en de alcohol van 13% is totaal verborgen. Het is een geniet bier, maar drinkt toch gevaarlijk gemakkelijk. De afdronk is droog, houtig en licht zurig, de hop lijkt getransformeerd in een zurig tannine achtig bitter. Deze Bush de Nuits is een ongelofelijk goed Belgisch bier, een van de beste, echter de Bush Prestige doet er niks voor onder. Brasserie Dubuisson maakt bijzondere bieren. Binnenkort de Bush de Charmes beoordelen!","Waalwijk, NETHERLANDS","Batavi"

Sweetish malty taste with a kind of lactic acidity coming up shortly after, drying the sweetness; rounded, smooth maltiness, finishing in a warm oak woodiness and warming, port-like alcohol.

and some sour ones as well, portwine barrel, nutmeg sweetness - seems like a lot going on here. One of the 
most intriguing ones in a while so far. Sweet nutty notes, red wine barrels, some oak, candy sweetness and some apples might be there as well in taste. This one is near perfection, havent tasted something like this before as theres just so much going on. And its so smooth and good tasting, loving every aroma note and sip I take to the last bit. A bit of tartness, some sweetness and light vinous notes are present towards the end.

fruityness this one has to offer.","FINLAND","RexTalionis"

2882,"2013-09-06",4.0,"750mL bottle, 2008 vintage. Poured cloudy, deep amber with a beige head that fizzled out fairly quickly. The aroma picked up tart vinous notes, nutmeg, vanilla, black pepper, and a hefty dose of oak over rich dark fruit, molasses, and aged caramel malt.. just a kiss of spruce right on the back of the nose.. quite warm, but excellent balance. The flavor opened with tangy fruit skins, oak, and vinous notes with slick molasses, vanilla, and dark fruit meat behind.. lovely peppery and earthy vinous notes laced throughout.. belly-warming on the finish.. carbonation fell off just a bit too quickly, but it was still great.

5/11/2011: Scaldis Prestige de Nuits... Aroma: Carmelized pear and lots of brown sugar; fruity and sugary. Appearance: Dull golden brown color; cloudy with swirling carbonation and sediment; quite bubbly with a foamy beige head. Flavor: Sharp sweetness up front, but not cloying; sugary caramelized fleshy fruits; white grapes, raisin, Hawaiian breadiness, vanilla, touch of sourish cherry or red wine; high alcohol with a touch of floral/herbal hoppiness in the dry finish. Palate: Medium-bodied; well-carbonated, but not fizzy since the beer is heavier than the regular Scaldis Prestige. Overall: This is big beer that hits hard, but the sweetness and flavor makes it so easily approachable.

2882,"2013-06-22",5.0,"Tasted several times, ""vintages"" 2009 and 2010. Could I find a reason not to give this beer a straight 5? The foam top may not be in accordance with the rule, but this is not your everydays beer either. The sensation from savouring this beer is one of utter delight. Awesomely complex nose where a ripe expression of malt ties in with black currants, marc de Bourgogne and fine herbal tones, also displaying liveliness and freshness. That ""peacocks tail"" of aromas is carried forward in the mouth, continuously changing, always balanced and refined. To be sure, this is not beer that attempts to taste like wine, if anything, it proves brewing beer can reach the state of Art.

2882,"2013-06-16",5.0,"Bière de triple fermentation réalisée au départ de la Bush de Noël.
Nous sommes ici dans les sommets de la technique au niveau du brassage et du mûrissement.
Des foudres de Nuits St Georges pendant 6 mois minimun (on sen apercevra très vite
à la dégustation...) puis un séjour en chambre chaude. Une magnifique bouteille de type Champagne (en 75 cl bien sûr), du lettrage en sérigraphie, bouchon de liège, ferrure dorée, 
et une teneur alcoolique de 13 % abv.... On est dans les hautes sphères...
Couleur brun roux tendre assez spécifique à la Noël.
Clarté un peu de trouble par la levure incluse lors du débouchage.
Bulles moyennes partout et encore vives (mon exemplaire est du millésime 2009).
Mousse beige qui tombe assez vite (normal vu le niveau abv).
Arômes très vineux (déjà au nez de la bouteille), du fût, de la muscade, des fruits rouges et noirs.
Volume soyeux à doux de la 1ère bouche où le vignoble rejoint la brasserie dans un mariage
parfait. Du bois dabord, des fruits, du raisin à la pourriture noble, du malt (dans le vrai sens du
terme). Arrière-bouche sur les cerises noires et le cassis.
2ème bouche où on a le vin en direct, du tonneau de Nuits...Arrière-bouche à la belle myrtille.
3ème bouche assez indéfinissable   on dira en résumé que cest du style malt à whisky qui
rencontre des foudres de chêne au milieu de Nuits et qui parle dhistoires de bières ales belges
fortes. On est donc en pleine histoire européenne  (Ecosse, Bourgogne, Wallonie  ou si
vous préférez UK/France/Belgique).
La longueur nous fait découvrir les raisins secs, des fruits confits (abricots, poires), du single
de Talisker, des épices thaïes, du santal, du moût de Bourgogne, du marc de Jurançon.
La levure est un pur produit Dubuisson, très noble.
Lalcool est bien progressif, sans excès, mais ferme et vigoureux, pour soutenir toutes ces
saveurs merveilleuses.
La finale est un développement sans fin, ou comme disent les musiciens classiques,  des
variations nombreuses sur le même thème.
Conclusion : du grand art, de lart du brassage dabord puis de lart dans le mûrissement.
Quelle leçon de bière nous donnent ainsi ces brasseurs anciens des Belgian Family.
Une pure prouesse technique et gustative. Merci Dubuisson. 
(Pour lanecdote, sur 256 cotes, incroyable mais vrai, cette bière navait pas encore de 5 !!!
Je suis donc particulièrement fier de lui décerner ce trophée absolument indiscutable...

2882,"2012-11-03",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Apple cider and farmhouse character seep from this Barrel-Aged Belgian Strong Ales aroma, leading to wooden intensity, bubblegum and alcohol warmth.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the misty red.
-Fruitiness is also redolent of black cherries.
-The soft prickling of carbonation makes the beer feel even more intense flavor-wise.
-Wooden tannins are prominent throughout.
-I was expecting more elegance from the Nuits St-Georges barrel; this is very flavorful, but perhaps too brash to truly be world-class. Too expensive too for my wallet.

A little to dry but a well joined up enjoyable beer. 8th December 2016Bottleshare at Leightons Gaff. Thanks to Leighton.

2882,"2012-03-25",4.2,"I had two entirely different sets of reactions.  When i had my first glass I thought of a slightly fizzy slightly sweet red wine spritzer and was not impressed.  An hour later the same beer was delightful.  Is it possible that a red wine barrel aged beer needs to breathe?  Who knows.  Here is my second set of impressions.  Appearance is perfect.  Indeed, the appearance of the bottle is so perfect that the appearance of the beer hardly matters, but that is perfect also, like a slightly hazy, reddish tripel, but with a very small tan head.  Nose is complex but simple to describe, malts and Burgundy wine.  Taste is complex and simple as well, Belgian tripel, without the floral, lavender, lilac notes of the basic Prestige, but with complexity from from the Burgundy again.  I thought it was great, obviously, but I docked it a point for being over 10% alcohol and another point for its price.  13% ABV makes a beer scary dangerous, and $39.96 for a single bottle of beer, purchased at the case price, is just too high.  And yet, Im glad I have the rest of the case waiting for me!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"

Set it aside for a Christmas Day special, sadly.  It smelt and tasted of oxidised wine up front, I guess because that is what was left in the cask.  This clashed with the partially fermented, naieve, sweet, said-not-to-be-spiced barley wine.  The effect was similar to spreading crumbled mature Stilton cheese over Corn Flakes and adding sour milk with Canada Dry.

2882,"2010-10-15",3.6,"Sampled July 2010 at De Heeren van Liedekercke
For the last beer of the night, we decided to put ourselves in the capable hands of Joost.  We decided to start out tasting the beer blind and see what showed up in our glass.

The beer is nice and cold on this hot summer night.  It has a certain mustiness to it and even a touch of tartness that seems almost acetic somehow and there is definitely a caramelized grain note to it.  The beer has a frothy, tan tinged, light colored head.  The body is a dark, burnt amber color that shows a clear amber color when held up to the light.  Aromas of raisins, prunes, proper caramel note, suggestions of woody mushrooms, hints of tobacco, quite nutty smelling at times and there is even some heat from alcohol towards the finish after a bit.

The beer tastes sweet and fruity in a non-descript way up front and the finish is a bit astringent.  Touches of childrens aspirin, concord grape, raisins, dates and cherry (last seems accentuated by a light acetic note) are all noticeable in the flavor.  This finishes with some heat that warms my esophagus. The beer is actually somewhat light body for its strength.  It really does have a nice nuttiness to it and the alcohol becomes much more apparent as the beer warms up.  The fruity notes are quite nice and seem to be the signature of the wine-barrel character.

This was a perfect end to an afternoon / evening of enjoying fantastic food and great beer at De Heeren van Liedekercke.  This is best described as a big glass of wham that sent me overly satiated to stumble up stairs to sleep.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2882,"2010-09-13",4.1,"In short: A very vinous, very oaky, very tannic and surprisingly easy to drink beer.  Wow.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed around 8 months after the beer release.  Tasting session with Montreal crew.  Bottle sent to me by tytoanderso, thanks a lot Tyler
The look: Cloudy amber body topped by a medium beige head
In long: Interesting nose of oak, grapes and cherries.  Taste is very vinous, more than vinous, this is fresh grapes.  Some other fruits such as bananas (really!) in there too.  The oak is very strong in this one and it really dries out the beer.  Lots of tannins too.  Very dry finish.  Yet despite its strong oaky sourness and tannins character I thought the beer was rather easy to drink.  No alcohol presence whatsoever.  A great beer to go with a full meal.  The problem is the very high price tag on this baby.

2882,"2010-08-23",3.4,"Bottle: Poured a murky red/beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing.

Taste is also a mix between a lightly sweet non-descript malt base with tart notes and a vinous feel from the wine barrel. Body was quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I must say I was disappointed by this one  I am not sure the wine barrel brought anything more that I appreciated. I was expecting more sour notes as opposed to some grapes. The price tag is another factor probably not helping.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
2882,"2010-08-12",4.3,"09 vintage. Dark brown pour with a good-sized, frothy white head. Aroma holds definite notes of wine at the start, then shifts to massive components of raisin, prune, date, sweetbread, candied sugars, caramel, and molasses-- classic Belgian strong, but with increased wine presence. Flavor is lighter and carries more of the wine barrel aging-- plum, nectarine, oak, bready Belgian yeast, and a beautiful presence of Cointreau and red raspberry at the finish. Palate is smooth and luscious, but you can definitely feel the bite from the 13% ABV, though its welcomed. Very very nice brew.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

Medium-thin mouthfeel, long vinous finish that transitions to malt, which then comes through very strongly.

Somehow I thought that not even something as romantic as seven months on Burgundy casks could rescue this beer. I was wrong. They completely rescued it. It turns out that the added oaky, tart-and-vinous complexity, which is really not so subtle, is exactly what Bush needs to better suit my taste buds. Whiskeyish aspects there too. Good night.

Aroma was not as strong as i expected but neither is the Bush Premium which is probably the cleanest 13% beer ive had.  I was outside so that may have detracted as well.  Most evident was the additional aroma of wine, which was expected and got me really excited about tasting it.  The appearance was darker and more reddish than the Premium but still looked pretty clean.  Head was lively at first but dissipated quickly.  Flavor was fantastic- tart berries stood out the most- cherry, raspberry, dark grapes,  It was somewhat sweet and not as dry as you might think after aging in burgundy casks.  It was certainly vinuous though.  Wonderful palate- plenty of smooth carbonation made the fruits dance on the tongue and there was even a hint of creaminess.  What a great beer.

Dark fruit is the primary aroma, with nuances of wood and some vinous quality. Flavor begins with raisin and malt, which are complimented by berries, red wine, chocolate and wood. Long finish, with dark fruit, wood, and wine. Very nice beer. Thanks, Greg!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
2882,"2008-12-25",4.6,"It is red-brown (most red) with a small head. Wow, the aroma sweeps me off my feet. It is vinous with notes of fruits (dark and lighter ones), a light sourness and vinegar (like in the very best sour beers), a light sweetness, malt and raisin. The flavour has sweetness and a pleasant sourness, notes of wood, red wine, fruit, raisin, figs, grapes, malt, caramel and light citrus. The balance is unique, this clearly is one of the very best Belgian beers I have had.","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"

2882,"2008-12-05",4.0,"Bottle shared by Brad.  Thanks dude!  Pours a nice deep amber almost brown color with a typical nice high tight carbonation and a nice fluffy head, fades a bit though.  Aroma is nutty, moderately sweet with caramel malts, very light on the oak and wine,  light burnt toast, figs, dates, raisin, and other fruity esters with a nice herbal leathery hint which was nice as well.  Flavor is nice and doughy- good bunt  and lightly charred malts, fresh Vienna toasted malts, light Belgian candy sugar, lightly phenolic Belgian yeast with good herbal and earthy character and a nice light dry and lightly tannic finish.  Pretty good overall, but not really mind-blowing.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

2882,"2008-10-31",4.6,"Bottle. [Tasting session @ Papsoe, 31-10-2008] Average lovely off-white thick head that mostly lasted. Good display of lacework. Cloudy nutty color. Complexity was really striking with notes of almost Champagne mixed with strong notes of fruit and a surprisingly barnyard - woody like sour notes. Also wood, yeast and mild malt. Also peach and spice mixed in a lovely way. Unbelievable that this is 13 % alcohol. Full bodied with an average carbonation and somewhat dry woody and yet smooth texture. Heavy sweet flavor with mild sharp bitter notes. Lingering fruity and warming alcoholic finish.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"

2882,"2008-10-24",3.2,"courtesy of Pascal Sauser - cloudy brown colour, little beige foam; very straight notes of wood; vinous and with a touch of vinegar; some astringence, sweet and full-bodied; acidic and quite aggressive; sweetish woody and malty caramleish aftertaste - deeply lacking of subtlety and without complicity between the beer and the cask; definitely needs some ageing","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"

Enormous alcoholwarming, very smooth alcoholy. Still 14% seems very heavy because of the acids. Terribly promising, vinous , this is going to be unbeatable in 1.5/2 years.
