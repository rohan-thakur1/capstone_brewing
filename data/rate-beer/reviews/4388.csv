I dont believe Westbrook is known for lagers - skepticism was high going into this one. This one has a heavier than expected smoky nose, with nutty undercurrents and mild fruit esters. The flavor profile falls flat here - muddled roasty notes move forward to bittering rye grain and feint cocoa. This beer excels at marketing, but I could do without it.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Body is medium to heavy (heavier than I would expect for a lager) and totally, totally smooth. Taste is same as nose but the rye definitely comes through for me- even at only 10% of the brew.

4388,"2012-05-17",3.9,"Bottle Pours black with a huge, frothy, cappuccino head that never fully dissipates. The aroma is straight-up café con leche accompanied by a big hunk of fudge. Very, very nice. Full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and dancing carbonation. The flavor is of unsweetened dark chocolate, espresso and a touch of carbonic charcoal. Finishes crisp, burnt, moderately bitter, and then presents a lingering, spicy dryness. Borderline world class beer. Terrific for a Schwarzbier. Bottle generously provided by ElliesBrown.  Zacks good people!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

4388,"2012-04-13",3.0,"Bomber from Charleston Beer Exchange. HUGE burst of carbonation as the bottle was opened but it didnt gush. Pours a very dark brown, nearly black, with a large frothy tan head. Average head retention. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, floral notes, faint toastiness and rye. The taste is chocolate and roasted malts, rye, nutty notes and a mildly hoppy finish. Thin-medium bodied, very dry and VERY highly carbonated. I think this would be much better without so much carbonation.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

From the smell I would expect it to be very thick.  It is not; very light and easy to drink.  High carbonation, really quality schwarzbier and the first of this brewer for me.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
