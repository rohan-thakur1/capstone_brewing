3295,"2013-01-14",3.9,"Draught at Spezial in November, 2011 (on the hill): Lightly hazed chartreuse. Creamy, beaming-white head. Vibrantly hopcentric nose of lemon and pepper with accompanying sea air, haylike pils malt, and spruce tips. Wonderfully pungent, perfumey and elegant.  Pillowy carbonation. Very natural in texture. Highly quaffable from the start as hops immediately unleash their  herbal and spicy bitterness amid a salty mineral tinge which accentuates the dryness. Mild toastiness is present, though the malt is very clean with a feathery delicateness. Very complex and elegant hop character soars and zings with a minty and spicy interplay along with lots of  bright grassiness and lemon zest bitterness. Champagnelike. Plenty of nectar to cover the palate and deepen the sharper, more herbaceous hoppiness. Trace lemon candy sweetness, but predominantly bright and zesty with some sprucelike accents, to boot. Rustic yeast signature adds heft to the core. Pils malt provides a beautifully sharp, firm, and dry crackery base. Closes dryly malty and staunchly mineralic with light a flowery succulence but largely zippy and vivaciously peppery with resounding lemony afterthoughts. A dazzling example of liquid harmony. Has pretty much everything I love about Franconian brewing, from the luxurious display of Tettnanger  and skillfully extracted pils malt right down to the pronounced yeast bite.

One of the last beers I got to taste before heading out of this wonderfully picturesque, almost unspoilt town, before continuing south to the states beer capital - München.
Into a stein glass. Hazy, straw-gold in body. Very finely, intermittently carbonated, rising to a half inch of sticky,  condensed white foam that held out and laced wildly down the glass. Aroma, like all Kellerbiers, was complex but this one was more definable than others. Damp, mown grass pierced the ol-factories first before waning to reveal some fresh chopped herbs, ripe fresh squeezed lemon and limes, and a waft of gritty, dusty pale malts underneath. In the mouth it is soft but full of life, inkling and entering every corner of the mouth like it owns the palate. A wonderfully gripping base of summer malts settles in first, before some ripe, tart and tight fruits and the sweeter edges of mango and grapefruit make themself comfortable. Body is light but firm and it is rather smooth, even creamy as it heads for the tonsils and then south. A little sour malt shines across the sides of the tongue. In the back it has a depth of spicy, grassy and herbal hop tones that give it a nice bitter, biting edge before it drops off with a long malt and hop swallow that has just a little more fruit. Very quenching stuff. It remains good for the length and seems to get more complex as it warms showing some pine-nuts, pale honey and peat on the tongue that linger well as it goes. Lovely stuff, one to surely bring pale lagers up a notch. A superb Kellerbier.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Way too complex for the style.  I think this has the potential to be rather bland after a while, but it has good character.  Bit of breadiness, too.

-A sticky foam recedes to a ring on the cloudy golden brightness.
-A few love handles in the mouthfeel, tons of wet hay to bite into, aided by the natural carbonation of course.
-Herbal hops and cereals just understated enough; mind you, the mouthfeel is so comfortable they must be in awe.
-Finishes pretty softly, with herbal hop flavors and bitterness, although slightly higher levels would have been lovely.
-This landbier could not be better balanced. This is a fantastic piece of fresh bread. Another high quality product from Spezial.

3295,"2006-01-30",4.5,"Enjoyed many a half liter at the brewery pub in Bamburg, Germany. This beer is an unfiltered pils, and similar to St. Georgen Brau Kellerbier. This beer pours to a opaque, pale golden color with a white head that fades, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting with herbal/grassy hop aromas, and hints of crisp pilsner malt. The palate is soft and round with good pale malt flavors, on a smooth and drinkable body.  Spezial Ungespundet finishes with good pilsner malt flavor up front, then ends with a nice grassy hop bitterness that lingers. This beer is outstanding, very fresh, and very flavorful tasted on draught at source. It was a great beer to enjoy with a lunch of sauerkraut and bratwurst.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
