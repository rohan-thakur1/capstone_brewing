Medium body. Moderate to medium carbonation. A bit oily mouthfeel. Warming but never burning chili peppers finish with lingering but not overpowering roasted and chocolatey notes.

W żadnym miejscu nie ma jakiegokolwiek prześwitu innego koloru.
Piwo przy nalewaniu jest gęste jak olej silnikowy. 

Piana: Ciemno beżowa, wpadająca w brąz, bardzo gęsta.
Piana złożona jest z małych i średnich pęcherzyków powietrza.
Bardzo dobry lacing z licznymi malunkami na krawędziach kielicha.

Zapach: Zaraz po zrzuceniu kapselka do nozdrzy dostaje się solidna dawka gorzkiej i mlecznej czekolady. Następnie owocowa nuta od ciemnych owoców (jeżyny). Po chwili trochę paloności i lukrecja.
Pikantna nuta chilli bardzo subtelna i poczułem ją dopiero za ""nastym"" razem.
Po kliku niuchach przewinęła się woń prażonego słonecznika, znana bardziej ze stylu Black IPA.

Smak: Po pierwszym przełknięciu : kremowa, słodka czekolada, kawa, leśne owoce (ponownie jeżyna i czarna jagoda).
Czuć także ziarnistość i tak jak w aromacie prażony słonecznik.
Papryczki Chipotle przychodzą na samym finiszu. Są bardzo wyraźne i fajnie drapią w gardło.
Ich stężenie jest mocno zauważalne. Przez kilka miniut po każdym łyku czuć jeszcze w gardle ich obecność.
Niemniej jednak jest to tak rozkoszne doznanie, że z przyjemnością sięga się po kolejny łyk.
Na języku na dobre zadomowił się także karmel i szczypta toffi.
Goryczka ciężka do zidentyfikowania przez obecność chilli. Wydaje się dość wysoka.
Pijalność pomimo tej pikanterii zdumiewająco wysoka.

Wysycenie: Niskie.

Podsumowanie:

To piwo jest jak narkotyk. Silnie uzależnia. Dodatek pikantnych papryczek chilli Chipotle spowodował, że piwo to stało się wręcz unikatowe. Fantastyczny gęsty, oleisty wywar o najczarniejszej barwie. 
Pikantność powinna odrzucać, a ona wręcz przeciwnie - przyciąga i człowiek z chęcią sięga po każdy kolejny łyk. Balans poszczególnych składowych idealnie współgra. Doskonałe!","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

543,"2015-12-21",3.7,"Bottle, shared by me... in my dining room... just now.
Pours pretty dang black with a fairly loose tan head that leaves some spotty lacing on the glass.

The aroma is roasty and lightly sweet with a mild smokiness. Unfortunately its got a sort of metallic thing happening as well which sort of brings the entire experince down a notch. 

The flavor picks up where the aroma lacks... lots of caramel and roastiness, a sligtly over ""medium"" level of sweetness, and some rich chocolate character. To say the least the chipolte is pronounced here, however this is not a ""spicy"" beer... at least not in the way that most hot pepper beers are. Yes, its got some chili spiciness, and its got some great smoky character... it screams chipotle without being so dominated by the chipolte character that it ruins the complexity thats going on here. 

I have to say, the Eagle Rare barrel aged version of this impressed me a lot solely on the palae and mouthfeel, considering the ABV on this beer (and that version) this pulls off the viscocity of a top class imperial stout, which is so chill and so confusing. Full bodied to the point of thick, but without such a syrupy character that it sits too heavy on the palate.

This one smells like it could be a bit disappointing. The roast and chocolate highlight it. The flavor is smoke and fruit. Not a dark or hidden fruit, but a bright tropical fruit. There is a bit of chili on the back end that tie it together, but the smokiness is a huge turn off. I'm not feeling the smoke.

Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, smoked pepper, caramel, toast, dark bread, light licorice/molasses/char, pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, chipotle pepper, and moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, smoked pepper, caramel, toast, dark bread, light licorice/molasses/char, pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of herbal/pine bitterness and pepper spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, smoked pepper, caramel, toast, dark bread, pine, light char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, chipotle pepper, and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Some light-moderate drying bitterness and pepper spice after the finish. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. A mild amount of pepper heat builds up on the finish as you finish the glass, but never gets too strong. Overall this is an awesome pepper spiced porter style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, chipotle pepper, and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced pepper spiciness. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Part of the 2014 Mikkeller LCBO feature. The beer pours a dark brown with black edges and a dark brown creamy cap. The aroma is roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, molasses and peppers.

Aroma of dark and roasted malts, roast is medium, coffee and chocolate cake notes, a little smoke and chipotle heat as an undertone. On the palate, slightly sweet dark malt core, with a dark fruitiness, black coffee, moderate to high roast, a little coffee, smoky, chipotle flavor and moderate heat. The beer is quite dry from the middle on, heat from chipotles prominent and drying, some flavor and smoke too, dry roast bitterness supports that character. Finishes with a soft lingering burn from the peppers in the mouth and on the lips. Moderate body with moderate carb. Definitely a chili beer, this, but its a well balanced one with the porter body being just robust enough. I liked the way the nose conveyed chipotles without heat, and the palate had that nice heat in the mouth without burning the throat or stomach.

543,"2014-11-17",4.5,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 50 degrees F.

A: Pours an inky black with tinges of dark brown, forming an impressively thick dark tan head that leaves equally impressive lacing down the glass.

S: Rich notes of dark chocolate and smoky roasted malt swirl out of the glass, mingled with some hints of spicy heat and dark fruits like cherry and plum.

T: The dark roasted malt forms the backbone of the flavor, smoky and black, with a complex mixture of cocoa and light coffee whirling around the palate. There is spiciness present from the chipotle, but not overly pronounced - more a background singer, offering some harmonic support to the rest of the beer. Notes of cherry and plum come through as well.

M: Heavy, sticky, this completely avoids the watery issues many porters have.

O: An enjoyable experience. I dont know if Ill repeat it at the price point of a Mikkeller beer around here, when I can grab at least two bottles of Wulver for what this runs, but that takes nothing away from this beer.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Nothing particularly noteworthy about the aroma - it smells like a stout.

The flavour is moderately sweet up front with chocolate malty notes and touches of earth and herbal hops. A distinct spiciness enters in the middle and builds towards the finish, imparting a mild chill heat. In the background, roasted malts, chocolate and perhaps a touch of espresso continue to develop, along with soft herbal hops. The finish is long and roasty, with a mild spiciness. On the palate, it is full in body with a smooth, creamy texture and average carbonation. Overall, a nice stouty ale with a significant peppery accent.

Nose is intoxicating - its dark bittersweet chocolate with roasty malts, some spiciness and certain vanilla subtlety, some hoppiness, and faint notes of tart red berries deep there too. Taste begins with a surprisingly smooth, sweet chocolate that the hot spiciness of chipotle quickly crashes into. The chipotle intensifies during many seconds, then calms down to leave a spicy / hoppy, near-burnt warmth in the throat.

Pitch black body, small brown head. Aroma of spices, coffee, roasted malt and some grass. Refreshing taste, chocolate at first, than some chili. Soft carbonation, medium body, bit creamy.

543,"2014-08-10",4.3,"Nagyon sötétbarna, olajszerű tömémény a lézet. A hab csodás barna, mint egy jó presszókávé teteje. Illata kávé, csoki és vaniliafagyi egyszerre. De nem tömény nem szemtelen mennyiségben. A gyümölcsös élesztő plusz a komló ott van a háttérben, elől meg a hamus karakter nyomul 1000-rel. Testes, sűrű de érdekes mert eléggé szénsavas is ami kell, különben túl sok lenne. Nagyon visszafogott a csilizés, kell pár korty, hogy elkezdjen dolgozni de nagyon kellemesen csíp a nyelv hátulján. A vége erősen keserű, ragadós szirupos (nem édes) ragasztja a szánkat és mire mindet megisszuk érezzük, hogy kemény az ital, tökös, mint a névadó texasi rendfenntartó.

Taste is smoky up front with some more barbecue pepper-y spices that come rushing in. Not so much ""hot"" or tingly, but quite flavorful. Roasted malts structure everything, light char & ash with more BBQ sauce, chipotle spice, & smoked peppers lingering in the aftertaste. A very interesting beer.

543,"2013-09-09",3.7,"From a 12.7oz bottle. Pours jet black with a thick tan to medium brown head. It has a light aroma which is of malt with hints of chocolate and coffee. The palate is surprisingly thin for a porter of this opacity. It is medium light bodied with very moderate carbonation. Taste is interesting, the chiplotle spiciness is relatively subdued (a good thing). Tastes primarily of malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, with less bread-like flavor than a normal porter. Very light if any hop bitterness. This finish has the slight lingering sweetness of the malt but primarily dominated by the mild burnt coffee-like roasted malt bitterness and a slight, but lingering spiciness of the chipotle. Not bad but not great. There is no alcohol heat to the flavor which is understandable for only 6.5ABV. A surpassingly low ABV for this brewer, effectively making this a Mikkeller session beer. Not a bad porter, but then I had low expectations. A good, but not great beer.

543,"2013-06-14",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2014 This is the most viscous looking beer Ive had in a very long time: the pitch black liquid barely drips out the bottle! A large, creamy and very dense head with a scary dark brown colour forms easily and stays big for a long time before settling as a thick layer. Lots of foam is still clinging to the glass after the Texas Ranger is gone. The aroma is very strong and not surprisingly on the malty side. Its heavily roasted with dark caramel, coffee and liquorice, some fainter chocolate and in the back I get traces of fruits and berries and even some juicy tobacco. Delicious! I cant say I pick up any chilli in the aroma, but the chipotle certainly is obvious in the flavours! Especially in the long, moderate bitter aftertaste, the burning chilli makes this a beer you dont hurl down, this is definitely a sipper. The initial taste is moderate sweet, and this soothes the palate for a while, until the next wave of chilli attacks. Other flavours include roasted notes, coffee and liquorice, and more pronounced notes of chocolate and tobacco that I found in the flavours. I also get vague hints of leather. The mouthfeel (and throat feel!) is very rough due to the chilli, and in the beginning it was actually a bit unpleasant. Further down in the glass Im slowly getting used to the roughness. The body is full, the texture is very oily and slick, the carbonation is soft. A wonderful and intense beer, although its a bit demanding. The most demanding part is of course all the googling thats involved: how to pronounce ""chipotle""?

The chipotle is obvious on the nose, but not to the point of burning. Lots of malt, some burnt, underneath.
Decent porter flavors: soft malt, dark bread and burnt malt.
But the reason we all came here was for the chipotle; and it does not disappoint. Mellow at first, with a slow rising heat until it is minutes since the last drink and you can still feel the heat on your lips. For a pepper beer, top marks.

Brune, col fin crémeux beige.
Arôme est épicé laissant une belle place aux piments, le tout reste fleuri et donne un bouquet houblonné qui se balance avec le Chipotle.
En bouche, mariage parfait entre malt grillé, léger choco avec en fin de bouche un réchauffant épicé de piments. Le tout nest pas surfait.
Personnellement jadore.

Deep, dark black with just the slightest touch of a russet colour in the dimple with a coffee coloured head that sat thickly to the sides of the glass. Smells deeply of chocolate malt, molasses and coffee with just a hint of green chilli there. In the mouth it is thick, viscous, oily and silky and after the first sophisticated chocolate malt flavour theres a fiery onslaught of chilli heat. It isnt overwhelming, but you know its there.

It would go nice with some sausages. Rather complex. Would be great even without the peppers, but this was incredible and different.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was basically opaque black in the glass with a large, light brown head that mostly diminished, but kept a decent sheet and left excellent lacing. The aroma had moderate to heavy roasted malt, dark chocolate, cocoa, and chocolate milk; maple syrup; and hints of pepper and spice (but that might be my imagination.). The initial flavor was spicy, light to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, slightly bitter and slightly sour; while the finish was moderately sweet, lightly bitter, spicy, and lightly sour with a long duration, especially on the spices. There was chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, chocolate syrup, spicy peppers, dark chocolate, cocoa, slight burnt malt, a little dark fruit, sausage spices, caramel and sour coffee. The medium to full body was leaning toward full. It was silky and then a bit dry with soft yet tingly carbonation that intensified when the spice started to effect the tongue. It also had a dry and spicy finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Pours black with a really nice tan head--very cream with good spotty lacing and a really thick collar. The nose is slightly roasted with a nice chipotle afterburn. Slight roasted malt character underneath. The taste, however, is all chipotle on the first sip. Pretty intense. Nothing too terrible or wrong with it other than that it is not really balanced out by roasted malt, chocolate, or anything else. This is just quite one-dimensional. Finish has a bit of actual chipotle taste with some burn in the finish. Medium body with little balance. Okay, but I think they could have made this much better.

The appearance is absolutely the best I have ever seen. It is a stunning looking beer. As it pours it TRULY looks like motor oil. It is pitch, pitch black with a HUGE awesome looking head that is a gradient of sparkling tan. It is large, billowing, pillowy, but shiny. It sticks for a good while before receding to globs of lacing.

The smell is very interesting. Lots of smoke, some chili pepper, not spicy though. There is some chocolate as well. Yes, maybe even bacon, but mainly because of the smokiness.

Teh first noticeable part of the flavor is the thick mouthfeel, this beer is only 6.6 but it has the richness of a 12 percenter, but without an overbearing alcoholic tinge. The flavor is primarily a smoky american porter which is very nice. The peppers are there but arent spicy at all. It is like the chocolates you get with cayenne in them. This one lacks any sort of spiciness despite its use of peppers. It is a smooth, exotic american porter done extremely well.

543,"2011-01-28",3.0,"Bottle.  Poured a black color with a thick, dense, creamy tan head that slowly receded to a thick fluffy layer while leaving large spots of lacing.  Aroma of bakers chocolate, lightly roasted malt, bread (rye?), a soft earthiness, and some dry pepper.  Smooth, lightly bitter entry that leads into a moderate roasted maltiness with some hints of light bakers chocolate that leads into a lightly dry earthiness paired with a moderate chalkiness that is overtaken by lightly spicy pepper note that lingers into the finish and becomes a tad overbearing before a light, sweet breadiness peaks through and tries to salvage some of the flavor.  Light carbonation and relatively slick mouth feel.  Overall, the appearance and aroma are pretty promising, but the lingering, harsh flavor leaves a pretty fair amount to be desired.  I am not sure if its the peppers that are imparting the chalking, almost medicinal flavors or not, but I am not a fan of that.  Bummer.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"

543,"2011-01-19",4.0,"Excellent, dark pour for the style with a nearly black body and a full, dense, creamy, dark tan head which is very nearly fully lasting and leaves thick, frothy lace rings.  The nose is smoky like the chipotle pepper (almost rauch-like), dark breads, burnt caramels, bakers chocolate, light chocolate malt (malt as in malt flavoring, not grain), faint chocolate cake, and a roasted coffee bean note in there as well.  The flavor is different with less smoke and more roasted presence; similar chocolate malt notes, chocolate cake and Hersheys chocolate syrup, light tones of smoky French roast coffee beans, and burnt caramels.  The palate is medium to full, very dry but still round and silky, and soft to lively.  The finish is very long, especially for a 6.6% beer with rich notes of burnt caramel and dark chocolate, dry restrained roast almost with a cedar-like quality, and ultimately the spiciness of the chipotles leaving a mild burn on the tongue, like a good chile or salsa.  Very intriguing beer with all the notes of the pepper (smokiness in the nose, heat in the finish) but never even being more than a complementary note in the beer.  Odd how you really got the smoky notes in the nose, not much in the beginning of flavor progression but all the heat on the tongue as the porter notes disappear.  The pepper notes worked very well with the base beer adding a unique complexity instead of clashing or contrasting.  Very likable beer, even for people who are not big chipotle pepper fans.  Mikkeller does amazing work.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Its a good smell for a porter, but Im worried that the ""fire"" from the chipotle wont be strong enough.  My initial thoughts after the first sip are similar, until the hot and smoky chipotle hits very late in the aftertaste.  You have to wait for it quite a bit and then it takes over... the chocolate and chalky malt up front is a tease and then the good stuff shows up.

T- Flavor is full of chipolte-as it is the highlight of this brew- behind this is mild to moderate smoke and roasted malt. The chipolte intensifies for the finish and lingers on and on for a long time with an ominous spicy heat.

M- Carbonation is high and tingly. Body is medium weight and chalky.

D- This is a great beer overall-if you like a spicy brew- if you dont you will hate this beer. Its not very complex overall but the smoke adds an interesting component to the spicy porter. The spiciness is big and the highlight. I like that the ABV is reasonable and it offers so much flavor.

Pours a nice deep chocolate brown that settles in black in the glass.  The head is tan, thick and enormous, refusing to go anywhere and leaves sheets of lacing.

The aroma is massively roasted with almost a burnt malt character.  Plenty of cocoa powder and only the faintest hint of chipotle pepper, though it does grow as it warms.

The taste is much like the aroma except for the finish.  The start is all about the black malts, heavily roasted, with chocolate and hints of espresso.  But the finish is where it gets interesting with the pepper flavors coming out and leaving a serious burn on the palate after each sip.

The mouthfeel is smooth and close to full bodied for a normal porter.  This thing almost has the feel of a Baltic porter, which is impressive given the ABV.

There is certainly no doubt that Mikkel knows his way around stouts and porters and this is one of the more interesting ones Ive had.  Its a big, robust porter with a big dose of peppers in the taste.  Certainly not the most drinkable porter, but very complex and tasty for a porter.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

543,"2010-11-17",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This inspired Chipotle Porter juxtaposes smoke and chocolate, roast and caramel to a rising chipotle pepper heat, itself tagging along a coniferous hop presence.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A lofty dark brown head sits atop the pure darkness, lacing a bit.
-The chipotle heat is harmonious with the smoked and chocolate malts.
-The hops also showcase citrusy angles.
-The frothy effervescence and rich body create a mighty comfortable mouthfeel.
-The only thing which would make this brew world-class to me would be a better levelled chipotle in the finish. As is, it soars past the hops and dark malts. A lot of people must love this feature though.

543,"2010-11-17",3.9,"On tap @ Mikkeller Bar, Copenhagen. Served neatly black, with a small caramel head. Had some expectations for this, so here we go: aroma is sweet chocolate, chili and coffee. Taste is surprisingly spicy; the chili is definitely up in your face along with dark chocolate, coffee and a surfacing layer of spiciness lurking in the wake of each sip. This is quite simply a kick ass chili flavored beer, one Clint Eastwood easily could have sipped alongside a bourbon in a dusty bar near the Mexican border. Despite the hot chili flavor this is a remarkable refreshing brew; each sip beckoning another. The chili factor in Texas Ranger is very high and not subtly integrated like other examples of the genre Ive come across, but it still manages to be convincing and affirmative enough to pull it off.

543,"2010-09-26",3.9,"750 ml bottle from West Lakeview Liquors (Chicago, IL). Pours a dark thicker roasty blackish opaque hue, dark brown edges, a huge frothy dark brown head sits atop, laces well and cakes and stays huge. Aromas are roasty coffee, barley, and dark chocolate with a touch of earthy heat, spiciness, more roast over the top. Some toffee and cocoa sweetness, but largely roasty and lightly warming spice. Initial is medium bodied, a big dose of roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate up front, dry and roasty, moving into a moderate warming peppery heat, earthy chipotle peppers grow in a wave of heat on the palate, warming as it goes down, decent sweetness pokes in, with great roastiness, coffee, dark chocolate, aand dry heat. Finish leaves heat, peppers, and roastiness of coffee, cocoa, and roasted barley. A touch of sweetness, but the peppers seem to take the cake. More spicy than anticipated, but in a good way, asserting itself and offering dry roast, coffee, dark and dry bitter chocolate as vegetal and earthy peppers stick on the backend and aftertaste. Sweetness stays at bay. Quite nice, from a pepper beer fan of course. Not necessarily a beer to drink in a session, but a special flavorful offering.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

543,"2010-09-23",3.7,"750ml, labeled as Mikkeller Chipotle Porter for the American market. Best by date 02/25/2013, consumed in September 2010.  The body is absolutely pitch black, shower far more dense and abyss-like than a sub 7% beer normally would.  A thick, puffy head of dark mocha-brown foam deflates like a soufflé, settling in as a thin but lasting, frothy blanket.  Torn and tattered tissue sheets of lacing mark the glass well.  Its really quite a beautiful looking beer.  The aroma is based in dark, bittersweet chocolate and darkly roasted caramel, with a touch of black strap molasses and a hint of sweet smoke.  Its not overtly peppery, but you do get some rustic, smoked jalapeno and adobo notes in the background.  Flavors are a good deal more intense in many respects.  First off, the chocolate element tells a tale of two extremes, showing bitter, dark notes and fluffy, espresso-laced cake notes simultaneously.  Burnt caramel sugars add further sweetness, as does a bit of creamy lactose.  Then theres the pepper, which is initially soft and smoky, quickly building to more of a zesty burn with a touch of acridity.  The palate is smooth and creamy up front, with plenty of body.  Growing carbonation works to intensify the chili burn on the back of the throat, as Belgian yeast leads towards a slightly drying finish.  This is a very interesting brew.  Well done, Id say, save for the fact that I cant really drink too much of it.  In small doses, I see some cool food pairings that could work here.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The aroma is sweet, a lot of chocolate, and just enough of pepper heat to be smokey. The taste is sweet, chocolate, smokey, and some bitterness. I cannot say I ""taste"" chipotle but I think it helps gives this beer its smokey quality. I know the lines get mixed between stout and porter but this is the most Imp.

543,"2010-08-12",4.2,"Courtesy of ericandersnavy. As Mikkeller Chipotle Porter. In a snifter. Pours black with a 3 finger dark tan lacey/clingy head. 3 fingers in a snifter? And 2 fingers of beer! I dont know what to say. My nose says food. Like Chipotle Tabasco. If you havent had that, get it . Full bodied with foamy carbonation. Flavor is chipotle tar. Or chipotle linoleum paste ( got to go back aways to get that one). I just whacked a hanbero sausage in the atomic atomizer, and I think it will go well with this. Its not chewy, but seems like it wants to be. Its hot. Not excessively so. But the heat does build a bit. So this is coffee/chipotle? Best I can do. Smooth. Burnt toast. But primarily chili.

Flavor follow suit with plenty of fudge, chocolate and espresso malt accompanied by tangy jalapeno-esque flavor, smoke, and a briny sort of spice.  Some leaves and dirt.  Finishes really spicy and hot from the peppers, but the flavor is phenomenal.  Dark chocolate mixes with smoked pepper astringency and heat and the mix is astounding.  Finally, the aftertaste exhibits dry toasty bittereness.  Medium-full bodied very creamy and fluffy mouthfeel.

The aftertaste is quite spectacular with notes of smoke, bitter dark chocolate and some chili. The chili is quite balanced and actually a ""natural"" part of the brew. One of the best chili brews ive had even if its a little too much of everything for being really drinkable.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hirigalzkar"

543,"2010-06-12",3.6,"Very stable, huge and very dark brown head over near black beer. Roasted coffee nose, dry hops and mole sauce, and very outspoken black cardemom peel aroma. Coffee, spiced, but the typical smoked chipotle flavour only comes out retronasal, together with a telltale heat in the throat. Well-bodied, very slick, fiery MF. Smokiness mounts all along. Certainly not bad - but... Doable as it might be on the chili matter, I had already problems finishing a glass; 75cl bottling is a silly idea, a real waste in this case.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Roasted malt, chocolate, mild smoke, Chipotle spiced pleasant finish.  The more smoked and costful version, Chipotle Ahumado, would in my opinion be even greater compared to a Chipotle Morita. Chipotle Ahumado would be ideal in an Imperial Stout! :-)","FAROE ISLANDS","faroeviking"

543,"2010-04-04",4.2,"Playing around with chilli is apparently very popular - A certain danish beer even won a title using that spicy stuff. Its not the first time Mikkeller have used chilli and the last time was pretty good bodes well for this next chilli-shot from Mikkeller. The bottle is  a thick and heavy 75cl bottle with some need lable work on. If a beer ever has been black this is the one. Hell is murky as MacBeth said. The head is triumphant huge and dark brown. This is a black beauty. The nose is roasty and your clearly sense the chili. It has a smokyness than reminds me of my favorite spice - bacon toped with burned malts. The taste is a three step thing. At first the sweetness from roastet malts along with som vanilla and licorice. The there is some hoppy bitterness at finally your are hit by a balanced afterburn from the chillis. You rarely see a beer with a balanced chili - but this one has succeed in blending the taste of chili in so it  adds to the picture instead of taking it all over. Nice. The palate is pretty thick and oily taking in mind that its a rather mild beer alcoholvice. Good job.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"
