A modern classic and a bit of a grower, even on the upper intermediate crafty palate: distills the spicy, herbal, nettle-y, wet polderland grasses of Hallertau and a contained dry Belgian saison-ish yeast into a tonic of a Belgian Bitter/Pale Ale. -  Alcohol is kept in check and put to work at the service of dryness and hop flavour. Crisp biscuit malts, opening up to minimal cereal sweetness to offset the lovely bitter bouquet of chthonic hop flowers that keeps on building and developing. - Would love to see more European craft brewers make more out of their terroir and whole cone hops instead of bidding high on travel-stressed US West Coast C-pellets. - Degustational tip to let the palate and taste buds slowly season to the XX and its saison infrastructure: start at moderate chill (7-8), sample at least half at cellar temperature (10-12).

997,"2015-01-25",4.1,"Pours a big, bubbly head with a bright yellow color.

Smells of wheat and soft yeast, with a coppery metallic hint on the back end. Underneath these dominant aromas, floral hops unfold, adding to the rustic character of this ale.

The taste yields much more hops than the nose did, while the brew begins with bready, mellow malts. Hops are detectable from the very beginning, side by side with the malts, while its floral character adds to the slightly biscuity malt foundation. This gets wrapped up by soft, slightly spiced belgian yeast, creating a great, smooth mouthfeel, which got a certain crispness to it. Then the hops turn remarkably dry, along with the sweeter malts, while they intensify their floral, wet grass appearance. 

Hops become the center of attention, while this still drinks like a belgian ale, due to its distinct yeast flavor, with some peppery spices towards the finish, introducing an almost herbal dryness to the tongue. Finishes hop-forward, while malts and yeast handle the bitterness well, providing a convincing sweet, mellow, spiced counterpart.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Taking by its name, a Bitter such perceptions do not fit the style, if this is her style. However, I believe this beautiful beer is pulling slightly to the Belgian lands.

The flavor is mild predominantly bitter with little malt of this feeling, which is roasted. The subtle bitterness is citrus, making it very pleasant. I could clearly notice slight sour notes with the presence of spices.

Its aftertaste is slightly sour, bitter, but very soft.

A beer with a velvety texture medium-low and medium body carbonation. With a high drinkability shown very light and refreshing. Honestly this is a beautiful beer distinctive style, befitting the great Belgian hopped.

 Served on tap in a 10 oz tulip

 Appearance  Served a lightly hazed yellow color straw color with a one finger white head. The head faded rather fast to give a nice level of lacing.

 Smell  A grassy and herbal hop aroma are the most potent. Mixed with these however is a nice sweet fruit aroma of some tropical fruit and some aromas of a spicy and yeasty nature.

 Taste  The flavor begins of a hoppy and malty flavor. The hop flavor is largely grassy and lemon hop. The maltiness remains constant throughout with the hop changing its profile some. While initially almost entirely of grassy and lemon flavors, soon some pine and grapefruit come to the tongue. At the end a light yeasty and somewhat spiced sweetness come to meet the hoppy flavors, rounding out the taste nicely.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side with a carbonation level that is just slightly above average. The higher carbonation is quite fitting and suits the blend of hop and Belgian flavors well.

 Overall  A tasty and easy drinking Belgian IPA. Nice hop flavor profile and a nice aroma; give it a go.","","Darkmagus82"

Body offers plenty, possibly not as expected; pale malt sweetness is abruptly assaulted by notes of dried herbs, peppery earthy spice, tobacco, hop resin, with mild undertones of light fruits. Dry finish, assertive bitterness cuts through hard with a minerally note lingering.

Tonnes of yeast & floral notes upfront, subtle hops as well & plenty of fruits coming through. Apples, some pear, lemon & orange all feature with plenty of pepper & spice backing them up. The smell wasnt the strongest initially but at the same time it wouldnt be considered weak either, the balance seemed good. I got some grain & a slight touch of alcohol with plenty of bitterness.

Slightly cloudy, bright amber to orange with a 1cm, foamy white head that holds well. Head retention is good with it reducing slightly to hold at just under half a cm & covers the surface of the beer, with plenty of bubbles rising to the top too.

Spicy with a very bitter taste that was only hinted at in the aroma, the taste goes well beyond that with some hops coming through too. The yeast from the nose featured strongly here as well with some pepper & a few fruits like apple & pears.

Smooth with solid, high carbonation & a medium body. The beer is a very dry & sharp tasting one with an intensely bitter finish.

I wasnt too sure about this one really, I quite enjoyed the aroma & how the taste started out but I wasnt a fan of the incredibly bitter finish to the beer.

Starts by gushing out of the bottle pristine white froth pouring into a tightly forming cloud of white purity settling about half a finger thick. 

The nose reeks of Belgium with funky herbaceousness that pervades every nook of your glass leaving only notes of oregano, mint and root cellars with dirt floors. Hat and assorted farm house smells circulate in the background, leafy green hops and general delights of the Belgian bitter style.

The palate is full green raw noble hops, chalk full of them with dry citrus rinds and ..chalk. So dry, Im figuratively patches after trying this, more hay seed and some new peach fruit, way before being ripe.

Pours a nice golden, just slightly copper.  1cm white Head is pretty active very briefly, settles quickly to a foamy cap layer with lacing.

Aroma is peppery and bready, hops. 

Mouthfeel is light.  Medium carbonation.

Taste is interesting.  A bitter beer with decent hopping.   Pretty much does what it says on the label.  The label says ""hoppiest beer in Belgium"".  not sure about that but it is hoppier than most Belgians I drink.   Interesting beer.

The aroma is full of Belgian spice, yeast, and funk. Some bready malt in the background.

A biscuity malt starts off, but the intensity is not high. Mild sweetness and brisk spice before the hops step in. Mild citrus flavor complements the strong bitter herbal hops. The end oscillates between bitter and a little sweet.

Crisp to start, but the carbonation breaks down after a little bit. Medium body. Finishes dry.

Clear bubbly and golden - almost seems to give off light it is so bright. 
The taste is not as bitter as I expected. Nothing to punch me in the mouth anyway. Definitely get that hop pop, but the grassy and citrus flavors really dont overpower this lovely drinkable ale. 
Its complex enough to be appreciated by beer lovers, but approachable enough to be an introductory beer for your new-to-real-beer friends and relatives. The finish is crispier than most goldens, but not so much as to make you make clicking sounds with your mouth after drinking.

997,"2011-02-22",3.9,"""The hoppiest beer of Belgium"". I cant make out the best by date but the bottle says it is good for 5 years, Im sure it is best fresh though.

It pours into my tulip a murky gold/orange with a huge 4 finger white head.

There is a definite pungent hoppiness to it that just attacks the nostrils. I like it alot, the hops are citrusy and floral with a bit of spice, decidedly noble.

The taste is more balanced than the smell, with a big hop bitterness in the end but smooth malty flavors such as candi sugar and caramel as well. Perhaps a bit of raisin too. The hops are bitter and grassy, very nice.

It may be the hoppiest, but it isnt the best Belgian IPA though it is solid.

997,"2010-11-26",4.0,"Bottle.  Poured a lightly hazy, bright yellow color with a dense, inch and a half thick white head that slowly receded and left some thick webs of lacing.  Dry, earthy hop aroma with hints of dried, dusty fruits including orange, light lemon, and soft tangerine as well as some light hints of spiciness.  Lightly sweet, crisp entry leads into a dusty fruitiness with hints of orange flesh and tangerine that transition into a moderately dry, earthy hoppiness with hints of dry orange and a lightly doughy yeastiness that lingers softly into the lightly bitter finish.  Moderate carbonation paired with the bitterness creates a soft, delicate mouth feel.  Overall, a great example of a traditional Belgian ale that just kicks ass to drink.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"

Aroma is clean sweet malt with grassy hops suggesting dry-hopping and fruitiness that might originate from yeast-derived esters or hops. The simplistic flavor is predominantly resinous & piney with high bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Light-medium bodied with moderately high carbonation creating peppery-prickly sensation and palate-cleansing dry finish enhanced by intense bitterness.

997,"2010-09-02",4.3,"Serving: 750 ml. bottle from State Line Liquors. 
Aroma: There is a nice up front hopiness that is paired with almost Saison like notes.  Grass, a bit of hay, light yeast, and lemongrass notes were present. 
Appearance: It pours a hazy gold with a pillowy white head.  Nice head retention and spotty lacing left behind. 
Taste: Hop forward for a Belgian ale, but not so much compared to most IPAs these days.  Still, it seems a nice hopped up version of a Saison.  There are grassy and citric hops combined with bit of lemon, Belgian yeast, and a mild pale malt sweetness.  
Palate: Light to medium body with an above average quantity of soft carbonation leading to a slightly bitter finish.

997,"2010-04-15",3.7,"330. Thanks, Dany! Really surprised I havent rated this one before, but, evidently, its not available in Seattle. Maybe I have been seeing it in Portland. In any case, its high time to get to it, and a great beer to find on the porch. Pours a cloudy toffeeish medium gold with a frothy, fizzy white head and intermittent spotty lacing. Nice floral nose with plenty of spicy yeast notes, with a little bit of tangerine like hop in it. Not really getting any brett but Ill live and the beers fine either way. Creamy, somewhat fizzy medium body. Tangy toffeeish malt on the mid palate, some herbal hop on the peppery side, and then a nice blend of mineral dryness and a bit of resiny bitterness at the finish. Beautifully done, worth several more bottles drinking invested.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

997,"2010-03-15",3.9,"Appearance: Deep, peach golden color with bubbly, carbonated appearance and medium-sized, fluffy white head sits on the top.

Flavor: Intense hoppy dryness with coriander-like phenolic yeast notes. Not as fruity/resinious kind of hops in there like in the american style IPAs. I can even get some fresh celery/asparagus notes at the medium. Typical continental, leaf-hoppy dryness leads the flavor. The lingering effect is quite intense but not harsh.

Mouthfeel/Palate: Lively carbonation without the harsh Co2 effect. Smooth, slipping yeasty enviroment. Easy to Medium body.

A - Cloudy, hazy golden. Large, foamy white head with a good amount of lacing left over.

S - Lots of hop flavors including some lemon and orange citrus, pine, grassy, and floral.

T - Very hoppy beer with taste similar to the smell. Grassy and citrus and some pine being the most apparent. Minimal malt taste. Some medicinal taste as well. A bit of tart/funky yeast flavors.

M - Fairly light bordering medium body. Normal carbonation, and somewhat creamy. Drying effect at the end.

D - Not great. Due to the bitterness and drying effect it is not all that refreshing. Not bad flavors though, and I wouldnt mind drinking again. Just probably one would do me for a night.

Revisit 12/21/2013, 11 oz bottle from Bottleworks. Really appealing nose of (ironic, given the above) Belgian yeast bubblegum, lemon, and lots of dusty farmyard. On the first sip the beer is shockingly bitter given the aroma, to the extent of seeming more like a gimmick than a natural blending of styles. White grapefruit pith, Hallertau hops. It starts to get a bit better as the palate acclimates. Gosh, Id go about 8/4/7/4/15=3.8 on this today. Ill average the two ratings.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Poured out a huge white cap that leaves excellent thick sticky lacing and has great retention. The beer looked lilke it might have a bit of haze in it but doesnt. Lots of effervecence and appears straw / gold in colour - that was until I dumped all the sludge from the bottle into my glass - now it is more like weak metamucil. The aroma is odd - musty fruit, strong dusty wheat, yeast, floral, a bit of spice and at has the smell of orange juice gone bad (thanks Aracauna, that is dead on). That smell does fade in strength during the warming process. Taste is suprisingly mellow when you get past the large ammount of hops with notes of apricots (weak) and pepper . However, even with the heavy bitter flavour it still seems sort of flat or watery....interesting. The mouthfeel is also very good with lots of soft carbonation and a notable malty middle with the hop hammer at the end giving a very long finish. Im not sure why I enjoyed this much more this time around but I will get more for the odd casual drink and cellaring. A 3.9 on my own personal rate scale is very debatable.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Palate is tart and clean, with more citrus, lemon drop candies, bubblegum, and spicy hop character rather than bitter, though there certainly is bitterness.

This beer most likely has the highest IBUs that Ive encountered in a Belgian ale before. The bitterness rolls across the tongue and lingers in the finish.

Aroma is nice, very floral with just the mildest barnyard funky notes and some nice herbal hops. The flavor does not pack the punch that I had expected or at least not in the way that I had expected it to. XX bitter is a good way to describe this beer because it is very bitter, it is almost an herbal bitterness Im not sure which hops are used here but I would wager that they are English, this type of bitterness is not one I find in Czech, German, or American hoppy beers. This isnt really as fruity as Orval but it certainly has a bit of orange peel and apple fruitiness, but these are fairly subdued. The flavor is all together very dry and the funkiness is fairly prevalent which mixes very well with the bitterness making this a pleasure to drink.

The smell starts with the lemon and floral hops but is fairly sweet with Belgian yeast and some sugar in the background. There are definitely some spices tickling the noses as well. The taste is less sweet than the aroma and brings more bitterness to the table.

997,"2008-10-29",4.1,"From a 750mL Bottle, Expiration Date 2/2013.  Hazy, straw gold colored pour with a thick head of fine bubbled, brilliant white meringue.  Strong herbal hop aromas with a backing of crackery malt.  Notes of dandelions and arugala; this would pair wonderfully with a fresh, tart goat cheese.  Soft, perfumey yeast esters with just a hint of dustiness.  Pithy lemon rind.  Light bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel with a cleansing dryness, yet soft texture.  Crackery pilsner malt flavors up front followed by a wave of herbal hop bitterness.  Bold and assertive, but hop characters are exceptionally clean.  Hoppy enough to borderline on pine flavors in the finish, but all the while distinctly noble.  Toward the finish, a mild brett presence provides a light dustiness, further enhancing the bitterness.  Bold, interesting, complex beer that also doubles as a refreshing summer drinker.  Certainly pilsner-esque, although to state the obvious, much hoppier.  On that note, I’d love a touch more pils malt character, but this would mean simply dialing back the hops a bit and thereby ruining the point of this beer.  That being said, the yeast characters really do more to enhance the bitterness of the beer than anything else, so in that sense, the concept is flawless.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

997,"2008-10-14",3.9,"Draft at Brick Store Pub. Pours a cloudy light gold/yellow with a medium-sized white head that is persistent and leaves lace on the glass. The aroma is grassy from hops with some subtle yeast and bread character. The aroma belies what comes next: a crazy bitter hop-bomb. The flavor starts bready and a crackery and then the grassy hops begin to grow. By mid-palate, the tongue is assaulted by a huge tidal wave of the green cones. Amazing and unexpected. The hops are definitely grassy and earthy with a dusty character to the malt in the middle (must be the brett that the description mentions?). The finish is dry and funky - but mostly hoppy and bitter. Despite the big surprise of hop bitterness, it only takes the palate a few sips to acclimate to the hoppiness. After that, it really doesn’t taste so bitter - but dry and quaffable. The mouthfeel is medium in body and in carbonation. Overall, an impressive ale - a total delight.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

The aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, biscuits), moderately to heavily hoppy (flowers, herbs, grass, lemon), lightly to moderately yeasty (barnyard, basement), with notes of pepper, hint of exotic fruits, orange and straw, hints of exotic fruits and tangerine. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texturte, lively carbonation, dry and very long finish with heavy bitterness. Simply an amazing beer. An oustanding mix of drinkability, balance complexity and above all cleanliness. Truly a forerunner of the Belgian bitter/IPAs trend.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

Flavour is very hoppy and bitter, grassy, with a killer balance of fruit, spice and whatever magic  they have weaved into this. Fabulous long dry bitter finish.  Perfectly balanced.

XX is full bodied and creamy with an edge of bright carbonation, rather dry, and flavored with enough putty-like yeast to plug a faucet leak. famously bitter for a belgian, the carbonation is the tooth and the hops are the nails, but the kind of raking they give the tongue is more like a massage, calming, delicious and salubrious. thanks to jeff (TAR) and cathy for this dreamy hour of drinking pleasure.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Overall,  not that bad  actually very enjoyable, the yeast strain they use is real workhorse of the brew, anything less this beer might be rather bad.","http://westchesterbeer.com, USA","DeadGuyFrank"

XX Bitter pours a deep hazy golden. The gold absolutely glows in the light becoming more of a straw golden. Massive amounts of tiny carbonation bubbles rise to the surface creating a big three finger dense white creamy head and keeping it there for ages. As the head ever so slowly recedes I get sheet lacing so thick its impossible to see through it. This is one amazing looking brew.

Aroma is big and juicy. Candi sugar and biscuity malts greet the nose up front. Grassy hops come along rather quickly and floral hop aromas show up on the finish. Dusty yeast is splashed around throughout always in the background but always there. Strong wafts of gritty pear and granny smith apple rise into the air as well. An excellent smelling ale.

Flavor is right on par with the aroma. Biscuity malts create a solid background with a sprinkling of candi sugar sweetness. The dusty yeast shows up mid palate along with pear skins and granny smith apples. For being an older bottle the hops are still very apparant showing up on the finish with a very welcomed grassy, spicy nature. Excellent!

The mouthfeel is absolutely alive. High natural carbonation tickles the tongue and gets it ready for the hoppy finish. Light body from the use of candi sugar. The swallow is dry and leaves you wanting another drink immediately.

The drinkability is off the charts. This glass I poured myself is disappearing far too quickly. I find myself wanting to gulp it down.

XX Bitter, in my opinion, is one outstanding ale. Absolutely delicious with a nice hop bitterness on the finish. I feel like running to the store and picking up more of these right now. Two thumbs up. Im anxious to try others from De Ranke.

997,"2007-05-12",4.3,"Cloudy deep golden pour with spritzy carbonation. A lofty, rocky, popping white head forms, enduring throughout the quaff. Lacing is everywhere, like the head exploded, like its glued to the inside of the glass. Aroma seems like stumbling into a secret library, with dust-plastered books, antique furniture and a stoic staircase that the aroma winds up and down. Notes of yeast are musty and ancient. Hops are generous in quantity and zest, alive with scents of oranges fallen from the shady grove trees, clouds of lemon merengue and unkempt beds of daisies and daffodils. Also noted is a farmhouse funk character that seems to bridge the gap between the tart yeast, spice from hops and fruit and floral dashes. Tremendous up to this point. It gets even more exciting upon first satisfying sip. The hops are now predominately grassy in nature, the musty yeast provides the musty citrus twang. Funk notes arrive late, along with medium high bitterness and light sweet notes. Spicing is moderate, alcohol only slightly noticeable. Such a unique beer. The finish is dry and hoppy, then funky, with great length and thirst quenching power. Mouthfeel is very lively but has substantial body, with mild acidity and near-perfect carbonation levels - just enough to make it animated without compromising delicate nuances. A benchmark for a still rarely encountered style. Older samples have showcased a remarkable retention of the hop profile and a mild but more expansive brettanomyces and farmhouse character.

997,"2007-04-18",3.7,"Cloudy pale straw yellow with a massive bubbly head that demonstrates excellent retention and lacing. Immediately after pouring the aroma was predominantly of sweet pears and bready yeast, but as the head settled a bit the piney hop aroma became dominant. Semi-sweet, lightly yeasty, very grassy and overwhelmingly bitter-- so bitter that there is an ominous ammonia edge to the palate that would be very unpleasant if it were stronger, however this beer manages to remain well-balanced and interesting without being harsh.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

Appearance:  Medium golden in color and slightly hazed.  White head was full and frothy with good retention.  Nice lacing.  Flavor:  A brief taste of bready malt before the hops kick in.  Pine and slightly resinous hops with some grass and earth notes.  Some musty/dusty funk in the middle with a bit of lemon into the finish.  Assertive bitterness that comes early and stays long.  Palate:  Medium bodied.  Medium-high carbonation.  Overall:  A good beer, but not something Id drink every day.  Bitterness was a bit harsh at times.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","RagallachMC"

Refreshing, but with a certain earthy muskiness in the background. Lacks the complexity and depth of Orval (even though De Ranke markets this beer as Orval with everything turned up to 11). Somewhat simple, yet well balanced. The taste was bitter indeed, it lives up to its name. Strong hops & nice (yet subdued) bretty tartness. Typical bready Belgium-yeast in the background, which matches nicely with the dry-hopped taste. Medium/light mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Nice beer, not as mouth-scorchingly hoppy as some of the more full-on IIPAs but it still delivers plenty in the hop-department.

Some citrus, flowers, spices, and some vague woody smokiness.  Very astringent, bitter finish.  Definitely a refreshing change from the typical ultra-sugary Belgian beers.

997,"2007-01-14",3.9,"750ml bottle, and the best before date is not notched out. Oh well.

Pours a slightly hazy pale, straw-like color with a good two fingers worth of foam that fades slowly to a solid cap. The lacing is broken and in quite large chunks.

Smell; very earthy hops in this one, with some vague hints of citrus. Theres a touch of pepper in here as well.

Taste; as with the nose, the hops have a very earthy feel to them, but the citrus is a little bit more pronounced, and comes off lemony. A bit of caramel malts are present to go along with the peppery spices. Initially the hops and crbonation came off as a bit harsh But as this gets warmer, the hops become more floral, and the carbonation smooths out a lot.

Mouthfee/Drinkabiity; as I said above, at first this was a bit harsh with the carbonation, but that settled down to become pretty smooth, with medium body. The drinkability ends up pretty very good on this one.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

Finally! On to the beer! The aroma is hoppy, and also a bit pungeant - almost but not quite like a sour lambic.

The flavor - a Belgian with hops. Lots of hops. A surprising amount of hops (for a Belgian). A prominent noble hop spice up front almost hides a light malt presence.

In long: Great start.  Aroma of holding a flowers bouquet in one hand and a pineapple in the other hand while standing in a dry non-coniferous forest.  The body is very yeasty and even a bit wild.  Some salty notes and although very much belgian this beer feels as crisp as a pilsner.  The fruity character is interesting and I would describe it as citrus fruits peels, pineapples, lemony meringue and even some dried bananas.  The hops are dry and floral with an assertive flower petals flavour.  The finish is dry and salty with a short bitterness of medium-strong intensity.  Fantastic brew.

But having had several more bottles of this since my first taste of XX, my opinion of this beer gets higher every time I try it. One particularly nice bottle at Dickies Grillhouse in Brugge sticks in my memory. So much lovely herbal minty hop character. A modern classic.

(Previous Rating: Bottle. Cloudy straw yellow with an abundance of long lasting white head. Soft, minty-clean hop aroma. Toothpaste. Light body, firm carbonation. Brisk clean bitterness, pepper, lemon, rather dry and short flavor profile. Becomes a little chewy. An unusual beer. On it’s own, it struck me as kind of off balance.

I think when I see that something is ""the most of such and such"", I get nervous that it might be a marketing ploy. I was pleasantly surprised, however.

997,"2006-01-25",4.7,"De Ranke XX Bitter is billed as ""The Hoppiest
Beer of Belgium"" and after one 750ml bottle, I must
concur. Ive never come across a beer from Belgium
that I could say was hoppier. This beer is a Belgian
Golden Ale, coming in at 6.2% abv, and is hopped with
massive amounts of Brewers Gold and Hallertau hop
varieties. My guess is, this beer is well over 100
IBU(bitterness units) and its percieved bitterness is
off the charts. This beer is so bitter, it almost
tastes like poision, but in a good way if you can
believe that. 

De Ranke XX Bitter bottles are wrapped in paper, and
what a gift a hop head recieves, after un-wrapping and
popping the corked bottle. De Ranke XX Bitter pours to
a beautiful, hazy, very pale golden color with a
thick, creamy, dense, bright white head, and a lively
carbonation. This beer is sedimented with yeast, so a
secondary fermentation is taking place in the bottle,
also producing lots of natural carbonation. The nose
on this beer is a virtual hop assault of your
nostrils. Massive waves of very flowery, herbal, and
citric hop aromas flood the nostrils, with just a hint
of yeastiness and pale malt fighting for your
attention as well. You could hold this beer a foot
away, and you could still literally, smell the hop
aromas, they are that intense. The palate is firm with
good pale malt flavors, a backdrop of yeasty flavor,
and lots of herbal and lemon peel hop flavors on the
tongue. De Ranke XX Bitter finishes with a extreme,
intense, brutal, flowery, citric, and herbal hop
bitterness that lingers and will make your face wince
it is so bitter. 

I image this is what hemlock tastes like going down.
Clearly this beer is not for everyone, and is geared
for beer lovers who love extreme tastes. Most beer
drinkers would not enjoy this beer. This beer is
brewed for the hard core beer lover, and will even
give the most seasoned hop head pause. If you love
bitter beers, this is one, that just has to be
experienced. I loved this beer the second I tried it.
And for a beer that is so unique and brewed in such
small batches, it is very well priced. I only paid $9
for a 750ml bottle, and it was well worth it for me.  De Ranke XX
Bitter can be found in select markets in the US, and
is a beer well worth seeking out. This is the
ultimate aperitif beer, and would slice right though
the richest of dishes, such dense and buttery cheeses,
prime rib au jus, a nutty terrine, or lamb shanks.
This one floored me.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

997,"2005-11-16",4.0,"750ml bottle, Apr. 2004 vintage.  Appealing and strong spicy, floral hop aroma, touches of lemon and pine here and there with some lightly farmy touches, fruity tartness, doughy yeast and crackery malts, the vaguest hint of sweetness detected beneath it all.  Partially opaque light golden color with a sticky, massively foamy head that thankfully settled to a manageable level but not without leaving clouds of lace behind.  Flavor profile is initially lightly sweet and flowery, becoming more citric and quite hoppy and featuring a wonderfully integrated finish with elements of pepper, sharp, freshly-cut wood and musty leather to accompany the considerable and long-lingering bitterness.  Lively, gently acidic and bracing mouthfeel coupled with a medium body.  Certainly is the hoppiest Belgian beer I believe Ive yet sampled.

Aroma is pleasantly strong with a hoppy play between a nice dry and pale floral peak capped with a slight spice and citric edge. Dry bready yeast tones intertwine within as it warms; very nice aroma with this one.

Flavors dont elude to the namesake ""XX Bitter"" as much as I was hoping but it does carry a wonderful display of hop senses that are completely carried over from the aroma. Front is quick with a slight sweet malt and breadyness, which quickly turns dry in the bread tone, slight earthy, spicy, drying slips right in over the palate with a very nice hop profile which includes the floralness with a pale dried hop cone sense and light nuances of citric leftovers and one pale effect of bitterness thats quite clean and lingers some into the finish where more bready dryness sticks around.

Feel is quick and clean with an overall clean and favorable dry medium body thats got a nice fluffy carbonation thats fulfillingly smooth and bready. Quite drinkable in that regards. Slides right down with ease and carries a nice finish of hop character and flavors the whole ride through without alot of hankering bitterness.

Let’s take note that this bottle is a year and a few months past 1 yr old, so the bitterness level must not be what it used to be. First sniff indicated very yeasty aspects that remind me of a cement-floored basement with a bit too high of a humidity level, a fair bit too many cobwebs hanging on the ceiling and just too much dust on the books that decorate the walls. Nevertheless, the hops are strong although not as agressive as I thought, reading the labels, I see they’ve used hallertau which I love. It’s very floral, lemony, slightly resiny, lightly orangey. In mouth, the musty yeast and noble hops work very well together. It’s extremely refreshing, salty with a moderate bitter attack that finishes spicy. Silky medium body, mostly small bubbled carbonation feels a bit low.

997,"2004-03-17",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 16, 2004 Sampled May 2004, from 33cl bottle  Pours a hazy straw gold color, and is topped by a cream colored head of reasonable size.  It is pretty well carbonated.  Smells of earthy grassy hops with a slight lemoniness here.  The taste is sharp and bitter with a  light palate and a lemony finish.  This beer is definitely bitter as advertised.  This is pretty tasty, and is in much better condition than when I last sampled it.  There is some earthy, hay character in the taste.  This is perhaps a bit too bitter as it seems to hide the underlying complexity that this beer has.  Sampled March, 2004 from 750ml bottlePours with a lusty creamy off white head that sits atop a hazy gold beer.  The aroma is of grassy hops, with perhaps a bit of light struck character.  Some grain character is in the aroma as well as soft notes of honey and hay. The taste has a nice sharp bitterness to it that fades into a bit of medicinal hoppiness.  The grassy hop character is here in the flavor.  The beer is pretty dry with not much in the way of malt character, perhaps a hint of toasted biscuit flavors.  Overall I am a bit disappointed in this beer, I hope that this is just not as fresh as it should be.  I will definitely get a draft pint from the Hop Leaf the next time I am there.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

An odd beer, to be sure but not one without certain eccentricities. Finish had a lighter than expected bitterness along with a taste of hay or straw. Decent beer and worth trying.

997,"2003-11-02",3.2,"Good, wet head that fades to a fuzzy film on top of the cloudy orange body. The aroma strikes me first with something that I really don't like. My best way to describe it is orange-juice gone bad. Otherwise it's flowery and herbally. The flavor is even more herbally, which melds nicely with the hop bitterness. There's a bit of odd flavor here. It's like the difference between fresh orange juice and the orange juice stored in clear glass bottles. It's not rotten, but something light does to orange juice, make it have a similar bitter fruit flavor to what this beer has going on. Turpentine or creosote. Definite bandaids. It's got a lot going on, but there's too many things that I don't like about it.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
997,"2003-10-30",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2006 33 cL bottle, 01/2011bbe, Bordeaux glass.  A deep golden body with an orange-tinted heart is capped by a mountainously frothy white head that is slow to recede and leaves elegant sheet lacing.  Pungent, raw hops are first to assault the nose rich and diverse with grassy, floral and lightly peppery aspects.  Lightly funky barnyard aromas arent quite up there with Orval, but they do blend quite well with the intense hops.  Sweet honey and bread malt elements provide a great backbone with perhaps a detectibly sour Munich malt contribution.  Some fruits--pears, white grapes--show on occasion, but the other aromas are too powerful for those esters to arrive in full.  Sourdough bread and honey tastes start at first sip and carry on through the long finish, providing a solid backbone to everything else.  A light fruity acidity starts up front and a soft funk takes shape around mid-palate.  By the finish the realization of brett has fully set in and the pungency of the hops takes hold.  Theyre fresh, and decently bitter, but the malt base has so much traction in this beer that the hops never quite break loose to scream on their own.  The finish is long and significantly dry, but it holds on to a sweet honey taste that makes it seem a little sweet than it really is.  Very silky texture and somewhat reserved carbonation for a Belgian Ale lends fatness to the experience.  Really good stuff, not quite mind-bending though.  I like the hops used, theres just not enough of them early in the boil and the brett hasnt fully set in this batch (I assume).  Delightful malts, though.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

4/10/2002. On tap at the Toronado (SF). Sour bitter astringent, headless, light aroma, pale golden, slightly tannic. Is this growing on me?

997,"2002-11-02",3.3,"My second quinine-beer this week.  Strong Campari-like taste, with tons of botanicals/herbs and, of course, lots of bitterness (hey, the name shouldve warned you).  For the saison style, this is far more bitter than any other.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
997,"2002-10-30",3.3,"Hops, and malt with a whiskeyish character greet the nose -  Some sourness and some caramel. Sedimented golden beer w. a small creamy head. The flavor is sweet, but with a hops burst, citric and astringent, worthy of a Northwest microbrew APA. There is some malt, raisins, a woody dry texture, a definite Belgian feel to this beer but ultimately, the APA-like hoppiness defines. The aromatics of the hops used pale (no pun intended), next to Cascades et al, but actually thats to my liking, since American hophead beers escape me. Finish is tart, bitter as intended, and not at all bad.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"

997,"2002-08-17",3.8,"Best by 10/04, so apparently bottled 10/99. Big head, very cloudy orange color reminiscent of Orval, hoppy nose with a sour note. Somewhat dry, citrusy, herbal, earthy, with fresh-cut grass and hoppy bitterness. I was hoping for something yeastier, but this will do. ""The Hoppiest Beer of Belgium""? Perhaps.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"

This is the second time ive had it and it impresses me just as much as the first time i had it. Very large white frothy head, hazy hay colour. Very dry floral hop aroma, also a bit peppery and earthy. Very dry hoppy and bitter, spicy, slightly fruity (citrus) flavour aswell. Nice, long bitter finish.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
997,"2002-07-06",3.9,"Pours a very cloudy orange, generous creamy white head and sheets of lace that last to the bottom of the glass. Nose is wineish, sour, citrus tones and hints of hops. Front is sweet, the top light and the hops hit early and hard, the finish is very dry, acidic, and the long lasting hop bitter aftertaste makes this beer for me.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
997,"2002-06-20",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2003   Probably the fluffiest head on a beer that I have ever seen. Spicy citrus/lemon malt followed by a blast of hops. Perfectly smooth. A great beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
997,"2002-06-20",3.9,"Pale gold with an ENORMOUS head. Had off of DRAFT at Le Bier Circus. Smooth crips body. Huge floral hopnose. Flavor is reminiscent of a very smooth IPA (Bells Two-Hearted?). Quite nice.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
997,"2002-06-16",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2015 Jan 2015 750ml bottle. Head is initially large, frothy, rocky, white, fully lasting. Body is hazy medium yellow, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, cracker), moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), lightly to moderately yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of lemon zest, pepper, gum, SweetTarts, dried pineapple, pencil shavings. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

About as close to perfect as beer can get.  Might be the freshest Ive ever sampled this beer, only five months from bottling (of course I had to order it from Belgium to get it younger than a year old), and wow is it lively!  Beautiful complex nose, beautiful big lasting head with that luscious ""alive"" yeast haze, and THE perfect flavor balance for my tastes (I recently had a nearly equally fresh XXX Bitter, and as great as that is, this is easily my fave of the two).  Insanely clean all around. It would be hard to pick between this and a stellar vintage of Saison Dupont for overall favorite beer, i.e. an ideal ""stranded on a desert island"" beer.  One of the top ten, and maybe even top five, beers in the entire world.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
997,"2002-06-16",4.1,"Almost clear(until the yeast pour), golden with a killer head and lace. The nose is one of the most unique I have encountered. I pick up malt(bready and grainy)lemon,hops, perfume, yeast and others. Medium bodied, almost creamy, first thing that hits me is lemon and then a very well defined light malt. Citrusy/bitter hops bomabard your mouth, not overly so mind you but enough to make it addictive and a very eccentric brew. One i will surely try again.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
997,"2002-04-09",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2003 Oh, heavens to Betsy!  The aroma is incredible; boasting fresh lemon rind, spicy hops, and barnyard; all of which previous users have mentioned.  Pours to a cloudy straw yellow, which reminds me of Prima Pils, almost green, due to being so heavily hopped.  Head provides serious stickiness and creaminess.  Flavors are wonderfully fresh, mustiness, barnyard characteristics, hay?, extreme bitterness, some spice that lingers in the dry, herbal finish.  This is a suped up super duper pilsner, if you ask me. Go ahead and pour in the yeast, i promise you will not regret it.  I have always passed this beer up thinking 'belgian bitter?', what do they know about bitter?  Indeed I was mistaken.  All hop heads MUST seek this one out.  I am going back to St. Louis for more.  It is $8.59 a pop, but well worth it.  Addictive.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
997,"2002-03-25",4.4,"Vanilla yellow hue with an oaky musty aroma. Rather hoppy beer that stays rather consistent throughout. Citrusy taste.","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"

997,"2001-10-23",2.4,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2007 Bottled, blind tasting session, June 07, 2.4: Very dusty aroma with malts, grain and citrus. Yellow color, cloudy, white head, fair lace. Light sweet, light sour, rather bitter, astringent, pepper, some citrus and this everlasting bitterness. In my opinion out of balance as a whole. Bottled, Oct 01, 2.7: This is indeed unlike the Belgian beer brewed by the Belgian micros. And normally I like them, but this is too bitter for me.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
