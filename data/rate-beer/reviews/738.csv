738,"2017-05-20",3.9,"Kopergeel, iets wazig, crèmekleurige foamy schuimkraag, weinig koolzuur.

First I have to start off by saying I sincerely and thoroughly respect Jopen, and admire what, for want of a better word, a commercial brewery can do in the craftbeer revolution, and all this time keeping this level of quality, inspiration and innovation, infact THESE GUYS ONLY GET BETTER! Ofcourse Welde has its reputation too!
The aroma starts off with a very hoppy kind of funky bitterness, and when youve got your breath back from that beauty, this has breathed a bit, and oh what joy! That beautiful sweetness of rye, layered with fruit, grass, doughy, ashy even, funky leather whiffs, dark malt sweetness, raisins, citrus fruit, too much almost too describe...
My word, now I still got to get to the taste... Well, everything above, with addition of mango, pear, yeasty ánd hoppy dryness, fruity bitter, extremely fine mouthfeel, absolutely perfect carbo, tentalisingly fine bubbles, elegant bitter fruit aftertaste, hop dryness there, but as I said, elegant, I really wonder why they state its got the drinkability of, for ryes sake, a bloody lager! ( yes, in the face of this gorgeous Beer, I dont mind being denigrating about lager, knowing that lager wont stand the comparison, not even in the drinkability section, for although there are a handfull of good lagers in this world that can even make you happy next to being a simple thirstquencher, this goes way beyond that, this is elegant beauty that makes you crave, till youre on your knees begging for more, it replaces your thirst with satisfaction, a sensious sensation of experiencing craftmanship, quality, beauty....
Ehhh.... Is it obvious I like this beer? Well, I do!
And for the umpthiest time, Jopen got me hooked...","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","Craftmember"
