On a night when the tap list seemed endless this marked the final pour before it was time to head out. It was almost like being back in Belgium save for the scenery. If you get a chance to try anything like this donÂ’t even bother looking at the price tag; just go for it. I wish IÂ’d ordered a second pour.

Aroma / Appearance - The flat brownish body swirls gracefully around the glass. The dry musty feel of old books and funky old cheese set the tone. This might not be the sharpest or most memorable lambic yet it still deserves reflection.

Flavor / Palate - A dry musty taste sticks to the tongue and throat. Old newspapers, antique store air, and aged citrus crawl into every crevice. The laid back profile shows signs of having mellowed. If not for the vinegary finish this might be one of those accessible lambics that you share with people who are just exploring the boundaries of what beer can be.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
