Batch 1 bottle. poured a slight murky golden to a light orange colour with a white head on top of the glass. aroma is sour tart funk, fresh apricots, tart vineous notes, oak, tannis, taste is sweet juicy apricot upfront, but the sour notes kicked right in after that. its so sour, its just burning down your throat. (the Batch 2 bottle is not as sour as this B1) white wine is starting to dominate after it opens. sourness aftertaste is pretty sharp, overall the fresh apricot balance is quite impressive. however i prefer the regular saison du fermier over this one.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"

3134,"2015-11-22",4.1,"750ml bottle acquired via an In Person trade via Chicago FB Groups. Thanks, bro. Pours a well hazed peachy golden amber hue. A touch darker into the middle with lively orange glow emanating onto the edges and bottom. Well hazed with a bubbly whitish head atop. A decent layer dies to a bubbly ringer, ok lacing overall. Aromas present tart apricots and punchy lactic lemony life, french oak and wet wood meet some wild funky yeast, white grape and some tannic wine barrels. Funky, a touch spicy with some nice firmer yeastiness at times. Big white wine and sour apricot appeal really sets the tone on the nose with firm sourness, a touch of bready malt and subtle honeycrisp sweetness behind. Initial is punchy and sour, a firm apricot backing and punchy lemony citric and lactic acidity hits the palate. Dry and tannic wine barrel, oak meet some subtle vanilla, a potent acidity that coats the palate into the backend. Big flavors and feels but a lighter body and never acedic, this one makes an impression. Tart green grapes, lemon and sour apricots. Dry, a bit slick and oaky as we push into the backend. A gentle yeastiness, subtle lingering fruit and subtle malty appeal into that backend lingers on. Still those potent sour and fruity elements are the leaders. Apricot, citrus, white wine and sour grapes. A subtle crab apple, mellow funk. Really an impressive flavor and sourness at times without any acedic issues. A touch fuzzy, yogurty and dry. Fun stuff. Really good nose leads into a punchy front end and flavorful appeal throughout. Perhaps a bit tannic and wine driven as we finish but overall, I think this one is quite memorable if a bit harsher on the finish and lingering afterwards. While the flavors are impressive, they seem to cover up some of the complexity overall. Still, a tasty offering with a potent sourness, good fruit liveliness, lactic appeal and nice white wine type elements. Its very much up my alley and something I hope to revisit again. Great dang stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Hazy orange body. Medium white head.

3134,"2015-11-02",4.2,"Blend #2 bottle at SPC, 10/29/15.Well, it sucks that you can only get a 750mL of this to drink on premise, but I didnt come all the way here to not try this beer, so looks like Ive got a whole bottle to myself. Oh woe is me....Careful pour shows a bright apricot colored liquid that is sparklingly carbonated creating an off-white head that is well-retained. Good clarity to the liquid, leaving the sediment behind.Damn, that is a fine, fine aroma that would turn a smile on the face of the best fruit lambic producers....Its both funky, with nicely understated sulphur notes painting a very barnyard-esque picture, and polished, with reserved but ample oak character, homogenous acids and clear, bright, wonderfully authentic apricot notes. Id be hard pressed to believe that this would score less than Fou Foune in a blind test, at least based on the aroma. No alcohol or flaw in the nose. Magnificent.Oak and apricot at once square off in the flavor but before either can emerge dominant, a strong malt presence, both supple and sweet, arrives. Very rich honey notes balance poignant acids both from fruit and bacteria. Plentiful apricot flavor is garnered from start to finish and light oak dryness, coupled with soft funk and more gentle lactic acids sit on the end.Tight carbonation and a supple maltiness make for a wonderfully soft, lightly spritzy mouthfeel right up there with the best lambics. The only thing I found at fault here was just a bit too much strength. Its reflected in the above average sweetness and overall rich maltiness. It certainly never gets messy or boozy, but at the same time, the 8% is definitely felt. Even shaving off 1% abv here would work wonders, I think, but as is, this is still one hell of a beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
