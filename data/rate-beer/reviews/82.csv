82,"2016-10-07",3.7,"12oz bottle. 2016 vintage. Appearance: Semi clear light golden with some haze, and minimal white head that disappears immediately. Almost still. 
Aroma: Like pumpkin pie with whipped cream. Toasted bread malt is prominent to go with the spicing. Really nice. 
Taste: Bready maltiness with great pumpkin spicing of cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg, turning to a light toast and some alcohol heat that accentuates the spice. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied for the strength, almost thin, with low carbonation and noticeable alcohol warmth. 
Finish: Spicy alcoholic breadiness lingers, with a touch of nutmeg and toast. 
Overall: Probably the best aroma on a pumpkin beer Ive had, it smells like the pie and whipped cream are right in front of you. I also like the bready, toasted maltiness that shows in the aroma and flavor. This beer does have room for improvement though. It has very little carbonation, and almost appears still. The high alcohol against the low body doesnt balance well, leaving a thin body that accentuates the alcohol heat. With a bit more carbonation and body Id rank this at the top of the pumpkin ale pile.","","TH28"

82,"2016-09-26",3.4,"2015 BJCP Category: 30B Autumn Seasonal Beer (base style: ?)
AROMA: Strong cinnamon graham cracker scent. Nutmeg is quite prominent along with a general autumn spicy aroma. Alcohol is present, but mostly as a background note. No distinctive malt or hop presence. 10/12APPEARANCE: Pumpkin skin bright orange. Very cloudy body with sediment floating in suspension. Small, beige, soapy foam dissipates quickly. 1/3FLAVOR: Mild base of pale and amber malts, though they are not especially sweet on their own. A honey/lemon flavor indicative of oxidation emerges towards the middle (though it blends with the palette). Cinnamon and nutmeg gently bite at the end with slight cracker/crust taste. Alcohol imparts a liqueur-type sensation. Palette has diminished with age but is still quite flavorful. Faint spicy hops. 14/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium body; low carbonation. Feels a bit flat in the mouth (but not slick). Alcohol warmth is fairly subtle and easily tolerated. Clean, dry aftertaste. 3/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: Tastes very good for a year-old vintage, but nothing was gained by aging this beer.

I dont remember enjoying it much in the past, but I think its pretty good now. It pours amber with average head and carbonation, the aroma is pumpkin spice and rich, sweet malt.

82,"2016-08-30",2.4,"22 ounce bottle from Woodmans in Rockford, IL, consumed a bit below cellar temp in a Konig Pils glass. Hazy bright orange, little head, fully diminishing...sweet pie-spice aroma, more spice than pumpkin probably - basically pumpkin cookies...on the tongue its booze immediately, and it doesnt let up; this is one of the more overtly alcohol-dominant beers of its strength Ive ever had, and its sort of a raw alcohol not all that well mixed with light vegetable/fruity notes and a bit of sharp hops towards the end (just a bit), with very little malt evident; touches of dark chocolate roastiness do appear eventually with some warmth, but its not enough. Rather thin - yet syrupy from the alcohol - low carbonation. I loved this beer when I first had it, probably 2009-10 or so, in part because it was a lot more ""pumpkiny"" than most other beers of its type that I could get then - Smuttynose was the only other one I remember liking at the time. And I usually bought it a couple of times every fall and still enjoyed it, but last year things started to change, possibly in me or possibly in the beer - or both as they have changed the recipe over the years - and this years model I find pretty hard to choke down, and probably wont finish the bottle.

It does not tast skunked, however, it has an umistakable bitterness of hasty handling. Maybe the smaller bottling is not an ideal delivery of the stuff.

The flavor profile is intense, complex and fairly well balanced considering the brewers desired effect - it comes at you like an unrestricted NASCAR racer at Dega (ie. over 220 mph). It begins by smashing you in the face with pumpkin, that then flows into a smash in the face of the aforementioned spices. Clove takes the lead in the middle and slowly fades into a vanilla note over a rich biscuit and bready sweetness.

82,"2014-08-08",4.1,"Sokputtonyos aszúhoz hasonló színe már önmagában szemet gyönyörködtető és elbűvölő, illata azonban minden várakozásunkat és a korábban hallottak alapján esetleg kialakult elvárásainkat is felülmúlja. Egy semmihez sem fogható aroma, melynek összetevői a pörkölt mogyoró és karamell, karácsonyi fűszerkeverék, valamint süteményes tészta a hozzá passzoló - esetleg éppen sütőtökös - krémmel. Ezt a fűszeres karaktert mesterien fokozza a whiskys alkoholosság enyhe pikantériája, mely a nyalánkságnak tűnő ital korhatáros voltát hivatott kihangsúlyozni. Teljesen újszerű és rendkívül szórakoztató az összkép, mely egy darabig önmagában is élvezettel tölt el minket, anélkül, hogy az ízében rejlő lehetőségek iránti kíváncsiságunkat kielégítenénk. A varázslat aztán folytatódik: mézeskalács, fahéj, dió és mogyoró, valamint sütőtökpüré bombázzák a receptorainkat - csupa-csupa ínyencség folyékony és pezsdítően élénk kivitelben. Semmi modorosság, semmi giccs, csak megnyerő stílus és rokonszenves, bájos karakter - bár ez utóbbit némileg megkeményíti az enyhén kikandikáló alkoholos beütés és a kissé éles végíz, melyekkel jómagam általában aligha foglalkozok, összességében (különösen a hőmérséklet emelkedésével) ugyanis lágy és szerethető karakterű. A desszertszerű hatás ez esetben magából a sör jellegéből következik hiteles természetességgel, nem érzünk benne semmi erőltetettséget, a hozzáadott cukortartalom agresszív egyeduralmát. Soha nem tapasztalt ízvilág részesei lehetünk, amennyiben módunkban áll kipróbálni ezt a csodát, mely izgalmas jellegével és magával ragadó karakterével a legelemibb szintű fogékonysággal rendelkezők szívébe minden bizonnyal azonnal belopja magát.","HUNGARY","adster"

82,"2014-07-30",4.2,"Transfer from BA review on 8-23-12- 
 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  Served a orange colored beer with almost no head. A very light film that is rather persistent does eventually fade leaving a light level of lacing.

 Smell Mostly of spice and pumpkin aroma. The cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice are complemented well with brown sugar, caramel and pumpkin aromas. Overall the spice is balanced by the sweet creating a pleasant liquid pumpkin pie smell.

 Taste  A sweeter caramel and pumpkin flavor greet the tongue. While light in the spice department initially, soon flavors of all the pie spices that were present in the nose come to fruition. As the taste advances further the pumpkin grows even stronger while the caramel get replaced by some brown sugar and hazelnut flavors. At the end one is left with a satisfying semi-sweet pumpkin flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  A medium and smooth body with a lighter level of carbonation. The creaminess and low carbonation coupled with the sweet pumpkin taste and spice make it very easy to drink. While at 8.6 % there is almost no boozy taste making this very easy to drink.

 Overall  A sweet delicious brew. Like drinking a smooth liquid pumpkin pie. While not one I would want with great occasion it is a perfect dessert beer for the cooler fall days.","","Darkmagus82"

The mid taste is sweet and smooth from the pumpkin and malt. The finish is slightly bitter, but not typical of hops.

82,"2013-10-31",3.7,"If youre going to make a great-tasting pumpkin beer, it has to be high in alcohol. This beer has just enough alcohol to make it great, while still being modest enough to prevent it from being too annoying. Its glassy clear, golden orange in color with a dense, fast-falling off-white head. The nose is strong of a well-balanced combination of spices and squash. This doesnt use your everyday bouquet of spices (no pumpkin pie here), rather an almost candy apple-like sticky, caramelized aroma with a gentle brushing of cinnamon, perhaps clove.

Its just the same in the mouth, but that sweetness is allowed to grace your palate with its concentrated, reduced-like pumpkin sweetness thats almost candy-like. Normally I prefer my pumpkin beer to be imperial stout in style, but that hides nearly all of the pumpkin character. This ale really does a great job of pleasantly showcasing the pumpkin flavors. Its thin, and manages to even introduce its flavors to your taste buds before the beer even enters your mouth. Super good for a non-imperial stout pumpkin ale. I can see this aging a year or two easily.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

I had this at a bar and bought a bottle to make sure of my conclusion. Second time is not a charm. Needs more flavor and hops. Seems a bit manufactured and without a natural flavor.","USA","brewballs"

82,"2013-08-24",4.0,"Pours a fine color amber clear with about a finger of loose foam that fell pretty quickly to a thick ring and a film on top. Left nice lace. Nose is pumpkin pie. Deep layered spices. Clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, pepper. A dry biscuit that is so very authentic. Brown sugar, toasted husky grains. Squash and pumpkin. Brown sugar and a light sweetness. Taste is out of this world. All the tastes of pumpkin pie except it has a sour aspect like a real pumpkin. Pumpkin is not sweet in and of itself. The malt is so deep and round and fat. its almost chewy but not quite. The ginger brightens it and gives it a lightness. There is no alcohol on the nose but just a little warmth at the back of the throat. Phenomenal! The malt sweetness is creamy and then there is a tiny bit of carbonation bite. Mouthfeel is substantial and full but not heavy. Finishes dry and with that dry biscuit and leading all those flavors home. 

This beer excites both the nose and the palate in so many ways. This has a strong character that is beer not desert. The sour bit of authentic pumpkin flavor make it for me. It gives it depth and a longevity on the palate. The balance is perfection. Its a pumpkin ale. You could serve it with gingerbread cookies or you could serve it with carrot and ginger soup.

The taste was much more intense than I was expecting, as there were flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg up front, followed by a surprising hop presence. The interplay between sweet, spicy, and bitter was very well done. The finish was dry, and showcased the spices. The body was a little thicker than medium, with a little sticky coating in the mouth.

82,"2013-08-23",4.1,"2013 vintage. Wow, I don't know how Southern Tier does it. This beer smells exactly like warm pumpkin pie. More like the buttery crust than the pumpkin filling. Reminds me of Thanksgiving day when mom was baking the desert pumpkin pies in the over while the Lions were playing (probably losing) the annual football game on TV. Mouthfeel is medium with little carbonation. Taste is buttery pumpkin pie with the filling made from scratch, fresh pumpkins and not the canned, commercial, more spiced filling. A great beer based on how they accurately duplicated the smell and taste. However, I wish it had more caramel and nutmeg flavors rather than the blander fresh pumpkin taste.

I split this one with my wife because she is a pumpkin FANATIC!

This is absolutely my favorite time of year, and the beers that come out during the fall season are second to none IMO. Even though I look forward to this one every year, this year is different...now I have tried the Schlaflys Pumpkin Ale (2nd behind this one on BA), and the one done by Williamsburg Alewerks (which I think is 3rd). Here is my 2010 review of this highly anticipated brew that was just released yesterday:

Ap: Copper color, very little head, and moderate carbonation.

Ar: Marshmallow, pumpkin, and even a bit of graham cracker. I mean, there is almost no trace that this is even a beer!

T: Pumpkin pie with the crust and all. Very strong whip cream aftertaste. I simple cant describe this as a beer, or using descriptors commonly associated with beer lingo (ex. hoppy, malty, etc.). The taste is in a class of its own in comparison to most pumpkin ales.

P: No alcohol burn, no hoppy sizzle, the malt is disguised as gourd. The minimal lacing that hits the glass quickly falls back into the dessert.

O: 9% AVB? I couldnt taste it. This stuff is just flat out dangerous. I know Im copping out, but I really want to try this one again next to Schlaflys. My wife likes Schlaflys better, but Im still not sure. The nose on this one alone may put it over the edge.","Washington DC, USA","Chaneybr"

The taste is as good as I imagine a pumpkin beer can get. All the pumpkin pie spices that are in the aroma are there along with a bit of actual pumpkin flavor.

Mouthfeel-Very light carbonation with a bit of warming booziness. 

Overall- The king of the pumpkin beers and a no brainer if its available.","","Brew42"

Appearance: The appearance is a bit disappointing here due to the lack of head, just a very thin off-white head with very poor retention. The body is a very hazy pumpkin color, almost opaque.
Aroma: The aroma is spot on for a desert, cinnamon graham cracker crust comes to mind with some vanilla, not much pumpkin but boy this smells excellent and a huge step away from the rest of pack.
Taste: The intro is a bit mild, hinting at spices while the mid-taste hits hard with the graham cracker crust and some light ginger and nutmeg, pumpkin is noted throughout. This is just a wonderful desert beer.
Palate Medium bodied, oily, with some light prickly carbonation.

82,"2012-09-05",3.1,"2012 22 oz bottle.  Poured into a Duvel glass.

This beer gives off one of the best first impressions I have ever seen,  If I would have rated it after my first couple of sips (or even first glass) it would have been rated much, much higher.  Beautiful golden orange color, fluffy head, and the aroma is pure liquid pumpkin pie.  I am amazed at the aroma Southern Tier gets out of some of their beers (Creme Brulee stout smells absolutely sublime).  The taste follows suit with a huge amount of pumpkin pie, vanilla, and even pie crust!  Pretty spectacular.

Funny thing happens the more you drink this beer and start to analyze the flavors.  They begin to taste more and more artificial.  What once tasted like fresh spices, pumpkin, vanilla and granola, begin to taste like extract forms of each flavor.  An overwhelming artificial butter flavor begins to come through (for me) and once that happened I found the beer harder and harder to enjoy.  I have now had several bottles and I unfortunately like it less and less each time.  Which is a shame, because that first glass was pretty amazing.","Miami, Florida, USA","tanis38"

82,"2012-09-05",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2013 22 oz. Bottle. Superb. Fresh, born on 6/28/12. Orange, deep copper pour, with a white head quick to dissolve to a ring. Medium body, silky feel, with a dry finish. Scent and taste were overwhelming pumpkin pie sweet, spice, nutmeg, a hint of clove, but mostly, similar to the sweet cream filled pumpkin roll you’d buy from an old lady at a bake sale. The only downside is a slightly bitter hint on the finish, but that was very minor compared to the overall taste. 

UPDATE: It seems as if here in 2013 every yuppy and their mother feels special drinking a Pumking, which means it's an intense competition to get ahold of this beer. And to be honest, I like Pumking, but I'm not so thrilled about having to outrun Buffy and Todd to get a bottle of it. For the time being until the pumpkin beer craze dies down, I'll stick with Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale - at least until the trend setters get ahold of it.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","PGHbeer77"

Now the smell was out of this world, exactly like my Grandmas fantastic homemade pumpkin pies (and she was a baker, btw, rest her soul). Theres no need to describe hops, malts, or anything else. It smells like Grandmas pumpkin pie at thanksgiving. End of story.

Taste - basically it tasted somewhat like it smelled, but a little more beer like. I can taste the hops just a little; their underlying bitterness gives this beer a sharp edge to go along with the pungent spices. Tons of pumpkin spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and even pepper stand out. Just a smidge nutty. Lightly sweet, not overtly so however. Its *really* spicy, like pumpkin pie on steroids. The alcohol probably adds to the spiciness, although its not actually very detectable in the taste.

Warms as it goes down, noticeably. Tangy, spicy aftertastes linger, with just a touch of bitterness. Medium body and low but ample carbonation.

Hazy dark orange in colour almost verging on a light rusty brown akin to the canal by the railway line in Kidsgrove, Staffs (that might mean something to someone !?!?!).

Smells sweet, spiced, cloves, a little pumpkin but not too so in my opinion, maybe some ginger in there?

Lots of flavours combine in this complex beer. Butterscotch, Pumpkin and sweet popcorn were the 3 headline flavours, these were backed up by nutmeg, clove, ginger, syrup and other spices.

Tastes as it smells with the strong cinnamon flavor coming through the rest of flavors this beer has to offer. Hops and malts are nowhere to be seen in the flavor. The finish is sweetish at first with a definite alcohol warmth, something I dont really like in a beer because it does leave somewhat of an unpleasant aftertaste.

Nice sweet nose with notes of nutmeg, pumpkin, cinnamon, toasted sugar. The mouth is moderately full. Carbonation is still good. I wasnt a huge fan of this beer fresh. I know this seems to be the standard for this style, but it was overly sweet and spiced I remember. I really liked this beer better with some age on it. The nutmeg is still there, but it is much more balanced with a mild sugary sweetness, backed up by a good pumpkin smack.

82,"2011-12-07",4.0,"Several bottles from multiple sources over the past couple of months. Clear, orange-gold pour with a short, off-white head leaving moderate lace. Nose is all pumpkin pie: sweet, nutty pumpkin, a bit of spice and a perfectly-baked, lard-laced, toasty crust. Medium body and moderate (fresh) to light (cellared) carbonation with a bit of ethanol burn in older bottles. The aroma is more of the same: pumpkin pie. Many pumpkin ales (including last years version of Pumking) are too spicy for me and Ive always preferred the more nutty, mildly sweet pumpkin beers that omitted the nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, etc. This one gets the spices just right and as a result the balance is perfect. Finish is long and tasty, with the same flavors as the body. Another thing this ale gets right is the inclusion of malts that replicate a tasty pie crust. Best fresh and from a properly refrigerated bottle, but still very good and worth seeking out any sample.","Lakewood, Washington, USA","TheRealMGD"

82,"2011-10-25",3.0,"The version I tried was the 2011 edition of Pumking. Aroma is sickly sweet and heavily spiced. First spices that come to mind are store-bought pumpkin pie, a spice that I want to say is cloves (I cant put my finger on the actual smell) and an extreme smell of fermentation. The taste is a lot of the same. The beer itself is very, very sweet and is balanced well by bitterness and salitness. This feels more like a fruit beer than a traditional ale. The flavors and sweetness are just so  overpowering for me. There is just so much body and so much sweetness that I cant handle it. Normally I love beers with lots of body, but Pumking tastes like what you would get if you put a pumpkin pie into a blender and let it sit for a few weeks until it started to ferment.

Funny thing, rice is not one of the ingredients listed on the bottle (which I thought would of been weird coming from a good brewery like ST). The spices show up in the back, way back. Same thing for the taste... big rice and spices in the background with a little alcohol. I must say it is well-hidden though, just warming up a bit for this autumn season.

Pour was a mildly fluffing orange jello liquid that was fairly resistant in forming a head. I thought it might be a bit cold it but certainly complied with the 40 degree guidelines on the label. The body looks more like a halloween mixer than a beer, with no lacing or head retention on the beer. Smell is nutty pumpkin rind like a pulpy mash before making pumpkin bread. Taste is very nutmeg heavy with nutty pumpkin and buttery squash. The taste is fleeting but also full with authentic flavor. Mouth was pleasantly medium, a nice surprise considering the visual. Pretty good pumpkin beer. Sweet, but its consistent with STs Modus Operandi. Not nearly as gimmicky as many other pumpkin beers.","Palm Desert, California, USA","cavery"

Its difficult to describe but I guess the first thing I notice is the tasted of pie crust...flaked barley, wheat and hazelnut.  It gives it a unique grainy, doughy, nutty malt profile.  Next you notice the spot on spiced pumpkin pie flavor...cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, vanilla and some vegetal pumpkin.

Opened and poured into a pint glass. Not much of a scent to this. Maybe my proboscis is off tonight. It looks clean and clear which is contrary to many of my more favored pumpkin style beers. Looks like a nice lager.

The taste is VERY surprising. Just like the creme brulee by ST, this tastes just like a dessert, in this case, pumpkin pie. Very smooth, non-biting taste to this. My wife quite likes this beer. The mouthfeel is adequate and if it was a little thicker it may be too much like eating than drinking this.

A bit of froth that offers an impression of the whipped cream on your pie. Smell offers pumpkin along with pie spices and... crackers?   Yup, Saltines, to be exact. I dont know why, I,m just rating as I drink it. Taste IS indeed a mouthful of pumpkin pie. Theres the slightly sweet vegetal taste of baked pumpkin, just enough spice to balance that out, not just nutmeg but a touch of cinnamon and cardamon too. Taste closes out dry, which hides the slightly elevated alcohol below notice, Although some sips also end up with a note of whipped cream topping. This is a goodun.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

The aroma is stunning: dry pumpkin hits right upfront, all the way to my sinuses, with some light booze and sweet caramel and toffee malt presence. Wow this is inviting. Flavour is even more impressive. Loads of straight up pumpkin spice, with some other ubiquitous spice (coriander, cardamon, cinnamon), but what stands out is this kettle pop corn deliciousness. I cant get over, its so damn perfect! Usually corn flavour of any kind turns me off, but this here is fantastic. Also reminds me of graham crackers and cheerioes. The feel is also amazing.

82,"2011-09-26",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2012 Copper golden orangish very clear color.Thin ring of foam after a quick receding head.Aroma is mostly graham.Flavor is alot of graham,definatly unique in aroma and taste its smooth bready grahamy pumpkiny with some tart almost roast like bitterness(fairly bitter) to finish with a lingering graham kinda sticky taste.Not traditionally spiced but maybe just a lot of nutmeg,the graham flavor seems a bit cloying,good beer but dont think im getting another one of these,ill take another smashed pumpkin though. I dont think ive had a graham pumpkin pie crust pie before but  they put in a  very good effort for simulating a pie flavor and aroma.Graham and pumpkin dont seem to fit together well.

First taste is hazelnut then some spiciness, an out of place hop bitterness, and then some faint booziness.  The flavors are strong but seem totally out of balance to me.  They do not blend well -- its almost like doing  beer mat shot.  Ill give it this: the pumpkin flavor is believable and not some overly spiced concoction that is supposed to represent pumpkin.

Ill preface this review with two biases I hold. 1) To date every ""pumpkin ale"" I have had, has tasted like nutmeg and cinnamon. Not a terrible thing, but the pumpkin has always been faint. Even my beloved DFH punkin ale was all spice. 2) Southern tier makes overly sweet dessert beers.

A - Not what I expected at all. The body is very light. Its an amber/orange body. Looks very much like an IPA, and not the brown/darker ales Im used to for this style. I got a tiny off-white head that dissipated pretty quickly.

S - Pumpkin! This is the first beer that I have successfully picked up on that note. Very earthy squash aromas followed by a spice note that reminds me of Quaker cinnamon and spice instant oatmeal. Tons of bready malts which give the illusion of a graham cracker crust.

T - Follows the nose very closely. Earthy pumpkin notes and spice. Cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, and whatever else goes into a pumpkin pie. Loads of bready malts. The spice is very light and balanced though. The mouth-feel is pretty thin but it works since the flavors arent that intense. 8-9% abv? No way...

O - Not what I was expecting at all. It was a bit thin and the aroma and taste reminded me of ¢25 packets of oatmeal which I made growing up. However the pumpkin was real and noticeable. A super fresh example of a beer Ive been dying to try since I missed it last year. A very successful pumpkin beer, but I have yet to find one that is excellent.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Smells creamy and a lot like a muted pumpkin. But not quite pumpkin at the same time. Very subtle hints of pumpkin spice come out as it warms. Some caramel and vanilla is also present.
Wow! This stuff tastes almost like a pumpkin pie mixed with whipped cream. It is very creamy tasting. The spices are mixed just right and dont take away from the beer lying beneath it at all. The caramel is in the taste as is the vanilla. And a bit of a nutty flavor as well. And of course the pumpkin also come through. A bit of hop bitterness pokes through. Very well made. Wish I could make my pumpkin beer taste this good.
A creaminess coats the mouth. The spices pop out for a bit, but fade behind the creaminess very quickly. The hops linger around a bit more than I was expecting, making a bit of bitterness linger in the mouth. This bitterness overpowers the rest of the beer and sticks to the mouth until you swallow some more. Not bad, but a bit too strong.

82,"2010-11-04",3.2,"Bomber from LCBO, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. 
App.:  Clear light amber with a decent orange-light tan head.
  
Aroma:  Strong, almost offensively strong nutmeg, with a bit of ginger, really string and aggressive spicing, very pumpkin pie-like, pie crust, malty, almost a cream-like note (whipped cream on top??), so close to pumpkin pie it is ridiculous.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, moderate, yet rounded effervescence.
  
Flav.:  A little less aggressive than the nose, still a fair hit of nutmeg, with some ginger and less-than-desired cinnamon and all-spice, quite pumpkin-y, more pumpkin than the nose and less pie, still kinda pie, some pie crust; dry with fair bitterness and a spicy, slightly malty finish.

Different from other pumpkin beers.  Not that this is a good thing...","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"

82,"2010-11-02",3.5,"650 ml bottle from LCBO.  I think they mixed it up with Ontarios Great Lakes Brewery Pumpkin Ale.  Pours a nice amber, modest head.  Really does smell like pumpkin pie -- great.  Tastes like pumpkin pie mixed with beer, which it turns out is not exactly my thing, but ok.  Kind of sweet.  Pleasant, rich mouthfeel.  Good with spicy salmon dish.","Windsor, Ontario, CANADA","dedelste"
82,"2010-11-01",3.8,"Pours a brilliantly clear orange, topped with an ivory crown with lace laying in no discernible pattern. 

Well if Pumpkin beers are meant to smell like pumpkin pie, this hits the nail on the head. The aroma is so easily recognizable as pumpkin pie crust its ridiculous. Close your eyes and take a whiff, its hard to imagine your actually smelling a liquid. Besides the dark breaded crust lies aspects of cinnamon and brown sugar. For all intents and purposes this is what I expect a Pumpkin Beer to smell like.  

That taste is a seamless continuation of the smell. Bready flavors, pie crust, and nutmeg dominate. A caramel sweetness is delicately balanced beneath. The Pumpkin Meter reads an above average 7.5 out of 10. Its not overbearing in spice, but easily identifiable in every sip. I tend to like the pumpkin toned down a notch which this beer accomplishes. Not forgotten in the mix is a solid hoppy bitterness rounding out a well balanced pumpkin beer. At first I wasnt sure I was digging Pumking, but as I slowly sipped the 22 ounces grew on me. At 9% ABV it has a bit of a kick with a crisp smooth mouth feel. Obviously this isnt your daily drinking session beer, but it makes for an excellent choice come Halloween. In fact, I may just say it is the best Pumpkin Beer I have had to date and would be a perfect accompaniment to some tasty holiday desserts.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

Fresh, but soft, pumpkin follows with a kick of spice in the finish.  Some caramel and perhaps orange peel tries to mix in.  A bit strange, but what the heck, its a pumpkin beer.  This is surprisingly drinkable for the alcohol content and doesnt suffer from being overly sweet.  As far as pumpkin beers go, this is one of the best Ive had and I can see why its highly regarded.

T- Very Creamy in texture, also fairly bitter feeling and a heavy aftertaste of the hops. The spices are not very pronounced at all. The Pumpkin flavour is very strong here which is really nice, but the hoppy bitterness doesnt compliment it very well.

82,"2010-09-22",4.0,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Buy Rite - Jersey City, 9/22/10


Aroma: Nose has lots of spice (pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg), and sweetness (vanilla, candied sugar)

Appearance: It pours a clear golden-orange color with a small white head that leaves light lace

Flavor: The taste is somewhat sweet, balanced by a nice spice feel, and a little bit of bitterness

Palate: It has a medium body, a nice balanced and drinkable feel, and a smooth spicy finish

Overall Impression: 
A pumpkin beer from Southern Tier, one of my favorite styles from one of my favorite breweries, and some how Ive never rated it.  Quite a surprise.  
Anyway, I was expecting it to be pretty good, and I wasnt disappointed.  This is some quality stuff, it is well-balanced and highly drinkable.  Im a fan, but Ill admit, Im a bit bias.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Its very smooth and creamy with a medium, oily mouthfeel.


9/19/2010:  (2, 3, 7, 3, 15 = 3)  Oh I wanted to like this so bad, but the aroma.  OHH the aroma is so bad. It smells like corn on the cob. Not that thats a bad smell, but it shouldnt be the smell of a beer. Its so corny and buttery, I dont know what its about.

82,"2010-09-17",4.3,"The scent of nutmeg really stood out on first sniff, and it still is a large portion of the aroma for me.  What a monster brew.  I first thought the spices were a bit overdone, but a few sips remedied that.  Its not as boozy as I thought it would be, and not overly sweet either.  There is a lot of pumpkin here, and any more would probably take it over the pumpkin threshold.  I have had several pumpkin beers over the years, and this is definitely the best one I had tried yet.  Weyerbacher makes a tamer version, if this one is too much.  I hate to do another Charlie Brown comment, but tell Linus to go get his blanket, grab Sally, and head out to the pumpkin patch.

82,"2010-09-16",4.0,"Good grief Charlie Brown! I cant believe the aromas that are creeping out of my glass. If this only has puréed pumpkin in it then I must say kudos because this smells and tastes in part of the finest pumpkin pie spice that I could ever imagine indulging in. Its almost overwhelming to try to distinguish what else is going on here and I really dont care! That said, very sweet pumpkin and malty aroma that overshadow whatever hop aromas may be present. Beautiful orange amber color, clear, little carbonation. Taste is pumpkin...go figure...but I can tell there is some medium caramel malt sweetness in there and some nice resiny hop bitterness to balance. Sweet and silky on attack. Medium body. Moderate carbonation, creamy and sticky texture and a lovely lengthy well balanced finish that lets the hops do their job. Im a big fan of Southern Tier and cant believe how many great beers they have in their Imperial series alone! This is no exception. Definitely get a few of these and dont forget to stash one away for Thanksgiving, because you will be the hit of the party and this is one to truly be thankful for!","Portland, Oregon, USA","hoptimist"

On the whole, the flavors felt muted. Much better than the Shipyard pumpkin ale. More pumpkiny than the New Holland Ichabod, but I have to give the higher ranking to the Ichabod as a matter of personal taste and preference for more spice.

Its a weird beer for sure for me. It tastes like pumpkin pie that is not very sweet and a few days past its prime. I really dont understand the love for this beer. Sweet malty upfront flavor followed by an odd pumpkin spice kick at the end that lingers far too long. Medium mouthfeel.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
82,"2010-09-09",3.5,"Pumkin beers tend to be great for a second and then pretty awful by the end of the glass so its pretty impressive that this remains drinkable throughout especially at such high gravity. The color is an appropriate orange the head is white and fine bubbled but it doesnt last long. The nose on this is really nice. It is basically just a bastard ton of nutmeg but it works because its backed by a cookie like malt character, making this smell like a pumpkin pie baking in the oven. The flavor doesnt quite match this richness, mostly because it is a bit more dry than expected but it is this dryness that lends it the drinkability which makes it really stand out. The carbonation, which is rather unexpectedly heavy, helps in this regard as well. Southern Tier is not a perfect brewer by any means but they do make some interesting stuff as far as flavored beers go and anyone whos into spiced beers would do well to check this out.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The aroma is heavy on the cinnamon and nutmeg--egg nog like--with a less prominent, but still deep, sweet aroma of pumpkin pie.  The taste is quite pumpkin-like as well: A sweet and deep pumpkin flavor, mixed with cinnamon, nutmeg, and some caramel and toast maltiness.  It is also slightly citrusy on the front and back, with an aggressive hoppiness throughout.  Mouthfeel is medium, with strong carbonation, a carbonic bite, and spikey bitterness on the middle and finish, accompanied by the pumpkin sweetness as well.  A very interesting and complex beer, with that hop addition.  However, the slight citrus undertone does seem a bit off with the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Great nonetheless.","New York, USA","Chronoflash"

D: Well, the 9% abv does not come through at all; it is quite sweet, but it is a very nice dessert beer and tremendously better than any other other pumpkin beer Ive tried. It is also a nice change from other dessert type beers like imperial stouts and barleywines.","Pennsylvania, USA","stimulus"
82,"2010-08-23",3.8,"draft. Clear pour, thin frothy head.  Smells just like a pumpkin pie, perfect combo of spices in the nose with a vivid squashy undertone, very nice nose really.  Flavors have the same with a little yeastiness and hot alcohol thrown into the mix.  I like it though...flavors arent as focused as the nose, but whaever..may be a bit hot around the edges but maybe it should be for a novemberish beer.

Clear deep golden colour with tiny off-white head.

82,"2010-06-12",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2010 UPDATE: Ive had this one again a couple times recently and just have had a really bad experience with it so Im adding to my previous review and adjusting the sores accordingly...
----- BOTTLE (drank & reviewed on 09.28.10):
Pours a mostly clear light amber/orange. Decent amount of foamy white head but nothing spectacular. Really surprised at the clarity here.

Smell is nice - spicy with a bit of pumpkin coming through.

Flavor is almost purely spices - I get very little actual pumpkin here. Mostly all spice, nutmeg and cinnamon. The alcohol provides a gentle warmth as well.

Mouthfeel is good. Well carbonated and quite lively.

There is a strange aftertaste that I really did not enjoy - combine that with the high abv and the drinkability of this one takes a bit of a hit.

Overall Im quite disappointed with this. Had two bottles of it on two separate occasions and had the same underwhelming experience both times. I had high hopes after several friends told me it was the best pumpkin beer out there, but all in all Im very let down. 

Will not most likely be drinking this again.

------- MONTH OLD BOTTLE (drank & reviewed on 06.12.10):
Pours a nice, if somewhat generic, golden color with a small amount of head. A bit of lacing is left behind as you drink.

Aroma is where this beer TRULY shines. A VERY distinct aroma of pumpkin pie overpowers your senses as you sniff. The flavor is similar but the pumpkin flavor is a bit reserved when compared to the aroma (this may be due to the fact that this bottle is probably 8 months old at this point...)

All in all a very tasty beer and something I would definitely drink again.

82,"2010-04-21",3.8,"A- Completely transparent amber (pumpkin) colored body that pours with one finger white head. Head has medium strength retention but eventually fades to nothing. No collar. No lacing left behind in the glass.

S- Wow. A big whiff of pumpkin hits first. Big cinnamon and nutmeg spices hit second with a solid caramel malt backbone.

T- Lots of pumpkin flavor upfront with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel malt. Finish is slightly stronger than initial flavor with the addition of a spicy hop bite. Lots of pumpkin, caramel, and spiciness linger on the palate. This tastes like liquid pumpkin pie. It really does. 100% like liquid pumpkin pie.

P-Low carbonation and reasonably thick mouthfeel. Somewhat difficult to swallow.

O- This is the most pumpkin tasting pumpkin ale I have had as of yet. And 9% ABV? I never would have guessed that. There is no detection of alcohol anywhere in this brew. I really love Southern Tier and I am on a Southern Tier kick right now. They really put out great beers that are great examples of the style. As far as Pumpkin Ales go-I do think I enjoy Weyerbacher a hair more due to its spiciness; but this brew definitely has more authentic pumpkin flavor.

82,"2010-02-20",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2013 This is a really unique pumpkin concoction that is essentially a desert beer. It is REALLY sweet for a pumpkin beer. Take a sniff, and youll get pumpkin cake with icing. I dig this stuff, but it is a one-pint kind of beer. Just too sweet to sit with all day.  I really love it as an alternative to your typical pumpkin ale, though, but it can be hard to find.  Seems like it hits the shelves and is gone within a week or two. EDIT: After drinking this again this past fall on a couple occasions, Im updating and downgrading my rating.

The smell is very very weird. Powerful pumpkin aromas, holiday spices (nutmeg, cinnamon), bread crumbs, dough and a general character of pie. Gingerbread snaps. Notes of oranges. Perhaps some malts beneath this pumpkin pie madness. I actually like this, in a strange way.

The taste is not as crazy as the smell, but its still rather weird. Again, pumpkin and spicy pie flavors dominate. Its sweet with lots of fruity notes (pumpkin, oranges). Notes of nutmeg and cinnamon levels the sweetness a bit. Lots of dough character - its like drinking a pumpkin pie. At times, I think I can even taste pie crust. The finish is somewhat bitter, which is quite pleasant here, and has notes of pumpkin and spices. No sign of the alcohol.

Medium body, easy to drink. Moderate carbonation. Slightly dry finish.

This is one strange beer. However, I must say I enjoyed it. It definitely achieves what it sets out to achieve - being one big pumpkin beer. I wouldnt want to drink a whole lot of it though, nor drink it very often.

Grainy, sort of reminds of a cross between malt extract syrup and the host of scents wafting around a homebrew store.  Taste is overly sweet (underattenuated?), though the resolve to a dry finish reveals tons of vanilla and whip cream notes, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  Yams?  I was skeptical at first, but the alcohol is very well hidden, and the lasting after-effect is resoundingly of Thanksgiving!  Rosi says it tastes like Lebkuchen.  Man, delicious! [11/7/2009: 3.7]2013, this time very fresh.  This bottling is much the same, still a bit overloaded in areas, a bit childish, perhaps less pumpkin and more spice, but still easy-going for its size.

Farmgirl Saison. The Pumking had a small head that was mostly gone by the time my glass got to my table, but the sweet and spicy pumpkin aroma was still there. Al the stuff you would expect in a pumpkin pie is in this beer and the sweetness doesnt overpower. This was a completely satisfying beer that didnt taste much like a beer or ale. It probably isnt the beer I would have ordered to go with my buffalo burger, but the sweetness was moderated and the spice was not overpowering. I made several calls around town when I got home that evening and it was gone from the shelves in stores. Bummer. Im going to be watching for this one next year, though.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","allendodd"

Full notes of pie crust as well.  Color is rather transparent and a standard orange gold.  Flavor is much like the aroma, with the soft, sweet pumpkin notes kind of subdued by the spice, which I would take or leave.

Somewhat clear burnt orange with thin off-white head that doesnt leave much behind.

Pumpkin galore - sweet pumpkin pie aroma with lots of spice, such as cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, with a dollop of creme. Do not smell much beer in there, but that is fine; it smells delicious.

Very spicy and pumpkin-like. Surprisingly, a lot of the spiciness seems to come from the hops. Somewhat sweet pumpkin pie is evident and it does taste as if there is whipped cream. The alcohol is a little too noticeable.

Moderate carbonation, creamy body, pretty dry body despite the sweet pumpkin taste.

Starts off with a orange/reddish body that screams fall. Great, two-inch head. The aroma is amazing, not only because of the depth and complexity of the things that I smelled, but because of how closely it mimicked a fresh baked pumpkin cake that was just pulled from the oven and covered in a sugary glaze. Fantastic. The aroma is so perfect though, that there is no way the body can stand up to it. Now, dont get me wrong, the body is great and my rating with reflect that,  but the aroma is just that perfect. Phenomenal when fresh and on tap.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"
82,"2009-10-26",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2010 Bottle from Arena Liquors in Columbia, Missouri.  Pours a clear amber color with a small white head.  Really nice aroma of pumpkin seeds, nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar, caramel malt, red apples, alcohol, vanilla, ginger, and allspice.  The flavor is also a nice, complex balance of those elements along with a nice hoppy bite.  Smooth palate, light-medium bodied.  Outstanding- the best pumpkin ale Ive ever had.  RE-RATE, 8/27/10.  Draft served in a Southern Tier tulip at International Tap House in Soulard.  Very, very sweet nose and flavor.  It occurred to me that this beer isnt necessarily a lot like just pumpkin or pumpkin pie, but rather pumpkin pie crust.  Once this idea was put in my head by another guy a few weeks ago, I agree 100%- pie crust.  Brown sugar galore, graham cracker, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Dont get me wrong, the usual pumpkin beer notes are there, but this is pie crust all the way.  Medium-bodied, with a sticky mouthfeel and low carbonation.  Very sweet.  I like it a lot.  RE-RATE again, 10/2/10: I love the smell of this- sweet, brown sugary, toasty, and a little spicy, just like pumpkin pie crust.  The flavor, however, washes out all of that a little bit.  The body, mouthfeel, and flavor notes just dont live up to it.  Its not bad at all, and certainly interesting, but Im let down when I actually taste this.  Some vegetal notes murky it up, too.  Not bad, but Id take Schlaflys Pumpkin Ale over this.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

82,"2009-10-23",3.8,"First off, I dislike pumpkins, my wifes mother bought this for me because they didnt have one of the beers I told her to get, so a lad a Austin Liqours picked this out instead. I infact, dont like pumpkins, pumpkin bread, pumpkin pie, or pumpkin pudding, if its a food that starts with pumpkin I have a natural loathing towards it. That being said, this beer isnt bad. I wouldnt ever buy it again, because, like I said, I dont like pumpkins, however, it IS a well crafted brew, and that much I can appreciate. The beer pours a manuka honey gold, with a shortly lived head. The aroma is....oh my stars.....pumpkin.....pumpkin pie to be exact, and i do mean EXACT. The flavour follows suit with a liquid replica of pumpkin pie. with an underlying sweetness that I find to be very well balanced with a sour/bitter hop bite all the way through and on to the finish.

Way over the top. Distinctly sweet mouthfeel. Im not generally a huge fan of pumpkin beers and this didnt do anything to change my mind. The redeeming feature was that it is a big beer so there is an alcohol warmth and some other elements (touches of fruity malt?) to provide token competition for the spices. But I cant say it was a particularly enjoyable experience overall.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
82,"2009-10-21",3.0,"Pumpkin beers are reason #3646 to love the Fall.  Its not hard to market a beer that tastes like a drinkable pumpkin pie.  But the flipside of this seasonal treat is that there are a lot of pumpkin beers out there that dont taste like pumpkin at all.  And sadly, Southern Tiers Imperial Pumking is one of them.  And whats more, this beer came as a recommendation from my local Whole Foods beer monger as a complement to a bottle of Elysian Night Own (my favorite pumpkin beer of all).  Like others, the Imperial Pumking develops a thin, white head, and the body is a plain, unadorned orange, with a semi-transparency that does little to hint at the particularly and iconically orange ingredients involved.  And from this unassuming orange puddle comes an intensely sweet, perfume-of-candy-shop and creamy aroma.  Clove, pumpkin spices, and, in something of a trailblazing move in pumpkin beers, a heavy scent of whipped cream.  I also detect heavy caramelized aromas, most especially the distinct smell of baked pie crust.  But when the Pumkings flavor tries to imitate the aroma, it becomes a disaster.  Immediately the flavor is pronounced cloying - far, far too sweet, like a cream soda with pumpkin and vegetal notes, but the pumpkin is faint, its decrees a tinny echo in overcrowded room.  Thick, sweet flavors like yam repeat their mantra, again and again, muting the pumpkin and covering my palate with the flavor of that ubiquitous Thanksgiving treat: marshmallow and yam casserole.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

82,"2009-10-21",3.9,"Definitely the best pumpkin ale I have ever had and the only one that deserves the name.  Smells just like pumpkin pie and tastes as well.  Not for everyone, but very festive.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","jameswolfe"
82,"2009-10-20",4.3,"Bottle from Village Beer Merchant.  Alright, this became one of top 5 favorite beers 2 years ago and cemented my love of Southern Tier Brewing, so I might still be biased......Pours a straightforward clear golden color with a small beige head that dissipates in a few minutes.
Aroma is soooooo nice:  Toasty malt, pumpkin pie spice, and the faint vegetable scent of pumpkin innards.
Mouthfeel: Creamy with average carbonation, light alcohol burn that is not as well hidden as last year.
Taste:  Hoppier than last year...Southern Tier just cant stay away from the hops. While this isnt neccesarily a bad thing, fans of the last few vintages pure sparkling pumpkin pie flavor might be a bit letdown.  The hop bitterness kind of binds itself with the spice bitternessm in the middle, but the finish is the same toasted malt and pumpkin pie as previous years with a more noticable, but not overwhelming sweet alcohol flavor and burn.

Still one of my favorites that I will highly recommend, and still my favorite pumpkin ale.  I love hops, so the addition of more of them didnt change my love of this autumnal treat. Since the hoppy Harvest Ale from the same brewer uses some similar hops, adding a splash of King to it actually works.  Although, trying this beer with vanilla ice cream brought out all the vegetable qualities to the forefront in a strange way...I think Ill be sipping my Pumking untainted from here on out.","Buffalo, New York, USA","VillageBeerVin"

I taste clove, pumpkin, malty sweetness, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar.  Full flavored, and not like a typical brown ale plus a few spices, which is the way some brewers seem to do it.  When it is fresh, you can really taste the vegetal pumpkin flavor, but after a couple of months the flavor smooths out some. This is excellent - Is it the highest rated pumpkin ale?  Adrian thinks it should be, and I concur.  Hats off to Puca!  Pumking is a worthy way to toast in the Halloween season.","USA","Slipstream"

82,"2009-10-05",3.9,"Serving: 22 oz. bottle.
Appearance: Deep, translucent amber-orange with a very small, foamy, white head.  The head is gone pretty quickly.
Aroma: Grainy pumpkin bread, earthy, and doughy.  Strange stuff indeed.  
Flavor: Very similar to the nose but heavy on the pumpkin spice, especially the clove.  Like a dense, slightly bitter pumpkin pie.  Interesting and pretty tasty.
Palate: Medium carbonation with a dense, rich, mouthfeel.  A long, pumpkin pie spice finish.
Overall: A great example of the style that is worth giving a try.  This one isnt going to be for everyone though.  My girlfriend though it was like drinking a pumpkin candle.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

82,"2009-10-03",4.4,"Appearance: Pours out a clearish, deep orange body with a tall-standing, frothy, white head.

Smell: All rights, friends, so, it smells greatly of oven-fresh pumpkin pie. Whos with me? Who the HAPPY HALLOWEEN is with me?

Taste: Sweet caramel malts plunged deep into fresh pumpkin puree and liberally coated in a pumpkin pie spice blend and smoothed over with a touch of vanilla creme. Im sure its been said dozens of times over, but its rather pumpkin pie-like, with the malts even mimicking a flavor of rich, crisp graham cracker crust garnished with candy corn. Subtle hop presence and bitterness. Drying finish with a lingering spiced pumpkin taste and some slight alcohol warmth.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Excellent for a pumpkin ale! Look, whoever is giving you advice like, ""dont bother with Pumking"" is no friend of yours.

Tastes better than the best baked winter squash Ive ever eaten.  Mellow spice, nice brown sugar complexity hidden in there, a bit of banana bread or carrot cake in there too.

Aroma is insane. I have never smelled these notes in a beer: gingerbread house, cinnamon roll, carrot cake with lots of cream cheese icing. Taste is a bit of creamy, spicy pumpkin pie but then becomes mostly carrot cake with a nice hoppy bite at the end. Hoppiness at the end becomes a bit soapy. 9% is very well hidden.

I cant believe what Im smelling, it smells so good I almost dont want to drink it for fear that the taste with let me down and thus ruin the aroma for me. Not to worry, the nose comes through in the flavor! Taste is smooth with mild carbonation and slightly bitter pumpkin pie filling, carrot cake flavor with a slight hint of malt and hops. Alcohol is very mild as well, making this brew hard to keep in the glass, but it does catch up to you before long.

The aroma is of pumpkin spice but there is also a weird sweetness of brown sugar to it or maybe a bit of butternut squash.  The taste tends to be both sweet and sour with a strong dose of pumpkin spice and hops along with something smooth and sweet. And theres also something tart.  This is truly a complex seasonal and is one of the more unique pumpkin spice brews I have ever had.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

82,"2009-09-23",4.1,"22oz bottle. Pours a crystal clear, golden-amber body with a thin, fizzy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a soft lacing. Aroma is great. Lots of pie crust biscuits, pumpkin pie filling, and plenty of harvest spices. Lots of nutmeg and a touch of cinnamon make this more sweetly spiced than sharp. Abundant pumpkin pie aroma makes me salivate and almost tempts me to top this with whipped cream. The flavor is very sweet with more of that pie crust and biscuit up front before more sweet pumpkin pie filling comes in. The spices quickly become acquainted, more so than the aroma. They give off more of a perfume-like taste and distinctness that makes them stand out more towards the backend along with a light, pumpkin hop bitterenss. Along with the added spice and bitterness comes just a trace of alcohol that lightly warms my throat after a dry and spicy, but sweet pumpkin pie filling finish. Lingers with plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg for a medium to long amount of time. Lighter bodied, extremely clean, smooth, and very balanced for a 9%ABV beer. Overall, a very memorable pumpkin ale. Extremely aromatic and just as flavorful. Great body and balance make this one of my favorite fall ales to date. Mmmm the spell has been cast!","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

New 2010 Recipie:
Pours a clean orange with a half finger off-white fluffy head. Aroma of pumpkin, vanilla, butterscotch. caramel and cream. Medium bodied with a firm, agrresive, yet also soft, supple, and rich mouthfeel. Very well balanced carbonation, but very toned down pumpkin flavor. Much more vanilla and maltiness. Overall, I prefer the inital Pumking recipe. The over-the-top pumpkin pie flavor of the original was something truly unique. While this is still the king of all pumpkin beers, it would serve the brewers well to return to form and get back to brewing liquid pumpkin pie. Either way, cheers.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"

The caramel malt is quite obvious in the flavor, as is the roasted pumpkin (a bit different than the pumpkin in most brews).  Hops make an appearance, but are blended in with nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, ginger, and that crazy squash flavor!

If you like pumkin pie this is one of the best beer aromas you will  probably smell in quite a while, otherwise you may dislike it. The taste is much the same, though there is also a few notes of ripe fruit like figs and possibly plums. The overall taste is that of spices and cinnamon, but it also very well balanced with a nice taste of pumpkin permeating. An excellent and balanced beer for the fall season.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","ruskiimperial"

Has become my gold standard for pumpkin beers.---- Original rating 08/22/09 Pours a thin but vibrant orange, slight red tint, headless. Intense aroma of pumpkin bread, sugar cookies, brown sugar, dates. Smells like Im about to eat dessert. Flavor is slightly buttery with some pumpkin bread. Some notes of figs and dates as well. Overall the flavor is fairly subtle, especially in relation to the intense aroma. Bitter hoppy finish with a slight alcohol burn. The aroma doesnt match what youd expect from the flavor.

Cant say accurately about the appearance because of it not being filtered yet and coming from a holding tank that hasnt yet bottled the beer. But the flavor was bliss. There was a very prevalent pumpkin note with some spices of coriander, cinnamon, little vanilla, and others. Now, the fact that I had it so fresh from the batch might have a little to do with the flavor rating but I will wait till they bottle and sell it first. Sweet, spicy, and a tad milky with a touch of sour. I would almost consider this a desert rather than a beer...","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","MrBeerFanatic"
82,"2009-07-04",3.3,"Maybe I have lost my affection for Pumpkin beers, or maybe this was a structural mess? Poured beautifully, golden orange body and a frothy ivory head.

It was not sour, like infected, but like spoiled milk. My wife, lover of pumpkin beers, poured hers out. The spices seemed distorted and contrived, like they had come from an extract rather than raw ingredients just not a fan.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

82,"2009-05-09",4.2,"Clear orange, her body is aglow with amber highlights, free to shine in anticipatory brilliance as there is neither head nor lace to interfere. I dont even need to raise the glass to my nose to find myself enveloped in the richest pumpkin nose I have ever encountered. Creamy pumpkin pulp. Warm gooey pie dough. Ginger, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, and vanilla mingle in a perfect blend of spices. Rich condensed milk and coconut milk sop it all up in a sweet, spiced, pumpkin delight. I could smell this beer for minutes on end and be fully content doing so, but where is the fun in that. Savoring my first quaff, her mouthfeel is clean and balanced with a medium weight which lightly coats my tastebuds. Fresh pumpkin and spice lingers on top of my tongue while soft pie crust gives her some chewy meatiness. A light, dry, herbal finish lingers in my breath with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and all-spice. The sweetened condensed milk and coconut milk which pervaded her nose also pervades her palate, though in a more subdued manner. Milky, creamy, lightly sweet with hints of tropical esters, she cradles all within her beery depths. Each savory quaff sends chills up and down my spine, and far too quickly my glass is exhausted. A lingering warmth whispers of pumpkin and spice while a creamy coating lingers atop my tastebuds.


Hands down, the best pumpkin beer available today. I havent had previous years, but from what I have heard amongst my fellow beer geeks, each year Pumking reigns on high atop his throne of Pumpkin Beerdom. I am definitely going to make a point of tracking down this beer when fall comes to pass once more.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

82,"2009-03-28",3.3,"Bottle - Pours a golden amber with a very little head. I thought this would look sexier, but the smell makes up for it a bit. I get a bit of hops on the first whiff, but then the pumpkin and spice hit--pretty much exactly like pumpkin pie, with crust and all. I get a lot of nutmeg with a little mandarin orange in the background. no clue where that came from. Anyways, the taste is pretty much the same pumpkin pie taste that finishes with a stale hops taste. A sweet, malty backbone lingers after its all swallowed, along with some cinnamon. Its silky, medium-bodied with mild carbonation. This was about what I expected, but the stale hops on the end really turned me off. Had they tasted fresher, or if this had just bypassed the hops and finished smoothly into the sweet maltyness, this would have been much better.

You know how a pumpkin smells when you are carving a jack-o-lantern? Thats how this beer tastes. It also has some strong bready notes and light pumpkin spice. The overall sense though is vegetal. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy thick and oily. Not bad, but not what I was expecting.

Dogfish Head Punkin Ale is a better beer, but doesnt taste nearly of pumpkin the way this does.

I get mainly pumpkin and cinnamon.  However, there are some other aromas.  There is an almost funkiness to it, but not in a bad way.  The taste is interesting.

82,"2008-10-16",4.0,"V - clear golden orange color, right off the bat reminds me of a pumpkin. Very small, practically non-existent head. 
A - the pumpkin aroma (nutmeg, clove, cinnamon) is incredibly potent, able to get whiffs of it from three feet away. Close up, the nutmeg is almost overpowering. Very pleasant. 
T - follows up on the aroma but introduces a creamy richness from some hops and just a touch of malt.
P - after the strong aroma, the taste is almost too much and this is one of the very very few spiced ales that I think might benefit from a more mild taste in order to let the nose of the beer do the work.

It smells so much like a freshly baked irish pumpkin bread with a hint of peppermint in the nose finish. The flavour is just like the aroma. Dry baked bread slowly envelops the palate as the brew sits on the tongue. Carrot and pumpkin become the dominant flavours with some sweet toffee and light spices as complementary flavours. As the brew passes the tongue, raisins and nuts manifest as the dry baked pumpkin/carrot bread erupts. Hopsy bitterness amplifies the dryness and well complements the other flavours. Alcohol also becomes slightly apparent. In the finish the bitterness fades rather quickly. It takes a short while for the pumpkin bread flavours to fade. Thereafter, youre left with a dryness and strange numbness on the roof of your mouth. I like this kind of finish a lot, it saves me from having to keep resetting my palate with crackers.

It was very well balanced though between the spice and the sweet malts which gave it the edge over other pumpkin ales. Nice smooth and creamy finish as well. Full bodied and low carbonation.

Aroma is first pumpkin, followed by nutmeg and cinnamon.  Flavor follows the same pattern, big pumpkin taste with pie spices and a touch of caramel malt playing a secondary role.  Its nearly the opposite of many ""pumpkin"" brews, which tend to be all spice. Also not as sweet as some. Alcohol is well hidden to the point of being close to undetectable.

Full-bodied; Super chewy mouthful with a potent alcohol flavour. Good spice throughout with more of the pumpkiny flavours roaming long with a ton of brown sugar and caramalised swetness.

Appearance: The body has a medium amber color with good clarity. Its head is slightly off white in color, about average in size and quickly settles down to a thin covering of bubbles. 

Smell: It has a sweet and creamy pumpkin pie-filling aroma with hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin and malt.

Taste/Mouth feel: The flavor of sweet and creamy mashed pumpkin jumps out on the tongue. Nutmeg and cinnamon are noticeable and is in perfect balance for me. Underneath there is a good layer of doughy and sweet malt with some hints of spicy hops in the finish. It has a rich, medium to full body with a creamy smooth texture and soft carbonation.

Honest to God, this smells like a pumpkin pie. The initial taste is pumpkin, rum-like alcohol, brown sugar, and slightly herbal followed by caramel malt, rum, a somewhat more vegetal pumpkin flavor that is a little more rough than in the aroma, and spice. Alcohol warmth, maybe a little too hot, at the finish. A residual sweetness at the end that doesn’t seem out of place.

The first taste is like a punch on the throat!  A huge, over-bearing wallop of cinnamon completely dominates the flavor.  The second taste shows no mercy either.  I’ll say that this is the most aggressive pumpkin(g) beer I’ve had.  The body is medium and the finish is warm and sugary.

82,"2008-09-15",3.5,"A standard pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces an almost two-finger thick, frothy, light tan colored head.  The beer is a light amber / dark copper color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright copper hue when held up to the light.  Lots of clean caramelized, sweet malt notes add an almost butterscotch note.  This is nicely lacking in the typically lame over-spiced pumpkin-pie spice blend.  Aromas similar to vanilla, toasted cotton candy, .  The aroma is incredibly distinct and quite sweet I would not have guessed that pumpkin would add these butterscotch / caramelized notes, but they are quite different from anything I have ever gotten from malt.  While this does smell fairly sweet there is a significant, equally competing, toasted malt note that adds a ton of biscuit malt character.

Lightly sweet compared to what the aroma might have suggested, though this still ends up being quite sweet and at times a touch cloying.  This does have a medium fullness to it that coats the palate a bit after each sip.  The finish has a touch of hot alcohol to it as well as a lingering toasted cotton candy like note that gets more like toasted grain as the finish lingers on in the palate.  An interesting, sort of fruity, butterscotch-sort-of flavor plays a significant role here and has a soft vanilla like edge to it.  As the beer warms, the significant, toasty grain notes starts to take on a nutty flavor.

This is a very interesting take on the style, I really, really like that the spices seem to have been left out of this beer entirely (or at least used differently than typical); the pumpkin character though is quite a bit different than I was expecting and not in a bad way.  This definitely comes off as a bit cloying (which is typical of this brewery), though I now expect to get dessert when I crack one of this breweries beer open.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Nice clear amber pour with a great (not overly building) off-white head that holds well and left some nice lace - nice density to it too.  Smells great if you like pumpkins and spice - nice mellow but full pumpkin flavor with some great cinnamon and doughy bready notes - smells like fall and thanksgiving.  Wow, the taste is just as good, this thing is delicious and exactly what I would want a pumpkin beer to taste like - rich thought not overwhelming or syrupy; not overly sweet but some nice sweetness to compliment the pumpkin and dough characters; no funky bitterness or any flaws on the finish.  This thing is smooth on the palate with subtle carbonation and a medium to heavy body.  I usually only give 5s on my palate rating to super thick and heavy and coating brews with soft silky carbonation, but this mouth feel is so perfectly suited to the flavor that it is literally perfect.  Overall: this thing is unbelievable if the idea of a pumpkin beer appeals to you.  It tastes like an amazing dessert.  This far surpassed all I was hoping for.  My only real discrepancy is that a bomber might be too much, maybe just a 12 ounce or a pint because it is so rich.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

The pour was fine, though initially I’ll admit, I swigged a few swallows from the bottle.  Once I did pour some: lightish amber, dark yellow in color, decent whitish head.  Aroma was *mildly* of pumpkin, (pumpkin-esque?) and  a lot of some hard to place spice, sort of perfumy.  

Overall flavor ... ugh, is that cardamom?  Hand soap?  Tasting revealed such an utter lack of any true pumpkin taste I had to double check the bottle.  Zero taste of any cinnamon, allspice or ginger whatsoever.  

Sweetness was marred by an almost overpowering, perfumed, spiced-but-not-pumpkin-spiced flavor.  Double checked the bottle again, yep.

Pours a clear orange with a small soapy head. Aroma of warm pumpkin pie filling, nutmeg, cloves, spices, butterscotch. Flavor is pumpkin,nutmeg,cloves, spices.

I’m almost afraid to taste it because I don’t want to be disappointed.  Ok.....drinking it.  The taste definetely focuses on the crust of the pie, and also the pumpkin and spices.  There is a hint of alcohol and hoppiness, that is wish was even more pushed into the background.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"

Up front, I am not and have not been a huge fan of spicey/pimpkin beers, but this one was so spot on that even I loved it. Looks, smells, and tastes just like pumpkin pie, seriously.

82,"2008-09-02",3.9,"#1400.  Tasted 9/2/08.  22oz bomber.  First pour is relatively clear with an orange, amber golden hue.  Sparse off-white head.  Wow!  this is a total pumpkin pie aroma.  i’ve heard of brewers using canned pumpkin in their batches, but this is personified.  But it’s the whole deal, spices, crust and filling.  Crazy nose.  Full bodied and damn fina.  Lotta spice and character, but something odd stands out.  Metallic from the chill?  Odd spicing?  There’s something that just holds this one back a little...Sticky, lingering finish.  Subtle hop character and the alcohol is also rather well masked.  Slight buttery undertone.  Sticky and crisp.  For as smooth as it is, the bitter character rears its head and kinda ruins the roll.  This is definitely the biggest pumpkin I’ve ever had, but not my favorite.  Sticky cloying finsih.  Second and final pour is rather more heady and dissipating.  Same character.  More slight esters are shining underneath the spices.  Cherry raspberry and tart cranberry nuances.  The spices overwhelm the palate, but a lot shows up on the proximity.  Toasty cookie malt character.  Rather sticky finish.  Lingering and cloying.  It’s almost as if the palate is not as much, if not accompanied by the aroma, which is substantial.  This si good, but not as good as my hometown hero, Schlafly!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"

Aroma of pumpkin pie filling, a touch of cinnamon, nutmeg, light sugar and caramel malt, Flavor is full bodied, very lightly carbonated with flavors of mostly pumpkin unlike all the other pumpkin ales I’ve tried over the years. More pumpkin flavor than any other flavors of caramel malt, and nutmeg. Finish has a semi-sweet aftertaste of pumpkin, a touch of wintergreen and nutmeg. Awesome.

82,"2008-08-30",4.4,"(bottle) Pours amber with a lingering white head.  Upon first sniffing of this beer, all I smelled was a freshly baked pie crust, and none of the pumpkin or spices I expected.  After letting it sit for a couple of minutes, I took another sniff and the crust had been replaced with an amazing pumpkin spice smell of cinnamon and nutmeg, but still none of that baked pumpkin.  After letting the beer breathe some more, the third sniff came all together.  The baked pumpkin was present, the spices, and the crust scents all coalesced into one big aroma of freshly baked pumpkin pie.  I even smelled the whipped cream topping as well.  Now as amazing as the aroma is, the flavor was not as pronounced to begin with.  The components are all there, with a light sweetness (which becomes stronger as the beer warms) to begin things, but it is not until the finish that the baked pumpkin, the crust, whipped cream, and the spices really showed up.  The flavors are slightly stronger and begin to be displayed earlier as the beer warms which is a welcome improvement.  Medium mouthfeel with a lingering baked pumpkin finish.  This beer has definitely reached the pumpkin ale pinnacle for aroma, as I cannot think of another that smells so closely to pumpkin pie.  The flavor is its only weakpoint in my opinion, as the boldness displayed in the aroma didn’t directly translate over, but still a very well done beer, and one I will gladly purchase again.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
82,"2008-08-30",4.1,"Copper color with no head.  Incredible roasted pumpkin aroma.  Wow.  Unbelieveable pumpkin taste.

I can smell the crunchy crust, the spices, the whipped cream - everything! Tasty is creamy malts, spices, pumpkin pie, whipped cream, some brown sugar, and light toffee. Very tasty - downright delicious! Body is creamy and smooth but has a bordering on strong carbonation. Lots of burping with this though it’s not as strong, bubble-wise on the palate.

Notes of massive cinnamon, nutmeg, PUMPKIN, and creme fresh all noted...I don’t think I’ve ever smelled something like this before, it’s even more rich than a true piece of pumpkin pie.  I was expecting this to be very sweet in the taste as well, but I was wrong...fairly crisp start with a very natural pumpkin taste that also has the cinnamon, nutmeg and creme notes their to back it up.

82,"2008-08-29",3.9,"Bottle, goblet.  Pours a hazy orange, scanty head, but sparkling.  Aroma, wow, this really is pumpkin pie in a glass.  Pumpkin, caramel, vanilla, nutmeg, something earthy evokes walnuts.  First impressions on the tongue, much the same, plus more spices, orange zest and ginger.  Earthy-sweet.  Nice sparkles on the tongue.  The alcohol cant be tasted, but it certainly is felt, and fast.  I dont know whether the beer gives up its more subtle flavors more quickly than most, or whether the alcohol has just anesthetized my palate, but halfway through the glass, its a much simpler beer, mostly pumpkin and caramel, but its still nice, and still has a nice nose long after most beers aroma would have faded.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"

Aroma is very strong of pumpkins with a hint of vanilla and smells very similar to  ginger bread.  Flavor begins with the warm feeling of the alcohol mixed with the pumpkin taste.  When this subsides, your left with the ginger bread flavor lingering with a bit of a bitter bite at the very end.   Mouth feel is medium and is perfect for the beer.  This beer is one of the better ""halloween"" beers I have tried in a long time and does what very well at what its aimed for, tasting like fall.

Pours yellowish orange with low carb and minimal head.  Smells really nice fall, candied earth, pumpkin, vanilla like, warm smell.  Taste is of sweetness and pumpkin, without any hearty nutmeg or cinnamon flavors to balance it.  Taste more of a pumpkin ice cream or pudding than a pie.

Very, very spicy nose with some citrus and artificial pumpkin coming through.  Body follows suit with very sweet pumpkin, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg standing out.  Did I say this was sweet?  Also offers some very weird, aloe, soap, sunblock type flavors that I really didnt care for.  Hides the alcohol well, but is heavy on the palate.

Finish shows some bitterness, but the memorable note is really just long lasting pumpkin on the tongue.  The body is well balanced and showcases the pumpkin nicely if thats your thing.  Alcohol kick is deceptive and well hidden.  If you like being pummeled by pumpkin in your beer, you’ll love this one.  The quality is there, but this beer is just overwhelming with a flavor that I don’t care for.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

I promised a rerate and nearly 3 years later here it is. Bomber from a couple of friends for my birthday. Thanks! A couple of the finest people I know, and Im not saying that because they gave me beer. Pours a clear amber color with a medium sized creamy offwhite head. Below average head retention.

It starts of with the same character as the flavor, but the linger is odd flavor is a killer.  Its kind of medicinal.  Medium body, dancing carbonation are great.  Again, the aftertaste is a killer.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"

An amazing pumpkin pie aroma, full of fresh cut pumpkin, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Taste is malty sweet, yet not cloyingly so, with lots of cinnamon, pumpkin. This was such a smooth drinking pumpkin beer with an exceptional taste that keeps you coming back for more.

Vanilla, spice, some etoh, loads of pumpkin pie, cream and a hint a vanilla which almost reminds you of the whipped cream.  Im gonna have to rerate this when i take a bomber to my head, but for the small sample its pretty awesome.

Ive been sitting on this one for a few months, and decided to crack it with an unseasonal dip in the temperature this evening. Looks nice, with some amber glowing, well carbonated goodness. Smells interesting, with a trace of butter (I swear, my first thought was microwaved popcorn) but definitely the guts of the pumpkin in there. Wow, this is pretty unforgiving in the pumpkin area isnt it? Its hardcore, and I can practically sense the piles of goop and seeds around me on old newspaper. Nice spices and malts are in there, along with peppery hops, and it redeems what might have otherwise been a one-dimensional beer.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

With the high alcohol content I was surprised that no alcohol was really all that noticable.  You cant complain with the lack of pumpkin in this one.  It became way too much at times making it a bit on the difficult side to drink.

The body is sticky and fairly thick. I would like something to balance out the strong nutmeg spice. Basically, this beer is tasted in only two dimensions.

Somewhat disappointing on the lack of head or lace.  Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, cereal, straw, biscuit), average hops (grass, herbs), average yeast (dough, leaves) with notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and brown sugar.  There is an interesting mix of lightly buttered biscuits and sugar cookies that permeates above all the typical ""pumpkin beer"" spices that is rather intriguing and inviting in a raw dough kind of way.  The pumpkin is not too much nor too little yet is much more present than most pumpkin beers.  Medium bodied, aided by the uncharacteristically high alcohol content, alcoholic texture, average carbonation that fizzles away rapidly, and a chalky yet dry finish.  Long duration, moderate sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.  I am quite taken by this pumpkin beer as it seems to nail the one thing others cannot - it gives the pumpkin flavor along with spices (typical) but also adds a freshly baked crust to the aroma and flavor.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

My first though on the nose was that it smelled exactly like Old Bay.  Its really a  mix of pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon I suppose, but once Old Bay hit me, I couldnt smell anything but.  Funny, the label lists the ingredients, but doesnt mention any spices at all.  Lots of caramel and brown sugar sweetness from the malt.  The flavor is really different for a pumpkin beer.  Im getting lots of sweet malt and a toasted marshmallow middle fading to a vanilla laced pumpkin meat finish.  Just a little bit of citrusy hops peeking past all the spice.  Thankfully its not just pie spice overload.  The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and chewy but not sticky or cloyingly sweet.  The carbonation is a little too overactive for me, but that just seems to be a Southern Tier thing Ive noticed.

This beer has the most real pumpkin smell Ive had in a beer.  An interesting deep caramelization and candied pecans or hickory nuts.  Some sort of spice that Im unfamiliar with.  I could sit and smell this one for hours.  The flavor is quite spicy but with this one I think its more dominated by spicy hops and cardamom, star anise, and Chinese five spice.

Thanks to miketd for cracking this open at the beginning of the tasting. Wed gotten there a little early to break open the heavy hitters but this was not bad at all.  It is one of the better pumpkin beers I have tried this year.  Hopefully it makes a return next fall.
Aroma / Appearance - The clear orange body was mostly translucent but affected everything coming through.  A white half finger head was a stark contrast.  Spices, oranges and cloves reminded me of a pumpkin spiked Belgian.  Closing my eyes it was easy to imagine a hot slice of pumpkin pie with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top.
Flavor / Palate - Whipped cream, mulled spices and pumpkin pie were the strongest flavors but lurking in the back was a bit of nutmeg and other spices.  For a pumpkin ale it had a very full body and mouthfeel.  The spiciness was more evident towards the end of the glass yet still not overpowering.  This is a nice example of the style.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

82,"2007-11-06",2.5,"Draught tulip at Sunset Grill on 10/13/07Clear, straw and light-maize golden with some amber tints.  Yellow-beige head is small, leaving a light layer atop the liquid, with little/no lacing.Ack!  It smells absolutely awful when its first poured.  A strong mix of vegetables, alcohol, vanilla and earth...Sweet, sort of, with vanilla cake-like sugars and lots of allspice.  Moderate amounts of pumpkin emerge, though combined with the raw sugar notes, it dosent smell all that authentic.  Something interesting comes of it, though, upon letting it breath, as this strange mix of veggie-spice-earthiness unfolds in to more of a deep earthy, crusty white bread nose that continues to put forth vanilla, but does begin to round somewhat, working the vanilla, sweet, crusty bread and spice in to more of a harmonious mix.  Unfortunately, as it warms, sharp, grainy alcohol notes are very present on the finish, cutting the aroma short and mixing with the spices to overpower the senses.  Medium-high strength of aroma, some flaws it seems, and definitely some alcohol.A very, very grainy, sharp, raw texture to the beer, almost like oat bran or perhaps ""fibrous"" would be a good word (or as Rastacouere aptly puts it, ""floury"").  Certainly not supple or soft, and with the alcohol burning through on the finish.  Vanilla casts itself over everything, giving a table-sugar-like sweetness to the beer.  Only moderate doses of pumpkin, with tempered allspice are able to provide a relief from all of the negative qualities.  Earthy, crusty bread notes linger on the finish, and some sticky caramel is notable as well.  Like most things Southern Tier does, its got way too much alcohol and a stripped-out texture that cuts at the palate.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Similar flavor, but with a bit more caramel and toasted malt flavor and more subtle spicing.  Still pumpkiny.  Finishes with pumpkin and fades gently.  Fairly substantial mouthfeel compared to other pumpkin beers, but its not creamy and enveloping enough.  Kinda hot.  Pretty nice!

82,"2007-10-31",4.1,"Bottle: Pours deep orange with near perfect clarity. The dense, creamy tan head fades quickly, leaving a film. One of the most outstanding aromas in beer. Literal pie crust aroma! It smells like a kitchen which has been used to bake pumpkin pies all day! Intensely realistic pumpkin pie character, with spices varying from allspice, clove, cinnamon, squash, pie crust, oatmeal cookies and even more festive, holiday oriented aromas. Slick texture, not cloying at all. Flavor is not as euphoric as the aroma, but its still very tasty. Has a great spiciness to it, balancing out the sweet pumpkin pie background. Theres also a vanilla-like character, along with a subtle herbal presence. The spice scale has a great depth, giving this beer its rich, realistic quality. Notes of cinnamon, ginger snap, nutmeg, allspice and clove, all evident in the long, appetizing finish. An outstanding pumpkin beer that, out of what Ive tasted, captures pumpkin pie character most accurately.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Incredible pumpkin pie crust aroma with plenty of pumpkin, almost asian white gourd drink flavor along with spices of clove, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger.  Unlike many  pumpkin ales the beer does not over-rely on cinnamon for flavor.  Caramel malt with little hops.  But the typical beer ingredients are superseeded by the pumkin pie crust/pumkin bread flavor.  Spices compliment, but then cut off the remaining flavors leaving a spicy finish that quells the tongue; making multiple glasses undesired.  Medium to full bodied.  Not perfect, but perhaps the best pumpkin ale.","USA","pforei"

82,"2007-10-30",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2008 light orange-brown appearance.  nose is sweet with a mixture of ginger and hops.  the flavor is almost too unique for me to comment on.  a yeasty initial flavor with a component of raw pumpkin and again heavy on the ginger and also a strong nutmeg component.  so incredibly different that it commands your attention, but I dont really know what to think.  a quality ale nonetheless","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","joshwilfong"
82,"2007-10-30",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
A biscuity pie crust propels atmospheric spices delivering plenty of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin seeds (amongst others) to the increasingly salivating palate. Unique and intense, this strong Pumpkin Ale manages to remain approachable once tasted, assuring a quenching experience within the multisensorial barrage.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thin veil of foam barely covers the clear golden amber.
-The aroma on this one alone could entertain pumpkin pie fans for hours.
-Alcohol is not too evident in the flavor profile.
-The body is lean and clean, perhaps too much so for the decadence announced in the aroma. Then again, it is much more drinkable than what is purported by the enticing spice perfume.
-Whether you like it or not, this should be quite the memorable pumpkin ale.

82,"2007-10-29",4.0,"Bottle from SL, oh and what a pleaser! The pour was clear orange in color, thin little head, splotchy lacing, decent looking, but far better in aroma and flavor. The aroma was wondeful pumpkin pie in a bottle, by far the best aroma to come from a pumpkin anything: graham pie crust, whip cream on top, spicey pumpkin pie base, slight sweetness, yet spicey zingy enough to keep from anything cloying. The flavor followed the aroma, good maltiness underneath: bread and graham crust. Mouthfeel finished with a little bit of acidity, but quite thin overall for the beer that this is. I have a newfound passion to return to some pumpkin beers this year, as a few last year or two have turned me off to the style.","","User37895"
82,"2007-10-29",4.1,"THOUGHTS: I noticed that someone said that this smells like Capn Crunch and it does. Some penut butter cookies too. A really good beer and a great pumpkin beer. Finally Ive tried a pumpkin ale on par or better than Weyerbacher Imperial Pumkin Stout. Went down easy. Hides alcohole increadibly well.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, medium orangey amber with a small, orr-white head that fully diminished and left virtually no lacing. The aroma was heavy cookie, cereal and caramel malts, allspice and a bunch of nutmeg. It actually smelled a little like egg nog. The initial flavor was lightly sweet,  while the finish was moderate to heavy sweetness with a short to average finish. It tasted slightly like Capn Crunch and egg nog. There was also cereal malt, but mostly nutmeg, not straight pumkin pie like most. The medium to full body was Oily to dry with tingly carbonation and spiced but smooth finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

This brew poured a crystal clear, filtered, orange hue with a small beige head that quickly dissolved into a thin layer of scattered bubbles.  Some very faint lacing was left behind.  The aroma of the beer was made up of pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon...pretty much a whole pumpkin pie.  Excellent!!  The flavor consisted of gingerbread, cream, pumpkin, and nutmeg...along with some underlying caramel malt notes and a touch of alcohol.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied with very light carbonation and a lightly warming alcoholic finish.  What else can be said?  Simply, pumpkin pie in a glass!

82,"2007-10-24",4.0,"Draught.  At Coles, Buffalo, NY.  Also had a few times recently in the 22oz bottle.  Clear amber pour, smallish foamy head.  The aroma ... oh, MAN, that aroma.  I sniffed for several minutes before tasting - I tired it in the bottle AFTER the tasting thinking something was unusual, but no, this beer really smells like this - to be specific, it smells EXACTLY like a fresh-from-the-oven pumpkin pie;  up-front the breadiest, truest graham cracker crust with shortening aroma Ive ever smelled not from real baking, plus real pumpkin, strong but not sweet nutmeg and cinnamon (very pungent), and I swear I could smell the dollop of fresh whipped cream on top too - just amazing, I gotta give this 10/10 - pumpkin beer cannot smell better than this.  The taste follows - again, graham crackers, then actual pumpkin filling, and tons of bitterness - hops and the unsweetened spice .... hides that 9% pretty well, but I suspect part of the bitterness is from the booze.  Average body, nice carbonation and of course astringency, long pungent bitter finish - really cleared my Dads sinuses when he tried it.

This beer was delicious, with what tasted a great deal like a very good pumpkin pie with tons of nutmeg, cinnamon, and other spices.  Even the mouthfeel, which was smooth and rich, reminded me of the custard-like texture of pumpkin pie.

The beer poured a rich copper red color with abundant and durable head atop it.  Aroma was fantastic - tons of warm winter-feeling spices, like opening a spice cabinet or entering a spice shop.  Mouthfeel and flavor were as Ive described above, and superlative, particularly for this style.

82,"2007-10-16",4.2,"Imperial Pumking is a shimmering jewel of an ale with excellent clarity.  It is a solid amber with a finger of dust-colored foam that dissipates to a thin, waxing crescent Hunters moon.  It has a juicy and spicy bouquet.  Cassia, biscuits and ginger are looming in the nose.  Earth tones blend with a cherry apple cider deep in the aroma.  Exciting!  It is heavy on the tongue and slick on the mouth.  Its large thin carbonation cant cut through after your tongue is rendered numb.  It feels hot from the alcohol.  Very chewy.  The flavor has pumpkin pie, spicy gingerread, black peppercorns, caroway rye and corriander.  Its almost a touch sweet, like butterscotch.  Its almost hidden by the alcohol.  The alcohol is a bit heavy, but I think its amplified by the huge bitterness.  The aftertaste is like peat and oak... or whisky and bourbon.  Its a huge and demanding flavor!  Yowza!  Nice autumn tones.  It waylays!  This should have a warning label.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

Pumking pours a chill hazed orange that is absolutely glowing. A one finger white head appears on the pour that quickly falls to a thin skimming with a collar. Carbonation appears on the low side with a few streams of tiny bubbles crawling to the surface.

The nose on this beer is amazing. Ive never smelled another beer that so perfectly captures the season as Pumking. Pumpkin along with cinnamon, nutmeg, some brown sugar, and a few other spices I cant put my finger on. Every spice in this beer is so perfectly balanced it becomes one, mouthwatering, entity. Even smells like theres a dollop of whipped cream on top. Unbelievable getting this kind of aroma in a beer.

The mouthfeel is identical to the aroma. The spicing becomes a little bolder but is still perfectly balanced. Cinnamon and nutmeg are the two most prominant but theres other spicing as well, all over the top of that great pumpkin background.

Medium bodied and creamy with sluggish carbonation. The lack of carbonation lets the spices dance through the mouth creating the feel of Autumn.

The drinkability is the only bad thing about this beer. The only reason its a weak point is because of the style and spicing. For a pumpkin beer its the most drinkable Ive ever expierenced but overall the spicing will do a number on you.

I didnt expect this beer to be half this good. One of the best noses on a beer Ive come across in awhile. I cant tell there is one drop of alcohol in this beer and thats saying something for a beer so big. I could drink these all throughout the Fall and Winter. Southern Tier does not disappoint.

Huge aroma of fresh pumpkin pie, cinnamon, bread, flaky crust and cool whip. How is this not a slice of pumpkin pie? Sure smells like one. Wow, awesome flavor. Its like drinking a flesh baked pumpkin pie with home made vanilla enhanced whipping cream. Wow, just plain yummy.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
82,"2007-10-11",4.0,"Pours an amber color with an off-white head.  Aroma is of pumpkin, nuts, nutmeg, and just a hint of alcohol.  Flavor is mostly pumpkin.  Much more pumpkin then any pumpkin ale Ive ever had.  Backround notes of nutmeg, nuts, and finishes with a little alcohol warming.  Its like eating pumpkin pie and getting drunk at the same time.  Delicious.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Lowe1983"
82,"2007-10-10",3.0,"(22oz bottle) Small off-white head diminishes quickly, crystal clear amber body.  Aroma is not especially strong, medium sweet, ginger/allspice, light clove.  Taste is medium sweet, pumpkin pie, light allspice. Fair amount of alcohol evident, though its presence becomes more muted as the beer approaches room temperature  For that matter, the beer as a whole kept improving as it warmed, peaking at room temperature.  Smooth medium-full body.  From my perspective, the high alcohol doesnt enhance pumpkin beers, as I dont think too highly of Weyerbachers either.  Final score is a composite of consuming the bottle as it warmed from 52F to room temperature (71F) -- the lower temp would have scored worse, and the higher temp would have rated higher.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
82,"2007-10-09",3.7,"22oz - Aroma of bready pie crust, nutmeg and pumpkin pie filling.  Pours clear brown with a small head and decent lacing.  Flavor matches aroma.

The closest thing to pumpkin pie in a bottle Ive ever had.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","MI2CA"
82,"2007-10-09",3.9,"Pumking had two aromas; first on when I popped the bomber was allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon and then a roasted pumpkin when poured into a glass.   Appearance is a clear orange body, and some lacing of the thin head.   The pumpkin flavor is outright and blends well with the 2 row malt.   However, the pumpkin musk  began to turn me off at the end of the bomber.   Well done NY craft brewed pumpkin beer.  Drink a few bottles of Pumking and youll need a ride home from Puca.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
82,"2007-10-08",3.7,"Tap at the Brickskeller.  Pour of bright amber, slightly misty.  Aroma is a pure essence of pumpkin flesh and roasted, salted seeds.  Almond creme frosting and cinnamon whipped cream fill in the rich back end.  Lively and luxurious pie flavor with orange and alcohol infusions.  Not ridden with subtleties, to be sure, but whats there is quite lovely.  Hints of caraway kraut and cardamom dry it out a bit toward the finish, where alchohol sterilizes the mouth swiftly.  Smooth and medium to full body, alcohol being felt in the texture, but not tasted necessarily.  Well constructed and carefully executed, this would be brilliant with a kind of robust porter base.  As is, very enjoyable and easy to drink.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
82,"2007-10-08",3.1,"Draft at the Brickskeller. Clear amber body with a small white head. The aroma is very sweet with lots of pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon.

Just too sweet for my tastes.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"

VERY interesting brew (and Im not a pumpkin pie fan), its like spices and pumpkin pie blended nicely together in a glass.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mabel"
82,"2007-10-06",3.6,"Slight orange colour with a bit of an offwhite head. The aroma is laregly pumpkin with some spice, like pumpkin pie mix before baking.

Phenolic taste is prevelant. Brown sugar finish to it. Medium mouthfeel, decent body. Too phenolic for my liking.","","Cobra"

82,"2007-10-05",4.4,"Courtesy of Degarth. Pours a glowing orange body with a small, quickly receding white head. One of the best noses I have ever experienced on a beer. A good friend said it best when he said this is the Belgian Red of pumpkin beers. Really cant argue or explain it any better than that. HUGE aroma of pumpkin pie, pumpkin seeds and flesh, nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. Also get some sweet cream at the very end. The flavor is just as good - all of the above with the sweet creaminess expanded upon. Palate is creamy and full bodied; sticky mouthfeel. Finish is extremely lengthy. Medium carbonation. Outstanding beer.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"
82,"2007-10-05",4.0,"Smells just like pumpkin pie. Pours clear orange with a white diminishing head. Flavor matches the aroma.

82,"2007-10-05",4.1,"This is best seasonal beer Ive ever had.  From bottle poured to pint glass.  Look is a great orangy-dark amber with a little bit of a white head.  Hits the nose like Grandmas pumpkin pie.  Smooth on the intake with strong pumpkin pulp and nutmeggish flavors that linger and hide the alcohol well.

82,"2007-10-04",3.0,"Bottle and served in pint glass: Clean deep golden hue with a small frothy head and very good lace. The aroma is a wonderful combination of meaty pumpkin flesh, nutmeg, allspice, clove, pie crust, maple syrup, and butter. The taste has pumpkin up front and it stays there and ends up overpowering. Spicy, bready, nutty and herbal are things also found on the palate. The mouth feel is aggressive due to the spice but smooth with the carbonation. While good and flavorful, it got to be too much. I think this is one beer that would be better served colder.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

The aroma is an exact mimicker of pumpkin pie. You can actually smell the pumpkin, brown sugar, whipped cream, butter, and warm flaky crust. There was also a dash of cinnamon. Amazing. Sweet on the tongue, but not cloyingly so. Tastes very similar to a pumpkin pie as well, but with a nice warm splash of alcohol. The only thing missing was a dollop of vanilla ice cream. This is an unbelievably good beer, not just a good pumpkin beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

Room temp brings out further waves of brown sugar, and hints of caramel cream. Fleshy pumpkin flavor is very well balanced on the cinnamon gingery, and nutmeg notes. Could truly taste liquid pumpkin pie, crust and all. This comes off only lightly sweet as the pumpkin puree and spice keeps it all in check.  ABV is expertly hidden.

82,"2007-09-30",3.8,"Bottle. Aroma is almost pumpkin, in fact more pumpkin than any pumpkin brew I can remember. However, it is more like Captain Crunch cereal than pumpkin. Really. If you blindfolded me and put a bowl of Captain Crunch under my nose and then a glass of Southern Tier Pumpking, Im not sure Id be able to tell which is which. Nevertheless, I have to give ST credit for nearly nailing the pumpkin aroma. There is no high alcohol presence in the nose. Truly unique. Hazy amber with slow and steady carbonation. Mostly white head, thin but lasting. Flavor IS pumpkin pie. Alcohol is subdued. Wow, they really nailed it. I need to get some more of this and share it at the family Thanksgiving festivities.

It has a very pleasant maltiness in the aroma, but nicely paired with the perfect amount of cinnamon and gingerbread cookies.  The cookie-dough quality carries over into the flavor.  It is somewhat sweet, but not too much so.  I really like the spicy, yet pastry-like finish.  It leaves you with a warming cinnamon taste.  Nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"

Easy to drink.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
82,"2007-09-29",4.1,"A thick and semi-oily apearance, body of deep gold with leanings towards Autumnal orange. A thin white head is slowly but not quite fully diminishing. The aroma is almost perfect! I never expected to smell anything remotely like this in a pumpkin beer....or any food product at all, other than the toasted pumpkin seeds this so closely resembles. Pumpkin flesh is prevalent, in lieu of massive spicing, and while spicing isnt overdone its very, very complimentary, perfectly measured and employed. Nutmeg is the heaviest of the spices, followed by very light allspice. cinnamon, ground clove and cardamom. I have never(!!!!) experienced so much glorious pumpkin aromas in a beer, it is just shocking. Heavily buttered and salty, toasted and bready grains and malts collide with pumpkin pie and freshly whipped cream notes. I could nose this for hours and never grow bored. Gingerbread, mild caramel and modest alcohol considering the amount actually present are noted as well. The flavor isnt quite as exciting, but its no slacker either. Alcohol warmth is mild and shielded from a serious attack by wave after tall wave of toasted pumpkin. Sweetness is medium and balanced beautifully. Bitterness is low, as is astringency. Spicing is a touch more evident but never overzealous, allspice is dominant. Very light hops. Nutty caramel malt is stitched into the flavor with a cunning exploitation of fresh pumpkin and multiple fresh spices. This is so easily the best pumpkin beer Ive ever had. The finish is spicy, mostly cinnamon and nutmeg, pumpkin and toast lingering for what seems like an eternity. The mouthfeel is medium to medium-full bodied, slick, only lightly sticky, well carbonated and a pleasure from start to finish. Simply incredible, a beer that I will be giving to everyone I can so that they can taste something this magnificent this Halloween, and throughout the holidays.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
82,"2007-09-29",4.3,"Courtesy of Boboski!!!  This beer pours the color of Fall, a beautiful and rich orange color.  The aroma, OH MY GOD THE AROMA!!!  This is insanely wonderful.  Roasted pumpkin, pumpkin seeds, gingerbread, some slight toffee notes.  Arguably one the greates aromas I have encountered.  Can the flavor compare?  It does, it tastes remarkably similar to the aroma.  There is an awesome nuttiness that only serves to enahnce the pumpkin dominance.  Could not detect the alcohol at all.  Absolutely amazing!!!!","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
82,"2007-09-29",4.3,"Smells just like pumpkin pie. Color is amber/pumpkin with a tan, lingering head.

Huge pumpkin aroma, with some cinnamon and pumpkin spice in there too.  Maybe the most pumpkin Ive ever smelled in a nose.  Toasted pumpkin seeds is what comes to mind here.  Creamy smelling and rich.  Huge pumpkin flavor as well.  Pretty much tastes like it smells.  Fantastic creamy blend of pumpkin and cinnamon spice although the pumpkin is seemingly dominant over the spice.  Just enough to balance it out.  Probably the most enjoyable pumpkin Ive had to date.

82,"2007-09-28",1.8,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2011 On tap at the Trivia Pub. Clear ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color and appearance.  Pretty thick bubbly head. Very spicy aroma of spiced pumpkin pie of course. The taste is; oh yes, lots of pumpkin, more than I have ever tasted in a pumpkin beer before. Oh yes, oh yes, pumpkin flavors galore. This is welcomed because so many pumpkin beers Ive tasted have had pumpkin spice but not much pumpkin. However, the strong alky impact of this imperial beer is a little too much for my girlie taste buds. The oppressiveness of the brew makes it at times difficult to enjoy, certainly on the imperial level at 9%!  Has some decent carbonation for a tingle. Finish is like pumpkin pie and whiskey, whew.  Bitter lingering alky malt finish that hangs for a while after the session.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

That buttery flavor is even more pronounced in the flavor.  My initial response is that this is awesome, but I think it might be a little cloying.  that 9% is totally concealed.  This is probably my favorite fall seasonal ever.

There is a moderate pumpkin backbone with some light caramel.  This has more actual pumpkin flavor than any other pumpkin beer Ive had.  The finish has a nice cinnamon and clove character that lingers on the palate.  Alcohol is nonexistent in the aroma and flavor.  Medium-full bodied with an slick oily texture with mild carbonation.

That is one pumpkin tasting beer.  Malty pumpkin is the dominant flavor and I am not referencing spice.

It’s there though. So too are the spices- way overboard, and a unique combonation of brown sugar, nutmeg, cinn. etc. Wow! bottle re-rate- 09/22/08- disappointed with this year’s batch- a little overly spiced, and a little vegetal without so much of the graham flavor I loved before.

The first things I smell are fresh snickerdoodle cookies and pumpkin.  Lots of spices--cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg are what I can pick out.  I got a hint of orange hard candy in there as well.  Flavor mimics the aroma with more bready cookie notes and some caramel malt.  Finishes drier than Id have thought.  9% ABV?  Masked pretty well, as I only got a light tingle on the tongue from it.

82,"2007-09-23",3.9,"Not to sound trite, but this is the best pumpkin beer I have ever tasted.  Smell is nose shattering with smell and taste of a pumkin pie, with nutmeg, vanilla, and ginger.  Hides the alcohol very well.  Excellent beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","taffurs888"
82,"2007-09-23",3.7,"Sampled with Stegosaurus during our second Boston Tour. Served at Sunset Grill.  Orange pour with sweet aroma, cinnamon, nut and other spices. Sweet spice/ brown sugar taste. This was actually pretty good.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","MadIndian"
82,"2007-09-23",3.8,"If you are looking for liquid pumpkin pie, go out and buy this beer today!  As a longtime pumpkin beer drinker, never quite had one like this.  Strong, strong, nutmeg flavor, with solid pumpkin notes.  If this is the flavor you like, its well done, no question about it.  I, however, found the spicy taste and aromas slightly overdone.  Nevertheless, still a very fine brew.","Flintstone, Maryland, USA","zywiecporter"
82,"2007-09-22",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2012 Rerate on 09/03/2012.  The BEST goddam pumpkin ale I have ever had period.  The color is a nice but unremarkable copper.  The aroma is outstanding, like pumpkin pie in a glass.  Immediate notes of baked bread/pie, malty, with a little spiciness.  The flavor has the right amount of pumpkin, spices and maltiness.  Smooth finish, leaves some sweetness on the plate.  Nice thick mouth feel.  Something I look forward to every fall.  Excellent.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
82,"2007-09-22",4.0,"POurs dark orange with deep notes of pumkin and the associated spices.  This os one of the few that actually get it right by combining all of the flavors from the pumpkin to the spices and actually balance them all out.

82,"2007-09-21",3.8,"Most pumkin pie like beer yet.  From the whip creme topping to the orange filling. Slight whtie head with copper color. Fits a great pumkin beer profile","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Dough77"
82,"2007-09-20",3.9,"Bottle at our Septoberfest party. This beer is a clear dark copper color with a medium off-white head with decent retention. Patchy lacing. Aroma of pumpkin pie and allspice. Medium-bodied with a very nice pumpkin flavor. So many pumpkin beers seem to veer too far into the spice side but this one has a very good pumpkin pie and caramel malt flavor with touches of ginger and allspice. The finish is sweetly spiced and completes the ""liquid pumpkin pie"" equation. Well done overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
82,"2007-09-19",2.8,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2009 Draft at Quotations in Media, PA. Clear orange color with a medium to large head. Good lacing. Tastes the most like a pumpkin pie of all the pumpkin beers Ive tried. Its really too much, in my opinion.
 A lot of cinnamon and pumpkin. You can even taste the heavy pie crust. It tastes fattening. Not my favorite, by far.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","MrBendo"
82,"2007-09-19",4.1,"Bottle from Capones.  Nice label that reminds me a little of the Weyerbacher concept.  The pour here is chill hazy coppery orange; very Halloweenish color in this, with off-white head.  Aroma is big pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices, slight caramel malt, orange zest, mango, and hops.  I swear I smell candy corn in this, too.  The flavor is caramel malt mixed with subdued yet layered pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices, hops, more orange zest, and a very smooth palate that remains complex throughout.  This is definitely one of the best pumpkin ales I have had thus far, and well worth seeking out.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
82,"2007-09-18",3.6,"Ive long been of the opinion that if youre going to drink a Pumpkin Ale, it may as well be an Imperial Pumpkin Ale.  And here I have one.  From the bottle it makes a striking pour, a crystal clear orange/amber with a hefty ecru head.  Good lacing.  The strong alcohol content gives the aroma an almost liquer-like twist, albeit it contains the usual allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and some squash.  The flavor gives the allusion of sweetness because of all the pumpkin pie spicing, but theres some bready malt and an underlying earthy bitterness that keep the reality in check.  It finishes on a cookie spice finish with just a touch of bitterness.  Pretty decent, but, not being a huge fan of the style, I think that having drunk a bomber will suffice for a while.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

82,"2007-09-17",4.1,"This spiced ale pours a orange color from a 22oz bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is gingerbread, cinnamon, nutmeg, and some pumpkin. Very nice aroma, might be the best smelling beer I have had so far this year.  Medium bodied spiced, vegetable beer. The malts are gingerbread cookie, caramel. some pumpkin. Nice blend of the spices, cinnamon, nutmeg and cinnamon, they are there but in the background. It is really like a slice of pie in a bottle. The start is sweet and it finishes spicy.  Best Pumpkin Ale I have tasted. Hides the 9% alcohol extremely well. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is spicy.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
82,"2007-09-17",3.8,"Bottle: Pours a clear orange color with a big white head. Aroma, graham crackers, cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar. Flavor, graham crackers, brown sugar, lots of pumpkin pie spices, but the actual pumpkin is barely noticable. Its definitely the first beer Ive had that really captures the ""pie in a bottle"" but its a little over the top at times. Still pretty good though.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
82,"2007-09-17",3.4,"22 oz bottle, Jimmack Invitational 2007.  Amber in color.  Aroma has a huge amount of nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin and caramel.  Taste is very spicy, with alot of nutmeg, cinnamon, and is sweet with caramel and pumpkin.  Tastes and smells like fresh pumpkin pie, but it is very overwhelming.  A bit too sweet for my tastes- I can see how people would get into this though.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"

Hops show up late in the finish to cut the sweetness.","Rochester, New York, USA","ElJefe"
82,"2007-09-16",3.2,"Poured a clear orange color into the lager glass.  There was a light beige head and minimal lacing.  The scent was of nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin extract.

A little too sweet for my liking.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"
82,"2007-09-15",4.0,"Bomber.  Light copper color with a minimal off-white head.  Doesnt look like much, but what a nice aroma!  Cinnamon, clove, gingerbread and rice pudding with a liberal sprinkling of nutmeg.  Pumpkin is really an afterthought.  Nice light biscuity malts with pumpkin and spice flavors, and even notes of carrots? I love the overall balance of this- not an overbearing, overspiced heavy pumpkin bomb like some of the others of this style.  All the more surprising as this is ""imperial.""  Even the alcohol is well subdued. Normally, I dont seek out pumpkin beers, but I bought this since there was such a good ""buzz out over it.  Another nicely executed specialty brew from ST.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"

82,"2007-09-15",4.2,"22 oz. bomber.  I was thrilled to go to the bottle shop earlier this week amd see a nice display of pumpkin and oktoberfest beers.  This was one of the first bottles I opened, and what a great choice it was.  Pours a clear orange with a moderate off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Fantastic aroma of fresh pumpkins with light pumpkin pie spices.  It really smells like a fresh piece of pumpkin pie.  The flavor was again very reminiscent of a fresh piece of pumpkin pie, with the spices nailed just right and fresh pumpkin flavor.  A little vanilla detected as well.  The alcohol at 9% was extremely well hidden.  Ill be heading back to the store for more of these for sure.  Yummmmmm!","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

Light alcohol in the finish but overall well hidden. I was really into the fresh pumpkin pie aroma. I also liked the fact that the spices took a back seat.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

Yum.  Taste is even better.  Rich pumpkin puree sweetened with honey and brown sugar.  Sweet buns then some clean, lemon pith drying to bring down the sweetness.  Avoids the bitter spice aftertaste in most Pumpkins.  Something artificial about this but just so tasty.  What a treat.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
82,"2007-09-13",2.4,"Poured a clear copper color with a thin, off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of nuts, vegetal pumpkin, and buttered popcorn jelly beans. Taste was just the same jelly beans as the aroma, vanilla, some yeast, straw, and a dry finish. Perhaps some pumpkin in there as well, and I usually dig the non-spiced pumpkins, this was just weird though.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
82,"2007-09-13",4.0,"Pours a translucent orange with lot of golden notes and a smaller bubbly off white head.  Aroma of wow...pumpkin pie. I have said this with other pumpkin ales, but most go overboard on the spicing. This one smells just like a fresh piece of pumpkin pie sitting in front of me. Also reminded me of the pumpkin pice yankee candle.  The pumpkin is there, the crust, hints of vanilla and light pumpkin pie spices.  Flavors of the same, for 9% alcohol well hidden.  As other noted the pie crust is another thing that comes across in the aroma and flavor that many pumpkin ales miss.  Low hop flavor and bitterness...but enough there to keep it in the beer relm. Not overly sweet either.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
82,"2007-09-12",3.9,"Bottle from Rivers Bend. Poured clear copper color with a large off-white frothy head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Solid doughy pumpkin pie and small alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a creamy texture. Heavy balanced carrot cake flavor with a medium spice sweet finish of long duration. Standout seasonal beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
82,"2007-09-11",3.9,"Now this is a pumpkin beer.  If you want to know what this tastes like, let me put it to you like this:  Yankee Candles Pumpkin Spice candle in a beer form.  The minute you pop the top you are hit with an abundance of pumpkin and spice of which Ive never seen in a pumpkin beer.  This is extremely well done.  I think the only thing that this would need would be some kind of sweetener to balance out the taste a little bit.  The spice is abundant and dominating.  At 9% youre going to feel this one a bit as well.  This would be absolutely wonderful to drink outdoors sitting around a campfire.  My new favorite pumpkin beer without a doubt.  Ill surely be drinking a few more of these.  Well done Southern Tier.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

Flavour is very similar - Spices are dominant - cinnamon? ginger? nutmeg? but more of a blended melange than in the aroma. Spices are well balanced by sweet fruity pumpkin in the background. Spice lingers with just a touch of bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Smooth medium to full bodied palate. (3+) Alcohol is lightly warming but minds its manners.

82,"2007-09-06",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2007 9/052007:  In the tradition of all Southern Tier Imperial beers that have come before this one, Southern Tier Pumking is a BIG beer!  It pours a somewhat tawny golden color with a large, foamy, and long-lasting off-white head than leaves behind nice lacing effects.  It has a sweet and spicy (nutmeg?) aroma with a hint of fresh pumpkin flesh caramelized with some brown sugar and/or honey.  Acutally, this beer smells very much like a freshly baked spice cake made from a boxed mix with even a hint of nut (walnut maybe?) in it as well.  The flavor is initially spicy with more of the fresh lightly caramelized pumpkin flesh.  The aroma is like that of spice cake, but the flavor is just about dead on carrotcake with a bit of nice vegetable-like character and maybe even a bit of seet sour cream frosting mixed in as well!  This medium-bodied beer is smooth and clings to the palate.  Overall this is an interesting and original interpretation of the pumpkin beer style.  Unlike most pumpkin beers that are either way too spicy or nothing but nasty vegetable juice, Southern Tier Pumking is extremely flavorful and well-balanced.  This beer probably takes the #2 slot for my favorite pumpkin beers just behind <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/southampton-pump Pumpkin Ale.

82,"2007-09-06",4.1,"Autumn colored pour, straight pumpkiny orange, small barely any head. Aroma is huge and is pumpkin pie all the way. Flavor is obviously pumpkin pie spice a lots of it, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a big pie crust malt flavor. Hop bitterness in the aftertaste or 9% alcohol bitterness kinda overides some flavors.

Pumpkin, pumpkin pie, squash, crust, cinnamon, burnt newspaper, other spices.  I know its hard to tell the difference between pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice, but there is definitely a strong real pumpkin aroma in this.  Tastes exactly identical to the smell.  9% is nowhere to be found.  Full bodied at first but the finish is a little bit of a letdown.  Thats really the only flaw in this beer.
