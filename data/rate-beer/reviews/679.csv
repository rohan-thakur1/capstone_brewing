Smells of molasses, caramel malts, burned toffee and earth - rustic and inviting.

Has a very low carbonation, silk on the tongue, very sweet till mid palate until the finish, in which a pungent dryness mingles together with the initial maltiness.

Toffee malts with a rustic earth wrapping creates the taste foundation in this. Gets a very pleasant roasty touch during mid palate, enriching the malts, with a slowly evolving herbal note. After the swallow hops get way more noteable, producing an almost tongue numbing dryness of dried grass, replacing the sweetness by even more earthen toast in the finish.

679,"2016-03-08",4.2,"8.5%ABV. Scotch Ale.

Poured out dark brown amber. 18° SRM.

Nose. Roasted nuts and caramel. There are also aromas of port, flan, brandied cherries, rum raisin, Christmas cake or rum cake. There is also a rich and very pleasant spiciness to the nose with nutmeg and cinnamon. 

Palate is highly complex with sweet flavors of molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, manuka honey predominating. There is a nice hop balance to this monster with flavors that are spicy representing Thai basil, cilantro and parsley. 

Overall, this one came onto the palate very much like Mike Myers character, brash, obvious, pushy, a little smelly and breathtakingly crude, but dig a little deeper and you find that its all just a cover for some very fine, genteel and almost painfully subtle sensory experiences.

Poured a bottle of Dirty into a tall thin tulip and got some head. Reddish brown in color and smelling of darker malts, I drank it too cold at first and it was good, but lacking character, so I let it warm up for a while, and as it did, it fell apart into disparate components. It certainly is a complex mix of flavors, which arent Scottish and dont really work well together.

679,"2016-01-15",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2017 Founders Dirty Bastard Scotch Ale 8.5%

As Founders will be imported in 2016 I decided to crack this bottle Beercation hooked me up with. 

In my thistle glass this scotch ale is a dark brown verging on black. Its got a nice malty plum, raisin and dark fruits aroma - rich and savoury.

The taste is rich, malty, nutty, dark pitted fruit with a bit of bitter cocoa and dark chocolate. This is damn good stuff.-----can in 2017 imported----not as nice as my previous review. Id say Im not a fan of that slightly acrid taste. Which would probably drop the Taste down to a 6 or 7.

This scotch style ale is much darker in color than the Ise Kadoya Scotch Ale, a dark opaque brown with a pillowy tan head. 

The aroma is a nutty sweet caramel bread. Medium to light bodied and silky smooth. The taste is a bit a risky bitter dark bread, caramel toffee and mayhaps just a suggestion of nutty notes but nowhere near as strong as the aroma which wasnt all that strong to begin with.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

Rounded, sweet and fruity onset, hint of brown sugar, pear, fig, prunes, accompanied by a subtle sourish touch; soft carbonation, tingling just a little bit, paired with a smooth, velvety, full mouthfeel, deeply malty middle phase, caramelly in a slick and noble way, chocolatey touch, slightly nutty, with a subtle hint of roasted bitterishness in the end, but remaining subdued and not becoming coffee-like; finish also shows leafy and somewhat peppery hop bitterness as well as a fair deal of warming, liqueurish alcohol, which nevertheless stays very subtle and smooth, with only a warming effect and not becoming too astringent at all; the initial sweetness persists as well, but is in perfect balance with the bittering flavours and does not become boring or cloying at all.

Appearance - a nice rusty red color which formed a foaming head which lingered ~ 1 min after pouring.

Smell - Not a very potent odor. Smells of alcohol a bit with a little bit of fruit possibly, but not very strong at all.

Taste - An upfront bitterness that seems to persist. while not heavily present at first, begin to get the alcohol taste a bit later.

Mouthfeel - A nice level of carbonation with an average body.

Overall - Not a bad beer, but not what it is lived up for or costs. Would not buy on any regularity and would choose other Founders beers over this.","","Darkmagus82"

OCZY : Piwo jest ciemne z odcieniami czerwieni i ciepłego brązu. Ma średniej wielkości piane o beżowym kolorze.

NOS : mocne aromaty słodu o lekko podpalanych i dymionych odcieniach. Karmel, toffi i pralinka. Alkohol, wiśnie, suszone śliwki, nugat i pomarańcz. 

USTA : delikatnie gazowane i oleiste. Podobna konsystencja do mleka. 
Piwo jest słodkie o barwach czekolady i suszonych owoców. Te ostatnie nadaje delikatną kwaśność. Ale nie jest cierpka. Piwo ma głęboki i bardzo złożony smak. Pod koniec, wraz z gorzkością, wyłania się delikatny posmak cytrusowego orzeźwienia. Ale i tak gorzkością dominują barwy podpalane, podobne do pestki jabłka i alkoholu. Posmak podobny do suszonych i wędzonych owoców i piernika. 

ODCZUCIA : wreszcie udało mi się dorwać te bardzo znane piwo w świecie craftu amerykańskiego. Jest smaczne i świetnie skomponowane. Przyznam się, ze oczekiwałem czegoś w stylu Arogant Bastard z Stone, który jest również mocno chmielony. Ale i tak jest spoko.

Part of the Founders feature at the LCBO (Backwoods Bastard, Breakfast Stout, Dirty Bastard, Pale Ale, Porter). The beer pours a dark copper colour with a thin ring for a head. The aroma is dark fruits and caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. The flavour is sweet malt, molasses, some smokiness, and fruit.

Herbal hops mix with meaty, savoury notes, nutty malt and berries to create the aroma. A mild berry flavour up front gives way to quite strong hops, which bring in fruity, spicy flavours. There is a rich blend of savoury and nutty malt in a weighty mid-palate. The nutty flavour is joined by dark, slightly sweet berries in the finish. This is a very classy Scotch ale. It is quite well hopped for a beer of this style, which helps, along with its savoury feel, to prevent it from being too sweet.

679,"2013-08-22",3.4,"Into a snifter at just on cellar temperature. Compact and tight dollop of beige cream sets in atop, laces a thin weave. Body is a dull brown in the shadows and hazy but it shimmers a deep russet copper when held to the lights. The carbonation fine and rises sluggishly. Rich, sticky and spicyy aroma dominated by caramelised stonefruits, sultanas, raisins, brandy and toffee brittle. There is a faint waft of heather and peat in there also. First thing I noticed in the taste was the bitter wall it puts up in the rear. Almost a herbal tonic reminiscent of Unterberg aperitif that lasts long in the aftertaste. Body is medium with an oily, resinous mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Medicinal alcohol gives it heat with a touch of brandy, burnt wine that roughens it up. The savoury fruit of the aroma fills it out. Residually sweet with plenty of fruit sugars left like a film on the tongue. Id say a good few years in the bottle will soften the blow of this one, maybe sand off the burrs. A cross between an English and American Barleywine over the Scotch ale listing.

Taste/feel: This is my first scotch ale, and I really quite like it. I thought it would be extremely big, bold, and heavy, but it really isnt. You get some sweet malty flavor at first sip, but a warming on the swallow, as well as a nice, bready aftertaste.

A - Pours a deep, dark red that appears brown when not under direct light. A decent bit of floaties and crud swimming around. Two fingers of dense and creamy light tan foam. Really sticky lacing with long lasting retention. 

S - Toffee, tons of dark fruits, caramel, molasses and a touch of smoke. So much fruitier and sharper than its barrel aged counterpart. Has a strong finish of booze and peat. 

T - Toffee malts and raisins. Sweet caramel, vanilla butterscotch and a light smokey finish. Smoother than the aroma led me to believe. Despite being very flavorful and sweet, the finish is nothing but clean with just a lasting touch of peat. Excellent.

M - Thick and creamy with low carbonation. Frighteningly drinkable.

The beer appears dark brown, with crimson hues evident when held to the light. The beer arrives with a half inch of head that generates some decent lacing as it recedes. The beer is slightly smoky, with a sweet malt character evident in both the aroma and flavor. A subtle roast aspect contributes to the flavor profile, and a surprising hop bitterness in the back adds the finishing touch. The feel is medium bodied, with a healthy level of carbonation. A good, but not great, example of the style. Id drink it again.

679,"2012-04-09",4.3,"A: Pours a very dark tawny color. Head is light cream colored with poor retention, but good lacing.

S: Quite complex smelling. Caramel, toffee, subtle dark fruit, biscuit, smoke, and light hints of nutmeg.

T: Taste follows the nose here, with quite a bit of caramel and biscuit on the opening. Dark fruits enter the picture slightly during the second part, while it has an herbal, green tea-esque finish. The caramel notes actually give it some finishing bitterness, too, along with an additional smoky sweetness on the exhale. Complex and interesting, perhaps a bit too much for its own good; but drinkability is surprisingly high.

M: Im surprised how crisp this finishes, which parallels its dryness very well. The body is a little slender - actually, I cant complain about that, because of how expertly it intertwines with the carbonation (high, but spot on) and the aforementioned finish.

O: Surely, Im no expert on what a wee heavy should taste like - but for what its worth, this is one of the most drinkable high(er) alcohol beers Ive ever had. Its amazing how the complexity doesnt hinder its drinkability, either. Big thumbs up.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

679,"2012-01-26",3.7,"Thanks zielinski. Tasted from bottle into nucleated pint glass. Poured a dark reddish-brown color with no foam, just a small film of beige bubbles. Vigorous swirling kicked up a small, mildly aromatic head which quickly subsided, leaving a little Belgian lace. Smelled a little like caramelized brown sugar, toffee, distant earthy and citrusy hops, light compost and smoke essences. Very hoppy flavor: tart, tangy, bitter orange rind, with a rich malt sweetness masked underneath. Much hoppier than a true-to-style Scotch Ale, but this is a remarkable enhancement. A well-crafted balance which is still reminiscent of a classic, dark and complex style. Medium body. Full, creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation. Long-lasting bittersweet aftertaste. I dont think they barrel-aged it, but somehow it seems that way, hints of toasted hardwood, peat, Scotland. Very tasty.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

The beer itself was a deep mohagany color and very inviting looking. The aroma was quite muted but did impart some slight pineapple smell. The flavors on this one truely set it off. There was the afore mentioned pineapple from the nose, some dark cherry, banana, and the scotch/peet smoke that is typical of this style. There also was just enough hops to balance out the malt back bone and lend a little bitterness. The alcohol was very well hidden but started to warm after 2-3 gulps. Mouthfeel was virtually perfect.

679,"2011-09-21",3.7,"12 oz bottle poured at home. Beautiful translucent ruby color around the edges, becomes mahogany through chocolate brown in the center. A gorgeous beer. Aroma is smoked and roasted malts, peat, robust caramel, and a touch of vanilla. Rich, smokey, peaty malts form the body of the beers taste. Some caramel and vanilla swirls on the edges. Its held together by a bit of floral hops. The best touch of barnyard flavor floats in, too. Wonderful palate -- the beer briefly sits heavy and robust, then slides away, cleansed by the touch of hops. Nicely done.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","joechristenson"

679,"2011-09-16",3.0,"A: The beer pours a dark amber color with a creamy khaki colored head.

S: Quite a bit more fruity than many other Scotch ales.  Sweet toffee and caramel with some toasted bread and malt aromas.  Just a little bit of peat and smoke.

T: Sweet malt and bread with lots of peat.  A bit of caramel and toffee and a maybe a weird savory and salty flavor, almost like seaweed.  Theres a bit of a strange bitterness, too.

M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation.

679,"2011-09-13",4.0,"Bottle. The pour was a murky medium brown with a copper hue and had an average sized (1-2 finger) light brown rocky head that dissipated quickly but left a thin layer of foam that created some fair lacing.

The aroma was a bit on the sweet side with roasted bread malts, an herbal hop and a sweet doughy yeast with notes of raisons, molasses and a mild alcohol scent.

The taste was sweet and malty with a hint of molasses in the beginning and finished a bit bitter, with a touch of raisons and a mild alcohol tinge at the end that left the flavor to linger for a nice long while.

Mouthfeel was somewhere between medium and full in body and was rather dry in texture with a soft carbonation.

Overall an extremely tasty brew with the alcohol flavor kept to a minimum, yet still allowing for a nice warming sensation after the swallow.","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

679,"2011-04-20",3.9,"Appearance: Beautiful dark red hue, mostly hazy but some transparency to it. No noticeable carbonation. Forms a small, yellowish, soapy head. Decent retention and lacing.Smell: Red apple and caramel syrup. Touch of alcohol.Taste: This is the liquid equivalent of a candy apple. Rich caramel sweetness on the outside with a juicy red apple on the inside. Strange, but pleasing mix of fruit and sugar. Leaves a distinct bittersweet chocolate aftertaste as well to impart a touch of bitterness as well as round out the sweet aspect of the palate. Finishes with a slightly smoky flavor, but it seems to fade away after one a few swigs. Initially, a very delectable palate, but the beer doesnt finish as strong as it starts as it begins to become overtly milder and alcohol begins to distract from the main palate. Still very tasty and pleasing from first to last drop, though.Mouthfeel: Thick, soft, slightly stick, no noticeable carbonation. Thins out and becomes slightly watery towards the end.Drinkability: For an 8.5% ABV beer, Dirty Bastard most definitely does not drink or feel like it. While the palate is robust, the soft mouthfeel makes for a smooth, easy-drinking beer. Not refreshing per se, but fun to drink. Ideal to pair with a pie - especially pecan, rhubarb, or minced meat.

The beer pours with an almost garnet color and a thin white head that doesnt last long. Very low carbonation, as expected from a scotch ale, makes for a smooth drinking beer that goes down fast at 8.5%. While cold in the glass the beer has a mostly malt aroma with a hint of alcohol but as the beer warms it smells almost entirely of alcohol. The beer has a slight scotch character and a very dry finish due in part to the hop bite, but nothing special. The beer was undoubtedly swayed towards the sweet with only 50 IBU.

679,"2011-03-30",3.6,"12oz bottle poured into my De Struise glass... As it pours into the glass it looks like a bright copper, but this settles a deep mahogany. A light tan head rises a few fingers at first then settles to full finger cap. Im skeptical of this retention as the head looks very watery and light, not full enough for me. Very light lacing... The aroma is really too light, toffee on the front mostly, some light scotch notes on the back, not much going on. As it warms lots of peat comes through. Actually, this needs to warm quite bit out the fridge, really starts to open up and is very pleasant...The taste is a bit of let down for me. There is a scotch backbone that really dominates, too spirit like. Very chewy. Malt characters is gone.

S - The aroma is a very pungent sweet carmel malt. There are also some brown sugar and roasted elements also. There is also some booze in the nose.

T - Starts off with some deep dark fruit flavors and some of the malty carmel sweetness. Through the middle the carmel malt flavor gets a bit stronger and is joined by just a bit of hop flavor also. The finish is a mix of the carmel sweetness, the dark fruit flavors, and just a touch of booze, brown sugar, and bitterness that lingers. Nicely balanced.

M - Medium to heavy bodied with fairly low carbonation. Fairly think and almost creamy overall, but still smooth. Finish is just a tad dry and a tad syrupy.

D - Fairly drinkable. Very rich beer and a lot of flavors going on. Thankfully, the flavors are well balanced are work very well together. Not a beer to gulp down, and with the high abv (8.5 %) it is a very enjoyable beer at a bit of a slower pace.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

679,"2010-11-22",4.0,"Bottle from Vinmonopolet in Valkendorfsgate, Bergen. Pours a hazy, deep mahogany brown body with a creamy, medium off-white head. Aroma is smooth, deep toffee and caramel, with some vanilla and hints of chocolate and berries in the back. Taste is as smooth as the mouthfeel; a pure toffee pleasure trip gently streaming down my throat. This is good. A regular malt-fest going on here; some toffee, some sweet caramel appearing mid-palate and some roastiness towards the end. Very pleasant drinking, and though the alcohol is warming it is still very well integrated. A pleasure to drink, and the excellently crafted, creamy mouthfeel makes for EITHER a sipper or a faster-drinking beer. This is one dirty bastard ye jees gottu luv! :-D","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

Ar: Caramel, dried fruit, malt.
Ap: Pours a deep brown-red with a 1/2"" light cinnamon head that fades quickly and leaves little lace.
F: Very complex up front - dried figs, smoke, and a bit of chocolate.  It finishes with a bourbon-like bite.  However, I find the sweetness to be a bit cloying, even with the hop bitterness on the finish.
P: Thick, chewy body with semi-high carbonation.
O: Not a style I have that often, but this is quite good.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","spilledpint"

Some light grassy/peaty tones, particularly in the finish, and no hops to speak of. Carbonation is average, making the palate a little heavy and sticky - definitely some presence to this one.

This is a very good, full bodied Scotch Ale with a strong malty finish. It is a little thick to drink more than one or two and is very filling. It can probably replace a meal if you have more than one. The beer has a very malty aroma and somewhat of a black licorice aftertaste.

679,"2010-09-27",3.4,"I poured a 12 oz bottle into a snifter and the small head dissipated almost immediately. As it vanished, it left behind a thick yeasty aroma with hints of prune. This evoked a Belgian-style quadrupel ale, as did the beers ruby-russet color. Despite these hints of the abbey, the beer drank fairly American, especially in its dry finish that transformed the stone fruit to black grapes.

Well deserving of the wee-heavy label as it is bursting with layers of robust malt characteristics. Behind the roasted malt flavors are earthy hops creating a long lingering finish. Wait for it to warm a bit and it suggests raisons and caramel. Full bodied mouth feel, a tad chewy. High carbonation hides its strength as it does not come close to feeling 8.5%. Ill crank out a few of these and get smacked in the face before I realize it. For a style I am not usually impressed by this is a really good representation of a Scottish Strong Ale.

679,"2010-05-09",4.5,"He poured murky browns and faded mahogany into my glass where he settled under a small layer of khaki foam. Lace sticks to the sides of my glass like nobodys business, and a thin ringlet is his only decoration. But then, anything more would get in the way of his massive nose which just hit mine. Caramel and red apples galore followed by sprinklings of cinnamon and nutmeg, finishing with a flourish of toffee and a whiff of chocolate. Hm... Im having candy bar flashbacks, and I dont know why Alcohol nips at the back of my nose, tingling and teasing with spice, warmth, and dry wood read for the fire pit. Despite a straightforward nose, his palate is surprisingly more subtle and subdued, choosing the slow and supple path versus the in-your-face path. Slick, smooth, and mouthcoating, I am left once more smacking my lips in thirsty satisfaction, each lick a candied apple delight. A generous helping of dry brown spices permeates each quaff, enhancing and accentuating the immediate glow of warmth in the back of my throat creeping its way into my chest. Sweet, crunchy, woody, and spiced, cinnamon mingles with crisp fall red apples while esters of caramel and toffee crunchies waft on by. Closing my eyes, I am transported to a small cabin amidst the rolling hills of Scotland. A chill permeates the air, matched only by the crackling fire before me as I settle deep into a cushy chair, glass of Founders Dirty Bastard Scotch-style Ale in hand, and absolutely no where else I want to be.

<rb>
Romantic? A bit maybe, but like most things, romanticism got its start in reality. I prefer a mingling mix of the two, and Founders heartily delivered. I wasnt always fond of scotch ales, but the more I open my palate and mind to all beery possibilities, the more I appreciate their malty gifts. If you are ever somewhere where Founders beers can be found, grab a cart and have at it.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Found all over, if a pub has this beer available, I will default to it if there are no other beers of interest available (malty, darks, stouts, porters, or browns).

679,"2010-04-21",3.8,"A- Body is a rich dark mahogany hue. Pours with a 2 finger creamy tan head that eventually tapers off into a thick collar and plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass. Body is translucent and lots of particles can be seen floating throughout.

S-Deep, rich, and syrupy with chocolate malt dominating. Caramel malt and alcohol also make a strong presence.

T- Flavor pretty consistent throughout. Roasted chocolate and caramel malts are the main characters here and they make a strong presence throughout. The taste sweetens for the finish but a big roasted bitterness lingers along with a medium alcohol burn.

P- Big, thick, syrupy mouthfeel characteristic for the style. Carbonation is medium and does not get in the way of the smoothness of the mouthfeel.

O- Ive only sampled a few from this style and this seems to be a solid example. ABV is normal for the style and alcohol presence plays a big role in this brew. Sweet caramel and roasted bitter chocolate mix well and leave behind a nice warmth. Decent overall-but I am confident I can find other examples of this style I enjoy more.

I could pick out a few notes of smoke and peat, however, would have enjoyed more. Malt is offset by a nice hoppy bite at the end that helps avoid it becoming cloying.  For the abv, this is easy to drink and can creep up on you.  Id definitely would let this warm a bit, as the complexities come out the longer it sits.

Mouthfeel is very substantial but its a little too carbonated for my taste, just slightly so.

679,"2009-10-07",3.8,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a medium brown with just the slightest tan head that is gone within about 45 seconds.  My sample is an unapologetic ode to all things malt.  The aroma brings a malt aroma that, if one closes his eyes, leads him to think that he is in the boiling room of Briess.  Almost doppelbock-like notes of Munich come through.  Some middle crystal notes are also noticeable, giving a strong scent of caramel and toffee.

The malt character found in the palate nearly penetrates to the soul.  Rich toffee comes through first, almost as if they had bought a palate of hard-tack caramels, and then dumped them into the boil.  Again, Crystal 60 thru 80 seems to evidence itself here.  Interestingly (and slightly out of style), there is a moderate hop bitterness that runs through the mid-palate to the finish.  While it is surprising, I think it is quite pleasant, and helps the beer from being cloying.  The finish is a balance between sweet and bitter, and lasts forever.

I dont love it or want to go out and purchase a case, however, its not all too bad.  It poured a light brown - rust color and was very cloudy.  I simply couldnt put my finger what I was smelling and tasting.  At first it seemed like I was smelling caramel, but then it went into an apple smell, reminding me of Fall, and trips to the cider mill.  Taste was the most strange thing - after thinking about it for a while, it reminded me of breakfast...some sort of combination of bacon, pancakes, and maple syrup, all along with the fall (cider and caramel)...Just very odd.  I liked it overall.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","MereLikesBeer"

The nose is thick with sweet molasses notes, with other dark fruits, figs and malts.  Interesting flavor palate.... it comes off first as dry, just shy of roasted, with a twinge of alcohol to keep the bitters upfront.  The effervescence of sweetness is never really lost, though, and the integration of the two contrasts is nice.  The peat shows up in the finish, complementing the linear feel of the pull.  Good brew overall, with the ABV well-integrated, and a medium-lively mouthfeel.  As the body feels toward the medium to medium-soft side, this brew really exploits the contrasts and differences that end up complementing one another so well.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

679,"2008-11-18",4.3,"12oz bottle. Pours a deep brown with gorgeous, ruby-red highlights and a thin, brown head that leaves persistent swirls over the beer and light lacing on the glass. The aroma is bready, toasty, and biscuity with subtle toffee and cocoa, fruity and earthy hops, and dark fruit. The flavor starts big and malty with a delectable malt sweetness that is laden with caramel, toffee, and biscuits. There is a slight dryness and roastiness - subtle coffee and roasted barley. The roasted grain flavors take on a slightly ashy note at mid-palate, and hops and esters enter to form a very nice, complex fruitiness. The bitterness is wonderfully balancing - a little hoppy in the end with a big, sweet, slightly roasty, toasty malt finish. The mouthfeel starts crisp with carbonation and thick. As the CO2 is released (from swirling in the mouth), the texture thickens into a rich and luxurious silk - full-bodied but not syrupy. Overall - a marvelous beer - well-balanced and drinkable. Perfect for cool weather but not so rich, strong, or sweet as to be a ""nip bottle only"" kind of beer. I don’t think it fits the label of Scotch Ale perfectly - a bit hoppier than one might expect. But it is really, really nice.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

More like the concentrated essence of a wood paneled den full of leather, scotch, cigar smoke and academic one-upmanship.  Smooth malt, peat, molasses sweetness, with a surprisingly hoppy finish.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark orangey red with a small, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light to moderate caramel malt, light milk chocolate, cherry and smoke. The initial flavor was moderately sweet, and lightly acidic and bitter; while the finish was lightly sweet and acidic, and moderately bitter with and average duration. It was very smokey with some caramel malt. The medium body was sorta syrupy with soft to tingly carbonation and light astringent finish.

Coupled with the main course was this release.  After a few starters it was hard to get through this one.  Despite taking it easy a beer this heavy can sink in the stomach.  I would love to try it again on its own and on a fairly empty stomach to fully appreciate it.  This is a solid beer instead of just one with a earcatching name.
Aroma / Appearance - The deep ruby red body swirled around the glass leaving a slight layer of film along the sides.  Black cherries, peat, wet earth and dark malts formed a thick grouping that almost choked the senses.  While not the richest beer I could have spent plenty of time admiring it.
Flavor / Palate - A slight bitterness washes along with warmth and chocolately tones.  Peat and earth come next.  The dry finish leaves one refreshed and full.  A little heavy for a warm day this might be nice on a cool fall evening.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma of burly pit fruits and strawberry candies; a pure and decadent but still soft note of scotch whiskey dripping with peat smoke and pillowy tobacco character.  So rich, generous, and simple.  Flavor is not especially dark but very deep, giving hints of peat, charred raisins, and raspberries to speckle the body of viscous maple, dark honey, scotch, and milk chocolate.  A tower of carefully polished malt complexity.  Medium to full palate is luxuriously silky with a distant sparkle of carbonation; finish is semisweet chocolate and caramel before turning tannic and bitter like a blend of a muscley shiraz and dry citrusy hops.

679,"2008-02-19",3.4,"Small but dense beige-brown head over hazy, opaque chestnut beer. Sweet, maltsyrup nose, but with touches of both hops and alcohol. Sweet rum cake, laced with hops and raisins. Quite roasted, too. Hopped & roasted, as a cake that has been thouroughly baked on the outside, becoming bitter-burnt, hiding the sweetness inside. A bit syrupy, affirmed by the MF. It is pulling a bit in two directions, ending a bit irresolute. Well bodied. Again undecided syrupy - thinner. Alcohol obvious, even some fusels. Especially the aftertaste betrays resins, whilst the smokiness spoken of, is very tardy in coming in the open. Nice, if undecided beer.  Thanks to Eric from BA!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
679,"2008-02-13",3.7,"In short: A nice easy to drink hoppy scotch ale.
How: Bottle 12oz, 6+ months old
The look: Cloudy dark burgundy body with a short-lived tan head.
In long: Nose of barley candy and tobacco.  Taste has lots barley candy, some residual sugar, some kind of spicy liquorice and a light berry flavour.  Very little fruity flavours.  Pleasant body but certainly not a thick decadent scotch ale.  A bit oily.  A lot more hoppy than average for the style but Im in the minority who prefers hoppy scotch ales.  Tasty resinous oily citrusy hops makes it highly drinkable.  Alcohol is apparent but doesnt detract from the drinkability.  This is like a session scotch ale.  Not often that I come across a dirty bastard that I find very sweet.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
679,"2008-02-10",3.1,"Sept. 2006 - I have to say, I did actually enjoy this beer more than the rating indicates.  However, for style, this was a stinker.  Beer poured with dark brown color with next to a little head and small lacing.  The aroma was smoky...a lot more so than the flavor.  The flavor was curiously devoid of smoke and earthiness, but abounding in candy flavor and caramel.  Rich creamy mouthfeel was the highlight of this one. Some hops were definitely noticeable.  If you are hankering for a scottish ale, this isnt your beer, though...and for that, it gets a big BOOOO!","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"

Flavor is pretty meaty with a consistent wood character going on. Thick caramel sweetness is there as well. Nice and robust. It seems like I am getting a small amount of alcohol on the flavor though. Feel has a decent carbonation and a smooth liquid feel. Overall pretty good. Nice and hearty and pretty rustic.

Ive been wanting some Founders, because they are rated highly and some of their brews sound delicious...but this one wasnt it. Very nice and complex aroma and appearance, full of roasty malts, carmel, hops, and smoke. But taste wise is where this one fell apart for me. Tastes thick in some places, thin in others. Very sticky and syrupy on the back end, and the alcohol seemed to get int he way of the flavor.

Since Ive always really had a soft spot for Scotch ales, I was pretty excited to finally pop the top on this one. 

So the beer pours out a dark brown color, mostly opaque but it started to clear on the end, with red highlights on the edges. A huge 4 finger thick khaki head erputed from my glass. It had some serious staying power and the head kept true thru the entire beer. Aroma was semi-sweet, malty, caramel, subtle run and smoke notes run along side a peaty note. Flavor is more sweetness, caramel covered raisins with a slightly over-carbonated finish. Would have received a bit higher scores from me if it was a little smoother.

Taste is smooth, a little bitter, with the dark fruits being the main thing here.  Sweetness is surprisingly low, which is a good thing I think.  Drinkability is higher than the aroma and ABV would lead you to believe.  One of the better Scotch ales Ive had.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

679,"2007-07-30",1.7,"How could you not like the name of this brew?  Short stubby 12 oz bottle that is certainly not a long neck.  Has a twist off cap. No head. Cloudy root beer appearance. Chocolate rubbing alcohol aroma, really attractive.   OOOH, smoothness makes you take a big swig then the malt alky impact whacks you in the palate. A rather strong alky brew and it tells you. It is so easy to confuse scotch ale with the milder Scottish ales. Simply just buzz making.  What a brew, like somebody spiked this beer with whiskey. Strong, numbs up the old tase buds rather quickly. Yes, the taste is somewhat like the aroma; big bold and intoxicating.  Really coats the back of your throat. Finish is medium long and malty alcohol bitter.  Barely acceptable as a beer because of its style but it is on par with 	McEwans Scotch Ale, OB Chubb and 3Fs the bruce.

679,"2007-06-20",3.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.(I must have misplaced my thistle?)  This Scotch Ale poured a hazy, dark reddish brown color with visible carbonation when held up to light.  Virtually no head or lace to speak of.  The aroma of this beer was made up of sweet caramel malts, light yeast notes, and a bit of wood.  The flavor is dominated by smokey malt richness.  Some sweet caramel notes followed by a big roasted, smokey malt flavor.  A touch of hop bitterness is present at the end.  The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with light carbonation, leaving a lasting smokey taste on your tongue.  Towards the bottom of the glass, it reminds me of drinking a Scotch and water.  The flavor seems to become a bit muted by the smoke.  I enjoyed the aroma and flavors that this beer presented, but the smokey finish seemed to detract from the overall experience.  Made my mouth feel like I had sat next to a campfire for a few hours, directly in the line of the smoke eminating from the flame.  A decent beer, but maybe just not my cup of tea.

When I opened the bottle I immediately smelled scotch. When poured and held to my nose I smelled toasted grains up front. Followed by a sweetness of candied dark fruits. The toasted grains remain throughout with hints of the fruits, a hint of wood, and vanilla. There even seems to be a little mustiness.

Fairly complex beer. Up front I pick up a very mild toasted malt but its quickly overtaken by a wave of roasted malts and caramel at mid-palate.The wave settles with a deep roastines and caramel flavor. An earthy quality follows all the big flavors in the finish. A slight lingering bitterness shows up just before the swallow and lingers for just a few seconds. 

The mouthfeel accompanies the taste very well. It is a little on the heavy side of medium bodied. Nice and creamy like the way it should be.

Drinkability is good if you drink this how it should be drunk. Its a sipper in every sense of the word. That drops the drinkability just because of all the big dark flavors.

Taste fruity and dirty at the same time with some cherry, plum,  caramel, tobacco, dirt and coffee flavors.  Tastes as involved as it sounds.  I like the way this beer finishes pretty light, but noticably dry, dirty and woody.  Its not meant to be a hopbomb, and the finish, while bitter, is not really a ""hoppy"" bitter.  The mouthfeel has a way of feeling thick without being heavy at all.  Wonderfully creamy and low carbonation.  It has some sweetness with no cloying factor at all.

679,"2007-01-09",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2007 I was a little disappointed by this Scotch Ale. I am generally an advocate of this style. It is unfortunate that they are few in variety for the most part, as not many Scotch Ales are distributed in Rhode Island. However, this beer all caramel malt, with a sheer whiskey mouthfeel. The bourbon taste is all well and good, but there is a very weak hop balance that makes this brew one dimensional...Old Chubb is much better.","USA","Beerio"

The flavor starts off with some hop bitterness and slight roasted maltiness. Then deeper roasted malt sweetness, sort of molasses, and a bit of dark fruit come out of hiding. Tough to pin down the flavor any more than that. Maybe there is a touch of brown sugar in there too. I also get a slight sense of the ABV.

679,"2006-11-03",4.0,"Pours a murky brown with some burgundy hues under a thin tan head. Head quickly settles to a slick film which persists throughout the glass.  The initial aroma is of assertive peat smoked malts, followed by faint notes of burnt caramel candy, dark wheat bread, raisins, black cherries and a touch of herbal hops. Carbonation is appropriately subtle resulting in a smooth, slightly oily and slick moutfeel. Just right for this style. Initial flavor leans toward the sweet side presenting burnt caramel, brown sugar, raisins and figs with a hint of chocolate. The hops and alcohol eventually emerge in the late palate and finish with a fairly crisp, dry bitterness and ethanol warmth. Kind of an ""Amercanized"" hoppy version of the style, reminiscent of old Bert Grants Scotch Ale, but a nice winter season beer.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Very, very malty taste with healthy woody/peaty bitterness, thick toffee and dark caramel, light roast, red berry, and very light alcohol more towards the end.  Very full-bodied with a wonderful hops/malt balance, no small feat considering the massive malt levels.  Also a nice balance struck between sweet/bitter.  Hoppy grit begins the aftertaste.  This is almost sticky, but not quite, and thick to the point of being sludgy - about as full-tasting as a beer can be.  Complex and mature, a really nice Scotch Ale!

Creamy rich malt lends caramel, toffee, and event hints of chocolate to this ale.  Intermingled with the alcohol are whispers of smoke and light floral hops.  The mouthfeel is unbelievably over the top.  Incredibly luxurious, I would expect this feel much more from an imperial stout than a scotch ale.  The flavors do not disappoint.  Big sweet malt lends a nice backdrop over which the roast and smoke can play.  Theres some definite alcohol in the flavor helping to cut the sweetness as well as a some gentle engish style hops.  I really enjoyed this, and perhaps it should be rated even higher, but compared to the aroma and the mouthfeel, I just couldnt justify bringing the flavor up any.

Thick sweet aroma of rich roast caramel malt, wood, chocolate and hops, nice and boozy - lightly peaty scotch.  Taste of chocolate malt, quite roasty, not as sweet as the aroma, with more prominent alcohol and wood resin - it actually has a fairly bitter finsh - I like the balance, and the peat character is very appealing to me.

Well balanced flavour starts off sweet and malty along with some chocolate and smoke and ends with mild alcohol and citrus hops. The alcohol is well hidden for an 8.3 % beer. Syrupy mouthfeel and medium to full bodied. Pretty good, I enjoyed it quite a bit.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"

I now know what people mean by the smell of peat--this beer has it, a very earthy smell along with some alcohol and smokiness.  Also has some chocolate cherry notes. Taste is more of the same.   Not really noticing much bitterness than a slight bitter finish.  Not a bad beer by any means, but I think this may be my first Scotch ale, so Im not a huge fan of the style just yet.  I may rerate once I get to the end up the sixer.

679,"2005-11-30",3.5,"This beer is super carbonated; it starts to foam as soon as I pop the cap.  The head on this is easily three-fingers thick and is a light amber-brown color.  The beer is a deep amber color that shows a murky ruby-orange color when held up to the light.  The aroma is pretty darn pronounced with strong notes of maraschino cherry, caramel, sweet toffee and a bit of toasty malt notes at the end.  The aroma definitely has a sharp sweetness to it.  As the beer warms up it picks up a bit of subtle phenolic smokiness and maybe even a hint of some musty-type character.

The beer is quite full on the palate, but the high carbonation makes it seem a bit lighter than it actually is.  A couple of swirls later, I have released the excess carbonation, lets see what the beer is like now.  The beer is fairly sweet, but not as much as the aroma suggested; it is a mix of caramel and toffee sweetness.  There is a bit of that cherry sweetness, but it is much more subdued than the nose.  The finish has notes of roast malt, a hint of coffee and a dry toasty note; plus it also has a hint of alcohol to it.  There is not much in the way of perceptible hop notes here; the malt certainly dominates.  This beer is definitely a sipping beer.

I was a bit worried, because of the high carbonation, that the beer was infected, but I dont get any of that in the taste.  As the beer warms up a bit I get a note reminiscent of rum in the finish (both a bit of alcohol heat and the fermented/ distilled molasses flavor).  This is quit a tasty beer and, unlike some of their other high octane offerings, this one has a nice balance to it, despite being a malt bomb.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The appearance of this brew is absolutely perfect (looks of rich mahogany).  Sweet up front with a  nice roasty finish.  A full mouthfeel and it goes down so smooth.

Virtually no hop flavor at all.  Finish is alcoholic but very pleasant.  This has a great thick chewy mouthfeel with  minimal carbonation.  Mouth coating but  not cloying.

It smells of smokey malts and lots of caramel.  I wish that the strong maltiness would have been backed up by a more intense hop attitude.  Drinkability is a real problem with this beer.  I might try this again b/c im a big fan of Founders other products.","USA","maawallace"
679,"2005-07-10",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2006 Bottle.  Sweet caramel, malty aroma, with some grassy hops in there too to balance it out a bit.  Flavor is rich and sweet,  with some smoked notes, bit of roast, and again, grassy hops.  Fairly bitter finish.  A bit of alcohol does show, but its not distracting.  Quite tasty, better as it warms.   Ill certainly buy this again.  Real nice brew.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"
679,"2005-07-10",3.6,"Dark purple-ish red in color with lasting, sticky lace - plum, toffee and herbs in the aroma - lots of caramel malt in the flavor, with a touch of peat smoked malt way in the back - a tad sweet with nothing much to balance it, but still very tasty - quite an odd beer to be a flagship product, so I tip my hat to them for that.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
679,"2005-07-10",4.0,"Upon first pouring this beer, the head is quite full, but quickly diminishes to a lasing around the sides of the glass.    THe aroma is very mild: full of heather, and earthy, herbal notes.  Mild, yet well-balanced beer.  Cocoa, herbs,  caramel and quite buttery predominate the flavor.  A nice example of the style.  The malts hang on in the finish.  It finishes smooth and creamy.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
679,"2005-07-09",3.5,"Sampled from a bottle, it pours to a thick, long lasting creamy/rocky tan head.  The body is  a dark red/brown color.  The aroma reminds me of peat and homemade strawberry fruit rollups after theyve been in the dhydrator for hours and are still warm.  I also get a touch of smoke.  The flavor is peaty, and also reminds me of how really old wood smells.  Sweet, smoky, earthy, woody.  The flavor is simply put... strange.  I love Scotch, but this doesnt remind me much at all of that.  Instead, this is more like being at a campfire with burning sugars, wood, and peat whofting through the air.  Im not big into this style, but I feel that this is a well produced beer.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
679,"2005-07-08",3.9,"Nice large long lasting head from a vigorous pour.  Settles slowly.  Wonderful, thick aroma with plenty of malts, caramel, peat and bit of smoke and rotting wood.  Color is a hazy dark magagony brown.  Flavor is rich and sweet but luxurious as it goes down.  Nice alcohol warming.  Plenty of malts again, a bit of roastyness, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, scrumptious.  Finish is creamy and coating.  Lingering tingle form the alcohol.  A top quality scotch ale.  Props go out to RoyalBrown for this one.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

679,"2005-07-05",3.8,"From a 12-oz. bottle: Pours a deep, clear ruby with a full tan head.  Very pretty. Complex, yeasty aroma.  First taste is a big wallop of caramelly malt, followed by an almost syrupy sweetness.  Very rich mouthfeel.   Not much bittering; this beer is way over on the sweet side of the spectrum (which isnt surprising, considering the high alcohol content). BONUS: two bottles of this will make a bagpipe serenade sound good (though I still couldnt bring myself to dig into a plate of haggis).","Wisconsin, USA","NeonLX"

679,"2005-06-20",3.6,"Pours deep reddish brown without any head to speak of.  Aroma is exceptionally sweet and malty -- hard to get past.  The flavor follows similarly -- the malt is too cloyingly sweet to get past and recognize any of the subtleties behind it.  The finish is drier than the initial flavor, but I still found it to be a fairly inaccessible beer -- I cant taste through the residual sugars.  Great mouthfeel, though; syrupy and rich.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Jonathan3584"
679,"2005-06-16",3.8,"Bottled.  From trade with OhioDad, thank you.  Pours a deep dark ruby garnet color with no haze and no significant head.  Appears minimally carbonated.  Aroma is very malty sweet with caramel and dark dried fruits and a complex ester profile.  A bit of smoke creeps up in the nose as well.  Flavor is very sweet and one dimensional upfront.  However, in the drier finish, more complexities come out: subtle smoke and fruity esters with some dried cherry and raisons. Alcohol and hops are minimally apparent in the flavor though a pleasant moderate bitterness lingers in the finish.  Body is extremely full and silky smooth and the low carbonation goes well in this beer.  I could only drink one of these in a given session due to the sweetness and body but very good nonetheless.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","BlueDevil0206"

679,"2005-05-18",3.8,"Another great beer from Founders, this one pours an opaque black with tinges of dark bronze capped by a thin layer of dense foam.  The aroma is decidedly malty but hints of hops.  It also has that tasty mustiness you get from other good porters, such as Stone Smoked Porter.  The mouthfeel is heavy and velvety.  Chocolaty hints give way to a tidal wave of sweet maltiness.  The finish is complex, consisting of a backdrop of characteristic Scotch ale alcohol flavor punctuated by modest cherry tones, a more pronounced hop presence, and finally, the gentle sting of carbonation at the back of the throat.

I had this beer on draft at MacNivens, a Scottish-themed restaurant and bar on Massachusetts Avenue in downtown Indy.  MacNivens has an anxious-makingly large selection of interesting beers on draft and in bottles.

A decent, but not great beer. Original rating follows. Dark brown with some red on the edges with the light. A very thin slightly yellow colored head. The aroma is toffee and caramel. Also some walnuts. The taste has toasted malts and toffee. Hints of mint and some bread crust. A medium nouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. The sweetness of the malt is a little cloying.

679,"2003-07-06",3.2,"On draught at Lazy Chameleon in Powell, OH. This beer is a dark brown with a copper hue and a thin light beige head. Very little lacing. Aroma is mostly caramel malt with a little spice thrown in. The flavor was not really reminiscent of other Scotch Ales I have tried. It seemed to be leaning more toward a Brown Ale. Flavors of caramel, malt, molasses and brown sugar are all there, but not in the doses you would expect. Still, it is not a bad beer. The finish is more bitter than most Scotch Ales as well.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
679,"2003-07-04",3.3,"Copper body with a light tan head, does not last as long as it should.  Heavy sweet caramel malt aroma w/ a little roastiness and grainy for a Scotch ale.  No smokiness or fruit aromas are detectible, but I'm picking up traces of chocolate malt.  Caramel malt very apparent in the flavor and a little roast, as well as some chocolate and alcohol.  Well balanced, but toward malt, no hop flavor that I noticed.  Alcohol noticeable, but not hot, with a subdued carbonation and medium full M/F.  This one seems a little light for what I expected from a Scotch ale, and it also a little astringent.  Nice attempt at a Scotch, but fall short IMHO.  Better than most, but not as good as some.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
679,"2003-07-02",3.4,"(draft @RBSG2003):  Clear red-brown with medium tan head.  Aroma is mild -- sweet and caramel.  Taste is medium sweet, floral, caramel, malty, mild alcohol and minimal bitterness.  Medium/full body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
679,"2003-06-29",3.7,"Bottle: Good nose roasted molasses and some smoke. Nice clear brownish amber color.  Smokey malty with a bitter hops flavor. Creamy with a typical higher abv warmth about it.

679,"2003-06-15",3.6,"Aroma of freshly-baked bread drizzled with melted toffee and caramel, with a touch of vinous malt, floral hop spice, pine and a small dosage of yeast esters.  Deep brownish red color, hazed, with a fine, light tan head and a nice bit of lacing.  Fruity, almost candyish sweetness to start, quickly joined by earthy, spicy, Pacific Northwest-style hop flavors and carrying each other throughout.  Becoming bready and slightly roasty, bitter and dry  towards the finish, although all previous aspects of flavor persist.  Smooth, lightly acidic palate, fairly full-bodied.  Very interesting and stronger than it tastes in regards to alcohol level.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
679,"2003-06-13",4.1,"Somebody has got to be kidding, I'm with MartinT on this one.  This is one of the best Scottish Ales I've had.  Brown colored with a head that crosses the glass, transluscent.  Aroma of malt very similiar to an ESB.  Carmel flavor with enough bitterness to make it more than one dimensional, but not enough to dominate the malt character.  Bitter, dry finish, excellent beer!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"

679,"2003-06-04",3.7,"Poured a dark amber, and developed a thin tan head.  The basic recipe for this one seems to be as follows: take an amber ale, and add twigs, berries, molasses, dark fruits, feces, and smarm.  Top it off with 10%/90% SARS/sorbitol solution and fermented maxi pads.  In other words, if you find a hypodermic needle in your bottle, go back to the establishment you purchased it from and pay them double.  A previous reviewer had it right: the malts leave you feeling violated, filthy, and self-pitying.  Woe to he who dares tame the Dirty Bastard.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

679,"2003-05-26",3.8,"Poured a dark ruby brown body under a tan (with a hint of amber) head that settled into a hurricane pattern in my snifter.  Thick malts - not overly sweet (thanks).  I get a lot of rum and cinnamon in this, and in the background, it's cinnamon bread and enough hop to dry it out at the finish.  This is nearly perfectly balanced for my palate (if you got this from the tap, would it, could it, be a tad more hoppy?)","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
679,"2003-05-23",4.0,"This ribbin' lit'le gent knocked me off me arse. Sweet, sensual and balanced. The hops are light, the malt is thick and heavy and the combined flavor strong, pungent and very much a dirty bastard. Left me feeling cheap, used, confused and ashamed until my scotish blood began to boil and erupt with song. I must have sung ten rounds of ""danny boy"" while playing the air bagpipes until I collaped in a pool of my own urine, thus fulfilling the prophacy of the ""dirty bastard"". For he was I and I he.

679,"2003-05-06",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2003 This bottle yields a dark reddish brown brew, fairly cloudy, with a decent light tan head.  Aroma is a nice mix of malt, hops, and some spices I just can't place.  A good aroma, though.  The flavor to this one is unlike any flavor I've seen in a Scots Ale.  Almost vineous in the manner of some imperial stouts, though obviously not of the same variety.  Also of note is a light/medium hops bite in the finish, which is stronger than most hops notes in Scots Ales.  I have to say that this beer, to me, seems underrated.  This is a very unique and delicious Scots Ale.  A great brew!","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"

Be careful though it goes down real smooth, almost too smooth for something at %8.3.  The first time I had this I didn't realize just how high the percentage was until I read the side of the box after my 5th. I think its safe to say that this is my favourite brew from Founders.","Seattle, Washington, USA","AlabastorJones"

679,"2002-12-02",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2006 The pour yields an impressive rocky, tan, and sticky foam.  Quality nose of dark bread, rum, very grainy malt, pecan, apple, cinnamon, honey, and an unusual-to-the-style faint tropical fruit hop character.  Only a slight phenolic hint lies beneathe this nearly flawless aroma.  Zero trace of peated malt.  A plethora of flavors lay on this silky palate:  extremely warming alcohol, cinnamon toast lingering with cardboardish malt, coconut, pineapple, fig, burnt sugar hint, coarse hop feel, and almost a numbing medicinal malt note that outshines the remainder of the brews flavors.  A quality example, which is very aggressive when found fresh.  Reminds me of a lessened Double Bastard.  Absolutely boastful in the malt and hop department.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

It overlooks the Grand River and is in a part of Grand Rapids where theyre starting to redo all the buildings.  Anyway, this was a great dark beer.  Fairly heavy, but not too much so.  I would get this one again.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"

But after drinking it, I think she was right.  Ultra complex, slightly sweet, roasty, nutty, with lots more going on that I cant even identify.  Its very full bodied and quite smooth.

My god; I mean, taking away the fact that the aroma is fairly non-existant... the flavor and palate is spectacular. Roasted cherries, grapes and some nut, seemed to change consistency in my mouth almost... from a thin start to an instantaneous switch to full bodied, creamy and finishing off by trickling slowly down the throat, revealing the smokey, nut dry finish that was quite nice, this beer had it all... I honestly cant figure out why this beer is rated so low; maybe I was on crack or something, who knows. Perhaps it was the unrelenting flavor...","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","slinkymello"
