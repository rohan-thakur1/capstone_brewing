Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, raisin, plum, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light dark fruit, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish.

Dark Ruby Red in color, like cranberry juice. Looks more like a standard bock more than a Maibock. nice pillowy white head floats atop a finger deep. fades to a light lacing.

smells of tofee and malt with a bit of fig and cherry. I get a little earthy and spicy hop undertone, a little spiciness almost like Chevre(goat cheese) I dont smell much for floral aroma like i expect from a maibock.

taste is malt forward with toffee/caramel and cherry/fig sweetness. the middle comes in a little of the earthy hops but none of the floral attitude i want. there is some breadiness that comes through in here and a finish of bitter earthy hops.

mouthfeel is mellow and smooth but a little thick for a Maibock.

easy to drink but overall, this is off for the style.

4172,"2010-05-09",3.0,"Bomber.  Pours a clear, dark, garnet to crimson color with a small, smooth head of beige tinted foam.  A thick wash of suds leaves tiny, scattered spots of sugary lacing on the glass.  The aroma is based in dark, caramelized sugars (think toasted marshmallow), prunes, raisins, and bread dough.  Theres a hint cocoa, though it is more savory than sweet, almost as though its been baked right into the bread element.  Flavors follow suit, again quite sweet initially with loads of dark, fruity sugars, yet somewhat balanced by the toasted, doughy bread element.  Prunes and plums both play a big role, while raisins and cocoa seem more secondary.  Earthen hops are present, but not in great proportion.  On the palate, dense sugars offer most of the substance, coating the mouth in a sticky, sugary glaze that hangs around too long.  Though its a pretty decent representation of the style, this one just doesnt do much for me.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Extremely raisiny with a hint of red licorice. Carbonation is fluffy yet tight on the palate. Full bodied. Soothingly malty and pillowy with a delicate nuttiness which gracefully rolls over the palate as it links up with a pronounced yet beautifully composed plummy fruitiness. Powdery notes of hay-tinged malt imparts texture and depth as it contrasts with the slick and succulent plummy fruitiness. Very clean and well extracted maltiness. Candied malt flavors are firm with a honeyed biscuit, toffee-glazed and candy apple quality. Red licorice also exudes in plentitude. Faint metallic twang harmonizes with the fruitiness to perfectly balance the sweetness while providing lift and drinkability. Attenuation is outstanding. Despite the fruitiness, the yeast and coarse minerals manage to keep the body from becoming limp as they provide plenty of snap.  Residual sweetness imparts butter toffee as well as a hint of vanilla nougat. Balance is impeccable, and overt sweetness never plagues the flavor. Finishes relentlessly malty with lengthy notes of hay, nuts and caramel adorned with raisins and plums. Complex and highly quaffable, two essential elements in a well made bock.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4172,"2007-02-26",3.7,"Spring 2006 bottle from Crosling, drunk on 2/25/07, thanks Nick!Lovely, light-garnet with light auburn and darker mahogany hues as well.  Beige head forms quite small, despite a vigorous pour, but is retained nearly perfectly throughout the entire glass.  Light to moderate lacing is left behind in small patches with a fair amount of carbonation in the liquid and high clarity, leaving some moderate sediment in the bottle.Plenty of melanoidins show a true bock-like character, with just a touch of grainy roast giving the hint of singed wood.  Boisterous strawberries, raspberries and light melon notes combine with sweet medium malts and pale malts to give a bit of toffee-caramel and lots of sweet cream aromas.  Moderately acidic, punchy yeast character on the finish is very authentic and still characterful after almost 8 months in the bottle.  No alcohol or other flaws perceivable.  Fairly high strength of aroma.Fruitiness and very sweet malts are the mainstay in the flavor, adding lots of fruity tartness and moderate acidic character on the finish.  But the moderately-heavy, sweet malts balance soaking up most of the acid.  A bit mushy at this point, but the gentle, low carbonation makes it seem borderline creamy.  Cinnamon, vanilla and some spicy hop bitterness all are layered atop a light breadiness.  With every sip, vanilla cream-like malt sweetness mixes with very bright fruit flavors to give an enticing (though tending sweet) balanced flavor.  Nice and drinkable if youre in the mood for something on the hearty side.  No alcohol perceived in flavor, no flaws.  Body could stand to be a touch more crisp/dry.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4172,"2006-10-22",3.6,"Pours with an initially two-finger thick, amber tan colored head that is frothy and with a touch of staying power.  The aroma is dominated by Bock-like concentrated malt notes.  The beer itself is a brilliantly clear, dark amber brown color.  Heavy on aromatic Maillard browning notes, I get notes of caramel, toasted grain, burnt brown sugar and succulent prunes.  Speaking of plums, there is even a tart note here that seems to be clearly derived from the ample use of malts.  This beer just screams malt, exactly what I want to see in a bock.

Somewhat light up front, lightly sweet with heavily caramelized malt notes.  Despite being fairly light, this beer is big and chewy, meaty even beyond the relatively light palate.  This beer does have some lingering power though; concentrated malt notes linger on, stuck to my mouth, even after the beer has passed down my gullet.  Towards the finish of this beer it really does start to pick up a heft, a rich bodied character, that was not initially apparent to me.  The beer is so malt forward as to almost have a certain fruitiness to it; this is of course, the entirely wrong descriptor and I am using terms such as meaty and ""fruity yet not"" to capture the richness of this brew.  It is almost like a gravy made from malts, by which I mean malt that has been stewed and concentrated and made into, instead of a sauce, a rich brew.

While at first I was surprised at how dark this was for something described as a Spring Bock, as I work my way through this beer it becomes clear to me that it is indeed an apt title.  The beer is light up front, akin to the promise of summer, but still rich and satiating at the same time, like the winter just passed.  Definitely fits nicely as a spring time brew; it has all the malty goodness of a Bock, yet still strikes a lightness at times on the palate that makes this ever so quaffable.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Nose is pleasant, but not great; nutty, with vanilla, caramel, and chocolate.  Also toasty with some faint rauch notes.  Slight roast hits the tongue with the smoke now emerging with a definite toasty, chocolate, toffee flavor.  Palate is appropriate, medium-light body, moderate carbonation, with a clean lager feel.  A decent amount of hops follow to fill out the maibock, however the finish quite short.  Very intriguing brew; like a maidopplebock with some rauch to make things interesting.

Rich and creamy, but also very clean with no traces of phenolics that sometimes mar lesser attempts.

-Frail head over the orangey red.
-Berry fruitiness eyes the inherent pils malt vegetal character which strangely recalls potato skins for me.
-Potent cranberry fruitiness isnt helped by the lack of sweet maltiness.
-This is rather svelte-bodied for a bock of this gravity.

What if you dig deeper?
-The advertised smoked malts havent participated much.
-Alcohol is ably concealed, which is always fun in these big brews.
-The vegetal pils malt character takes a little too much room for my tastes.
-There is a fun bock in here somewhere, but it just doesnt hit the spot for me.

4172,"2005-08-13",3.7,"I wasnt looking for a fancy beer tonight.  I had had a busy day taking my family to the new Dallas IKEA (just in its second weekend) and, while we had a great time, it was so busy--with three small kids, including a 2.5 month old baby.  So we enjoyed our Swedish meatballs and got some outraegeously cheap plastic cups for the kids, but in the traffic, heat, throng of people, and the like, I was ready for a beer.  And so I opened this bottle, a gift from Kevin.  It was bock-like but I treated it more of a solid brown ale, such was its depth of malts, which peaked with notes of caramel and nuts.  Very rich malts, rather sweet, engaging and extremely drinkable.  In fact, I drank it rather fast, with its notable body and moderate carbonation.  The rich nut-brown beer went down so easily, I had absolutely no idea it was pegged at 9% abv.  I dont believe it, at all.  A bottle of 9% should hit me at least a bit; this didnt do that.  And it had no flavor of alcohol.  So I cant comprehend that this was 9%.

4172,"2005-05-27",4.0,"Deep amber pour with creamy, off-white head that settles to a thick ring of lace - explosive aroma of caramel malt, smoke, hickory, some background alcohol - creamy, smooth mouthfeel - not overly sweet like a lot of higher alcohol bocks, in fact, its barely sweet at all - you can taste quite a bit of the smoked malt in this one, and it really gives the beer a very unique character - bready, doughy flavors mingle with a hint of spice and lingering hops - the alcohol is completely masked (I never would have guessed the ABV) - very nice indeed - many thanks to Crosling for this.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
4172,"2005-05-16",3.7,"12oz bottle.  Pours with slight film for a head, otherwise chesnutt brown colored beer.  Big malty aroma, along with carmel and just a touch of smoke buried below that thick sweet aroma.  Drinks like velvet, no alcohol bite, enough hops to prevent it from being clowingly sweet.  Pretty fun drinking beer, although I usually would think of a Maibock as lighter in color and body than this...this seems like a Doppel to me...but regardless of the lable, I like it.  Rich.","Nebraska, USA","mdi"
4172,"2005-05-16",3.8,"12 oz bottle. Rust colored with a medium sized head that didnt last long but left a nice trail of lace. Taste is nice and toasty with a sweet hoppiness. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel and finish.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
4172,"2005-04-26",4.2,"2005 bottle:  Very attractive looking reddish amber color with a totally retained off white head.  Aroma is rich sweet malt with a nice shot of smoke.  Malt aroma is right in there with the esteemed Celebrator.  Flavor is modertaly sweet malt, a bit of light chocolate, many layers of malty goodness with just a suggestion of smoke in the finish.  This is bock beer at its finest and it is shocking to find it being brewed in Fort Collins, CO.  Prost indeed!!!  Thank you, Ernest.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
4172,"2005-04-26",3.9,"Clear, near ruby colored liquid. Moderate light tan head. Much darker than I expected for a the moniker maibock. Malt monster aroma, with light fruit (peaches and raisins), hint of peat, mild herbs (rosemary, sage and thyme) all carried my honey roasted malts. Certainly an interesting smelling brew. Malted grain all over the place in this ones flavor. Malted milk with a dash on honey, light birch, dark chocolate. Late in the quaff the the rauch does come out and urges you to grab a smoked pork sausage. This one teeters on the edge of rauch, but it fits the bock style as well. I like this breweries embracing of smoked brew.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4172,"2005-04-22",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2005 According to everyone at the brewery this beer actually clocks in at 9% alcohol, making it much stronger that most Maibocks.  Not sure if it is actually 9% though.....Dark bronze color.  The aroma is fairly dry, herbaceous, loaded with malty goodness, particularly caramel and dark fruits, along with a touch of clove.  The flavor is extremely rich and loaded with malt variety.  Notes of caramel, toffee along with a tinge of alcohol and a dose of smoke on the finish.  Great mouthfeel.  The best beer I have ever had from this brewery, with the exception of their Smoked Doppelbock, which has yet to be bottled.  And for those of us in the know, the Smoked Doppelbock is hibernating in the tanks right now and should be ready by fall.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
4172,"2005-04-14",3.8,"Bottle. Pretty dark for a mai-bock. Beautiful deep burgandy color wih big, lacey, off-white head. The aroma is malty, with some plum notes and a lager crispness. Big and creamy. Nutty, malty, and caramelly. More like a dopplebock thn a mai-bock. It does finsh slightly dry which would put it more in line with a mai-bock. Kind of a cross-style beer, but I like it.","Brighton, Colorado, USA","snowtiger"
4172,"2005-04-13",3.3,"This miabock has a sweet malt, caramel nose with hints of plum and raisin.  Pouring it forms an off white tan, fine bubbled head which forms craters and lasts a descent amount of time.  This miabock is classic in color: a nice deep mahogany brown which hints at the rich malt flavor to come.  The spring bock taste similar to the smoked z lager from FCB with a kind of meaty smoked taste.  Once the beer warmed in my glass tones of plum, raisin and dark roasted malts came out with a touch of hops and a warming alcohol finish, warming the belly.  Has a nice sticky palate which enables you to enjoy the sweet malt characteristic after it is swallowed.  IT does not have a refreshing characteristic for those of you expecting a lighter summer beer.  It is rather a ballsy tasty beer meant for enjoying on a mild spring afternoon. (Boy, did that sound corny or what!)","Longmont, Colorado, USA","jigglyjock"
4172,"2005-04-12",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2005 Clear and deep burgundy with a yellow-beige head. Creamy and full mouthfeel. Sharply toasted, with notes of bitter chocolate, salty nuts, and lightly sweetened toffee. Big hop presence, with hints of grass, flowers, sour lemon, and a pinch of spruce, coated with a little smoke. Toasty bitterness in the aftertaste. Has a wholesome, homebrewed overtone, exuding with freshness. Really good beer. Tremendously well made.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
4172,"2005-04-11",4.6,"Top-notch maibock.  Color is a fiery red amber brown.  Head is booming and rising, about 2"" thick, tan and fluffy.  Aroma most prominently consists of bright caramel malts, ginger and oak wood barrels.  Excellent flavor and complexity - rich chocolate and caramel malts.  Tastes like the four months that it aged was done so in oak barrels.  Distinct nutty taste, most likely from the roasted malts.  Accents of prunes and oats.  Near perfect balance  harmonious marriage of malts and hops; creamy, with a nice solid weight.  Just the slightest hint of floral and citrus flavors come through from the hops, helping to substantiate this bock as a maibock, although some qualities are more in line with a doppel.  God bless what Ft. Collins has created here.  Cant taste or smell any hint of alcohol, but you know that its there by the spark on the throat and lightening of the head.  Thoroughly enjoyed.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4172,"2005-04-05",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2005 Thin white head, dark clear red color. Very typical sweet lager aroma, roasty and slightly smokey. Rich, full malty palate. Roasty, sweet, molassis in the taste. Only slightly bitter and herbal. Well lagered and easy drinking. 
ReRate: Great full malty mouthfeel, sticking texture. Whats so great about this beer is the long drawn out finish which is dry and starchy, yet still bitter and hinting at molassis.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
4172,"2005-04-01",2.8,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2010 2010 bottle.

Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark amber.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel, cookie, toasted grain), lightly  hoppy (apricot, grapefruit), with a note of gum.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Vague, light nose with little to offer. Kinda weird sourness, but its mild.  Never have cared for this one much.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4172,"2004-05-04",3.5,"The Maibock poured a hazy copper-orange with a creamy, off-white head that went down to a thin layer.

Its aroma was sweet caramel malt and some spicy smoke.

The taste was grassy, caramel malt initially with a smoke finish.  I thought it was a little too sweet.  The mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied.

Overall, I thought it was similar to their Marzen, but not quite as good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
