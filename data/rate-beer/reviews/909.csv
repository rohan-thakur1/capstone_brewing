909,"2016-04-18",3.8,"Shared with Strykzone on Facebook Chat. Poured a red amber with an off-white head. Nose of light fruits and some citrus. Malts. Medium body and a very soft smooth mouth feel. Flavor is malts, some fruit, the citrus and a tiny bit of nuts. The finish is oh so smooth and lightly bitter and the light fruits hang on. As Dave points out there is a hint of sulfur. The overall feel is like a cask pulled ale, something like an American version of an English Bitter. Really nice and easy drinking. Raises the California Common style to a new high for me.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
909,"2016-04-18",3.7,"Bomber from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Mid brown and a lot of sediment was loosened as the bottle was rolled resulting in a very hazy beer. The aroma is rich malts and sweet fruit. That is in the flavor, too. Some bitterness on the top side that is fruity and sulfury. It is kind of an American bitter. A hint of earth and tangerines at the finish. A lot here to make my taste buds happy.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
