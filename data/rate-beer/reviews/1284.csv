Just wasnt what I expected of an ESB. No dark fruits, no raisins, no malt. Plenty of bitterness (not a bad thing) and big piney, citrus aroma.

1284,"2008-02-04",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2010 Old brewery version. Hazy amber with a very dense head. Aroma is possibly the pineyest (not sure thats a word) of any Australian beer Ive had, but in a good way. Its all very well integrated with some nice, subtle, complementary esters and a chunky, fresh maltiness. The flavours are relatively indistinct and all on top of eachother, but in this case it works very well. Doesnt finish especially bitter but the hop flavour lingers through enough to easily keep me happy. Just a simple, fresh beer served in top condition - top stuff. Probably the best beer Ive had from Hargreaves Hill. (3.9)Red Hill version: Massive passionfruit hop aroma (later revealed to be Nelson Sauvin), hazy and loaded with young beer flavours - very much my style. Thick, chewy malt, suspended yeast carries fresh citrusy hop flavour and good solid bitterness with a touch of (hop?) acid. Tasty, but quite different to both Red Hills beers or the HH version.(3.8)New brewery version. Seems to have caught a mild case of boring. Hope its not terminal. Still a decent beer, but it seems the crystal malt has been upped significantly and the hops reduced. Still fairly hoppy, but not really any different to all the other hoppy Aus beers on the market, where it used to be utterly unique. (3.3)","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"
