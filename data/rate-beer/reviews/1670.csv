Overall, a very enjoyable, and well balanced stout. Will drink again.

1670,"2012-11-02",3.7,"(Draught) dark espresso brown, tan fine bubbled head. Nose of rich chocolate, herbal from the hops and chocolate combo, coffee, bold and rich. Taste is quite hoppy, bitter coffee notes, herbal/green, some plant like notes, bakers chocolate also. Nice and bold on flavor for a dry stout, a bit too much herbal notes from the hops, really close to the best dry stout Ive had even regardless of those facts.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
1670,"2012-10-30",3.8,"Super dark brown with a dense small bubble tan head. Lots of dry cocoa and earthy mineral in the aroma. The flavor is strong toasted malt. Body is a little thin. Palate is fizzy. No creaminess or milkiness like I was expecting. This ones a little thin and fizzy. 

On nitro this beer has a velvety head and cool, smooth creamy mouthfeel. The flavors are smoother and the harshness is gone. Rating reflects nitro version.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"
