Cerveja marrom escura. creme bege de média duração.

O sabor é amargo, com forte presença do lúpulo, doce do malte, frutas escuras. O amadurecimento revela uma presença de madeira e deixa o frutado cada vez mais em segundo plano, sobrando só o amargor e adstringência.

2388,"2016-06-02",3.4,"June 20th, 2014 - The writers back at Eviltwins Brewery are doing top notch work on these labels, setting an environment and attitude for the beer before the head is even pierced by a top lip. And once out, the aroma tumbles forward with all the classic double IPA scents, heavy and sweet, but leaning more towards pine and oak. It is even more robust than many double IPAs in my review archive, and I like it, strong but poised. The flavor is a little less balanced, with a much more bitter approach. The bitterness takes over after a quick puff of sweetness on the front, and stays there, slightly stronger with each sip. I would have preferred a slightly tweaked balance, but for $3.55 I am pleased.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Sweet aroma, caramelly, tinned peaches, including the tin. Nice dark red, tight tan head. Body is pure dark toffee. Sweet and sticky, so much caramel. Fairly pleasant for something so sweet, but still, an absurdly sweet amber ale. Does also have some of the metal in the bitter hopping.

Flavour also built around that quite sweet caramel body, and earthy, somewhat resinous pine hops. Citrus present but only lightly fruity, pith mostly, a little grapefruit flesh. Quite bitter from the middle on, pine persisting, some grain building, ending in a fairly dry and quite astringent finish. Medium, oily body with fairly high carb. I think this wasnt super fresh and so the fruit characters to complement the sweet caramel, grain and quite piney bittering hops had faded.

2388,"2014-04-17",3.8,"Bottled 2/18/14 and poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint on 4/17/14. $3 single, so its a reasonable price for an Evil Twin beer.

Appearance: Well. If you get the whole bottle in, say hello to a massive amount of huge floaters and some serious sediment. Very hazy color that looks like diarrhea water with all of the floaties. Nice and sustained three finger off-white soapy head. Looks rather unappealing with the color and floaters. I like the head on it though (Who doesnt like some good head!?).

Smell: Hop Flood indeed. Pure, ripe, sharp pine and grass hops with a lot of resinous smells. Some good caramel malt in there as well, but this is an amber? It really smells like an IPA to me. The only thing making me think otherwise so far is the appearance.

Taste/feel: Hm. Well. Yeah, hm... alright. I dont know. Interesting, I suppose. My immediate thought is that this beer has more bitterness than actual flavor. Theres a nice pleasant little rush of hops initially, maybe a trace of malt, and then a bitter, bitter, bitter finish. No idea what the IBUs are on this, but its gotta be high. The burps are tasting like straight up hop cones. Im not sure just why this is listed as an amber, because it really tastes nothing like an amber to me. Its hops through and through with an intense bitterness -- not much balance to speak of. Its a good beer, and an extreme one, but so is Molotov Cocktail... that beer from Evil Twin had some balance to it. The feel here is moderate all around with texture and carbonation.

All-in-all, disappointed, and probably my least favorite Evil Twin beer. The hops are bursting fresh and tasty, but wheres the malt? Going by the color of this beer and then the flavor, the amount of hops in this brew must be off the chart. Its a pretty good beer, but not what Id expect from Evil Twin (...greatness, basically).

2388,"2014-02-07",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2014 Just ok for me. Tried a sample on tap at Bohemian Bull. To be fair I did try it right after the Femme Fatale Brett IPA. Pours a sort of pale amber/ brown- totally transparet. Looks somewhat wimpy in the glass. Not much head or aroma. Taste is the malty/ bread you would expect with this style. Light mouthfeel Better finish than normal with an amber brown (read, some finish and balance- not all sweet). Just cant seem to get on board with this style. I should probably skip right over amber and go from Pale Ale to Porter. 
Better than I remember- on tap at Appalachian Vinter.  Like an amber with something to it- definite hop presence and decently weighted body.   Pours opaque reddish brown with decent head.   Malt and hops play nicely.   Really good beer for an average style.","","woodychevy"

2388,"2014-01-31",3.4,"12oz bottle. Bottled on Dec. 9, 2013. Pours a murky brown/amber hue, with partials, and a light khaki colored head. Very faint aromas of malt bread, caramel, and herbal hops when cold. Weak aroma. As promised though, a flood of hops fill the mouth. Flavors of pine and citrus rind dominate, with a good amount of lingering bitterness on the palate. Like chewing on marijuana. It definitely relieved my hop itch, though aroma was a big disappointment for the price. If your craving bitter hops in your mouth, this is worth trying... Good hoppy palate. Though if your looking for the complete package, with amazing hop aromatics, this beer is a pass.

Taste is of sweet fruits, caramel malts, bitter citrus fruits, tangy spicyness and some earthy pine ... with a brown sugar layer over everything. Sticky and bittersweet. Fairly thick and certainly chewy. Interesting blend of tastes; showing components of an ipa, an american strong ale and a scotch ale. Some alcohol presence, although it is not a key part.

Strong bitterness coming from the resin and roast.  Also, the whole time I was drinking the beer I had an annoying roasted meaty sensation that was somewhat reminiscent of a BBQed red meat, not something Im looking for in a beer.
