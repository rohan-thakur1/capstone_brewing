1088,"2011-08-30",4.1,"[Polypin at the Three Crowns, Chippenham] Cloudy, very pale gold.  Vinegary aroma - but good quality vinegar.  In the mouth its one of the smoothest drinks Ive ever tasted.  Sweet eating apples, vanilla and soft creamy pears come through, just kept wanting to taste this over and over again.  Amazingly tasty, amazingly more-ish.  No sourness, and little dryness, yet somehow manages to avoid being oversweet.  Fantastic stuff - restored my interest in perry after a previous bad experience.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"
