1230,"2016-10-12",4.1,"Wow, my first rating for a doppelbock in more than five years. 750 bottle purchased just over three years ago at Holiday Wine Cellar ($13.99). POURS a hazed brown color with notable reddish highlights and two fingers of khaki foam. AROMA of rich caramel, dusty grains, raisins, brown sugar, with just a bit of chocolate. Wonderfully complex FLAVOR of more rich/smooth caramel and toffee, oxidized notes, stewed or candied dark fruits (raisins, figs), butterscotch, roasted nuts, sherry/port, honeyed toast, brown sugar, and a hint of chocolate at the end. Really smooth on the palate...somehow the high ABV is utterly utterly concealed here. Not sure how much sitting in the cellar for three years has enriched this beer, but the results in 2016 are excellent. (109, 1045)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

1230,"2015-11-29",3.4,"Pours a slightly hazy dark chestnut brown color with dark apricot edges and a one finger off-white head that quickly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind.

Slightly spicy aroma with chocolate, banana and faint malty sweetness. Pepper and clove followed by caramel, chocolate covered banana and toffee. Theres a touch of vinous fruit in there as well.

Medium body with slight creamy texture and a nice balance of earthy spice and chocolate and caramel malt sweetness. Hints of clove and ground pepper with faint piney hop bitterness countered by caramel malt, toffee and chocolate. Bready yeast presence with some banana and bubblegum with a spicy dry finish. Decently balanced and very easy to drink. Subtle alcohol heat in the finish but overall the 10% ABV is very well masked. Not overly complex but this is another enjoyable beer from AleSmith.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1230,"2014-09-05",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2014 ""Up until 2012 (quad) the Decadence releases from Alesmith had been an ever so slight letdown. Not that they werent good. They were good. Very good. But for an anniversary release from one of the best brewers on the planet, I wanted them to be elite, and they always fell juuuust a little short of that. Til last year. They nailed the quad. Its one of the best in style Ive ever had. And now, I can say the same for the Doppelbock. This stuff is a no frills but EXTREMELY well made brew. Notes of fresh baked bread, caramel, toffee, light spices and yeast hit your nose and your palate and keep you coming back for more.

With time the light stone fruit seems to get more towards raisin/date. The malt is nicely toasty/bready. Maybe a hint of toffee. There seems to be a tendency for the flavors to mutate.

1230,"2013-10-22",3.9,"Bottle; Pour is dark mahogany with a two finger, fine bubbled khaki head in this glass. Retention is modest , with light lacing in this dimpled mug. The nose is nutty, cream, caramel malt, with a touch of booze. Oh. a 10% doppelbock? Alright. The flavor profile has a stunning initial feeling - creamy caramel nutty malts coming through heavily with an unmatched mouthfeel. Its perhaps overly sweet, and lacking in the more German side of the hop profile. Sweet bread, with toast, birch, and a hint of vanilla; god damn - this is good right now","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

1230,"2013-10-12",4.2,"Been out the game for awhile now, or so it would seem. I may have ticked some outrageously rare stuff between then and now, but the world will never know. To tantalize and titillate my many fans (just kidding, there are exactly zero such people), Im going to review this extremely rare beer that I traded a Dave for. This beer has an appearance on par with Kate Upton (apologies to my wife). It has a deep crystal-clear amber color and a lasting, lacy two-finger pale khaki head. Damn dude. Smells pretty spot-on, bready with toasted caramel notes. One sip reveals the doppelness of this bock. This beer has no qualms about asserting itself as a 10% bruiser thats going to make your night interesting. The flavor is delicious and complex. Caramel, toffee, candied raisins, and chocolate flavors round out a sweetness that goes exactly as far as youd want it to and no more. The MFing MF (MouthFeel) is so MFing MF (MagniFicent) that you might start to MF (Ma*******e Furiously).

1230,"2013-10-12",4.0,"750 ml bottle from Piccadilly market in Poway. Pours a translucent amber-brown color with a beige head that quickly dissipates away with an audible hiss. The aroma is light in strength with cola, toffee and spiced persimmons. The taste is nutty, with filberts, almonds and walnuts set in a toffee-ish malt base. The palate is full and viscous to the point of almost being chewy and the carbonation is soft. Finishes medium in duration and dry with a bit of a greasiness. Overall: First rate stuff, very tasty. I loved it--anyone want a bottle? PM me, first two persons to do so get some. Paired very well with some Cabots Vermont sharp cheddar and unsalted mixed nuts.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

The beer is dark amber, but despite its darkness is not cloudy. The aroma is not intense but is more than adequate and provides rich notes of carmel, honey, and dark baked bread. The taste is amazing having a slight slight hop bitterness mixed with a little burnt carmel bitterness. The main component of the taste comes from the substantial malt backbone, providing tastes of chocolate, honey, and dark baked bread. The palate has medium body and slightly sticky. The finish provides lingering light sweetness of carmel and chocolate. I am going to purchase as much of this beer as I can get!
