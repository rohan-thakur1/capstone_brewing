442,"2017-04-22",3.7,"My bottle says this is a ginjo but its Well of Wisdom for sure. Sweeter nose of melons and light pepper. Tastes of watermelon, coconut husk, rice, white pepper Simple and tasty.","New York, USA","Jow"
442,"2015-04-30",2.8,"This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of frothy medium sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was nail polish. The vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering vinous aftertaste. The OK flavor contained notes of semi-sweet nail polish plastic and vinous alcohol. An OK sake just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
442,"2014-07-10",3.4,"Very mild, honeydew and nail polish. Crystal clear. Clean koji flavor, subtle violet and plum accents, honey dew base. Alcohol pretty well masked for a sake. Complexities without assaulting the palate. Could use a bit more oomphf.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
442,"2014-03-29",2.4,"Bottle served chilled. Clear, white wine like appearance. Aroma of white wine. Not sure what Im tasting here. Tastes like apple juice / white wine. Palate is thin, slight alcohol burn. Not sure about this saki stuff. Ill stick to beer.","Houston, Texas, USA","DrunkSanta410"
442,"2013-07-16",3.3,"750ml bottle, served chilled. Nearly colorless, translucent body. Just a slight hue of yellow. Pretty nice, ricey, more potent aroma. Like rice pudding. Medium-plus body, a relatively light body compared to beer of this strength. No carbonation. Moderate sweet taste, some alcohol warmth. Ive never been much of a sake aficionado, but this seems like one of the finer sakes Ive tasted (and my first honjozo). A delicate, well-integrated flavor, with a nice rice pudding finish. Sweet, but not cloying, with a good lighter body.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
442,"2012-01-26",2.9,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is light yellow. Aroma is notes of grain/rice, alcohol, mold, light note of melon rind. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/silky texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.  Overall ordinary.  More color than most.  Very plain, typical sake aroma of wet rice and old moldy shoes.  Decent flavor balance.  It just doesnt stand out in any way.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

442,"2009-05-03",3.4,"Clear and still.  slightly squash-like and marzipan nose. hard palate, bitter alcohol finish...tingly funky bite at the onset but settles into a nicely complex nutty aftertaste...though still a bit hot and lingering.  Certainly NOT clean and smooth yet pleasantly complex at the same time.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
442,"2008-05-28",3.2,"Bottle: Pours a golden hue with a light greenish essence through the light. Nice quaint legs and a sturdy looking body. The nose is dry with a smug light koji note and some faint butter and almond notes. The flavor has nearly no alcohol impact with a light doughy mouthfeel, some butter and banana notes with light melon and maple. Not that clean, but not dry and harsh with the koji like most. Very light alcohol bite too. Nice honjozo.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
442,"2008-03-23",3.4,"720 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (February 2008) served chilled from a White Winter Winery glass.  Pale yellow-gold, clear and still; like a very light white wine....lovely mild coconut-almond, vaguely ricey nose, no alcohol detected at first, faint floral notes....the body is moderately sweet, lightly alcoholic, becoming semi-dry and lightly bitter/harsh at the finish; a touch buttery-cookieish, just a bit syrupy....very full and perhaps even ""heavy"", a bit much to make drinking a whole bottle feasable, but on the whole a pretty decent sipper.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
442,"2008-01-31",2.4,"The aroma has anise, coconut, rice, and alcohol. The appearance is clear. The flavor is like the aroma with a strong alcohol presence. The palate is watery. Overall its warming and yet cool.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
442,"2008-01-31",2.2,"I actually like this one because even though there is no aroma, it has a strong flavor of ricey alcohol and grain flavor. drinkable for the casual get together.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
442,"2007-11-13",3.5,"Bottle 500ml from Party Source served cold. Poured clear pale color with good legs. Medium melon sweet rice and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a dry texture. Medium complex tangy flavor with a medium sweet alcohol burn finish that was of moderate duration. Solid drinkable sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
442,"2007-08-15",3.6,"Courtesy of the local Vine Source rep Jason at a tasting.  Clear watery appearance with almost no colorw.  Sweet rice aroma with the faintest scent of plums.  Similar taste with a watery finish.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
442,"2007-08-03",3.8,"Sampled at The Cellars Wine & Spirits wine tasting. Pours a clear white sake, with no color. Aroma of light spring flower, vanilla, and a touch of fresh cracked almonds. Taste is light, semi-fruity, crisp with a vanilla and steamed long grain rice flavor. Finish is semi-dry and a lingering steamed rice aftertaste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
442,"2007-04-15",4.0,"Pours clear and still.  Smells of vanilla, rice, some sweetness and booze in a complimentary way.  Taste is crisp with rice, some caramel, vanilla, some spicy tinges.  Mouthfeel is buttery and palatable.  Finish is very smooth and soothing.  More thick and flavorful than most of the other sakes Ive tried.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
442,"2007-04-06",3.4,"Poured still, yellow tint, wouldnt hang to the glass if I tried. Aroma of almonds, vanilla, buttercream, and meringue.  Taste was sweet initially, with toffee, and some melon, vanilla, koji, cinnamon, and the dry riciness really came through in the end.  Alcohol was noticed and fairly strong.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
442,"2007-03-08",3.5,"Pour is lightly yellowed and clear...smell is strong and perfumey...lots of flowers, alcohol, indeed light fruits and melons...sweet and very light...alcohol seems more apparent (obviously) than in a junmai, but still seems deceptively light...hints of almond...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
442,"2007-03-08",3.8,"Cool, balanced and full-bodied, with suggestions of melon.  Much better tasting than the modest price would suggest.","USA","ldr514"
