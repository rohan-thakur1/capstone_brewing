2735,"2016-03-21",3.4,"Bottle from Uba ja Humal in Tallinn ( 4.70). So... A lager with catnip... Thats a first. Pours slightly hazy yellow with a good creamy white head. The aroma is definitely herby, grassy, sweet - rather attractive to be honest. Would be hard pressed if I had to guess the exact ingredient. At first I got more APA-like floral and soapy notes than catnip though. Tastes sweet and bitter, with the herby catnip definitely giving it some uniqueness (it kinda reminds me of some of the juniper beers Ive had). Slickish on the palate with moderate carbonation, good drinkability. I quite like it despite the grassy-herbal harshness now and then, and its kinship to an APA.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"
2735,"2016-02-16",2.8,"330ml bottle - Thanks Kairi!
Sweet floral lager aroma. Taste sweet and floral too, but also a bit floury too. Zingy citrussy hops, sweet and sherbetty. Some almondy plasticky aspects, but not unpleasant. Quite an unusual lager, definitely characterful.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
