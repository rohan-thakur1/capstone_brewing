3195,"2017-04-16",2.7,"Pours a murky golden with a sudsy white head. The head fades very quickly. Mildly tart nose. The mouthfeel is soft, then faintly astringent, then becoming more soft and wet. Bready and faintly spicy flavors.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"

Grassy and wet hay.Taste is malty and slightly bitter. Tobacco. Biscuity, Tobacco.Mouthfeel is light. Smooth, crisp, dry. Tobacco. Dank hops.Overall, this is an odd one. I like it, but it has no real goal. I dont know if I would recommend it, but I enjoy it enough that I would buy it again.","Arkansas, USA","beer_rookie"

3195,"2016-05-26",3.7,"Can, advance sample. Pours a very clear dark gold with a shallow lacy white head; its a product photographers dream beer. Nose is lemon, tangerine, honey, and biscuity malt. On the tongue, it starts out sweet, but not cloyingly so -- then weighs in with a substantial, weighty body with notes of honey, filbert, and biscuit. I even pick up a little baking spice. This is a lager with gravitas, but it remains refreshing and clean. The mouthfeel is beautiful. Some stone fruit on the finish. Well done.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"

3195,"2015-06-02",3.0,"Pleasant light lager. Faint aroma of pale/Pilsner malt. Color of ginger ale with a minimal head. Medium weight. Nice flavor of malt with a touch of lager yeast and a woodsy essence. Good with chicken tacos.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"
