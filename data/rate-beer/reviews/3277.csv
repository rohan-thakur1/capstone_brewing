3277,"2014-12-25",2.9,"This is not a tripel.
This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a nice looking hazy amber to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light lacing roaming here and there around the glass. 
The smell had a nice real authentic citrus to spicy rye. A light rye malt enters in as it warms.
The taste was mainly sweet but had a light spicy rye to the flavor. A nice light sweet rye aftertaste accompanies the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Id say that the carbonation was good for me and for the style. Overall, I say this was a pretty good rye beer. This is not a tripel, theres nothing that tells me it has the characteristics of a tripel in the smell and taste.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, lightly prickly, and fairly acidic mouthfeel that is nice.

Despite being an immediate gusher this was another excellent production from Jolly Pumpkin. Throwing rye into a tripel did not create some strange novelty. Instead this, kind of like rye IPAs, sets itself apart while retaining the characteristics of a beer true to style.

Aroma / Appearance - After the foam settled the glass was full of caramel bronze liquid. The bubbly foam never really settled 100% but instead left a layer of frosting. Graham crackers, caramel, pretzels, sourdough bread, and rye all contribute to a thick and sweet experience.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy with a tickle of spices this is not subtle. The full bodied mouthfeel contains within a blend of yeast, rye, caramel, and bittersweet chocolate. The long lasting finish gives plenty of time for reflection as well. A well rounded release is definitely a winner if you want something different than your average tripel.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Flavor begins with rye and a fairly-heavy phenolic presence. A bit of rye in the background, as well as a touch of bread. Body is light, dry, and crisp. A bit bitter. 

Very mild touch of bubblegum in the nose as it warms.

Probably a bit past its prime, and ages different than most Jolly Pumpkin beers. Im not sure what the design was, but this doesnt have any oak, funk, or acidity. As a plain tripel, its not bad, but it isnt anything noteworthy either.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

Taste is crunchy grainy pale malts, very rustic/barnyard, a bit bretty/leathery, rye presence is very discreet, fruity notes of pears.  Finishes dry.  Drinks more like a big Saison than a Triple per say.  I really liked that beer.  The Beaudelaire series is far from the usual JP signature funky beers but they are just as good.

S: A wonderful spice note is present right away, that seems to be the rye with maybe a hint of pepper or just some yeasty esters. A light funkiness along with some citrus zest and a hint of green fruits.

T: The rye and yeast esters provide a really great spice note along with some bready malts that are the base of this beer. A gentle funk character with some hay and straw, and a great dry, bretty quality. A lightly tart lemon flavor and some hints of green apple.

There are lots of parallels: orange color, fruity aroma, bretty flavor, bone dry finish, high-but-soft carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot-on Orval. Really not much in the tripel department.

Thick, solid sheets of lace are well pronounced, clinging hard to the glass.  The first whiff draws a smile, as it reveals that familiar, comforting, and unmistakable JP funk.  Further contemplation shows notes of spicy rye grain, peppery lemon peel, light coriander, and ultra-dry, fruity, spicy yeast.  Flavors show more of the same, again quite spicy with notes of pepper, lemon peel, caraway, and rye grain, all enveloped in the standard woody, bretty house yeast.  The palate is very dry, crisp, and parching, which is a welcome departure from standard tripel fare.  Very nice brew.

3277,"2010-02-21",3.6,"750mL bottle at Woodshop 5.0, courtesy of cloudskipper. Thanks, Chris! POurs a murky, deep yellow color; medium-bubbled off-white head with good retention and solid lacing. Nicely bretty aroma, lots of complex esters and yeast character here; crackers, toasty, hints of alcohol. Medium body: creamy presence in the mouth; following the nose: lots of creamy yeast, crackers, well-developed / non-acidic brett character; a very toasty, Belgian-style beer; solidly bretty. Lasting dry finish: toasty, hints of grains, lingering crackers; nicely dry.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
3277,"2010-02-13",3.3,"Pours a murky darker amber, a huge cakey offwhite head that laces excellently, wont die. Aromas are a nice melange of floral and citrusy hops, a touch of mellow rye malts, the hops take hold with a decent funky brett quality, a touch of Belgian spice. Fruity. Initial is medicinal, some fruity esters and a faint spice, vanilla, with a decent funky brett, bubblegum amoxicillan, lighter on the palate, the rye seems to conflict with the beer. A touch of boozy heat, very belgian slanted, with some light funk and sweet esters. Interesting, a touch of amoxicillan kids liquid, nuts, fruits, slightly sweet malts. Ok. Interesting is the key word with this brew.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3277,"2010-02-13",3.4,"Ale absurd... Pours a cloudy orange caramel brown with a hefty soapy white head... Aroma of earthy sweet and medicinal spiciness as well as orange peel... Flavors of lively and spritzy earth and citrus. Little too dry and effervescent","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
3277,"2010-02-13",3.1,"750ml, pours hazy auburn with white head. Nose of cookie, rye, herbs, and phenolic. flavors of rye, caramel, spicy yeasty, medicinal. Spritzy carb. Odd brew.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3277,"2010-02-08",4.1,"Gusher bottle.  Pours a hazy golden color with a MASSIVE, rocky white head.  The aroma is a nice blend of spice, banana, clove, damp wood, slight black pepper and that distinct Jolly Pumpkin funk.  The flavor is bold and spicy with the rye pepperyness standing out much more than the aroma.  The Belgian esters and oak aging blend to make a nice luscious earthy fruit character with hints of banana creme and clove.  The body is creamy and quite full and that massive amount of carbonation comes across quite soft and smooth.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","punkrkr27"
3277,"2010-01-06",3.8,"The cap comes off safely enough, but I get this into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip and end up with seven fingers of foam that continuously spews foam over the sides.  Finally settles down enough to take away from the sink and I have a picturesque tall head that sits about an inch above the rim of my glass.  In the bottle the beer was actually pretty clear, but after pouring, the beer is a reddish, darkish amber hue that shows a hazed, pink-orange, amber hue when held up to the light.  As the head slowly subsides it leaves a nice, layered, lacing pattern on the sides of my glass and the head is very structure forming mesas that have quite some staying power.  Visually, you cant ask for much more from a beer of this type.  The aroma is musty with a woody peppery note, a faint tartness (a touch of lemon perhaps) and a grassy-earthy grain note that dominates the finish.  Very rustic and earthy smelling, but also bone dry smelling, this is a very nice smelling beer.

Light, a touch fizzy (it has sat long enough in my glass that it has loss much of the excess carbonation) and it has a dry, grassy grain finish as well as a touch of phenolic clove and a very faint tartness (much of which could just come from the wheat).  There are some light apple and pear notes here, but this is dry enough of a beer that it is very subtle.  Earthy, slightly musty notes perhaps signal a touch of Brettanomyces character, but this is very faint and only at the beginning stages of funkification.  There is a very grounded, earthy, woody pepper note here that is only lightly spicy.  The malt actually almost has a savoriness to it that is brought out by the dryness; there is a nice pale grain cracker note, a touch of hay and some freshly threshed wheat notes.  Much of the spiciness is from the wild fermentation character (even if it is a touch tame); there is definitely quite a bit of phenolics in this beer, it is a touch clove like, but mostly a bit plastic like, or even a touch solvent like, butt this last is definitely quite faint.  The oak plays a definite supporting role here, it is almost hard to even recognize underneath the steady, earthy funkiness, but it does accentuates a light, overall spiciness, the touch of woody character, as well as some tannic astringency towards the finish.  The texture of this beer is definitely light, this is a beer meant to be quaffed, but it doesnt come off as being overly thin as there is a touch of malt viscosity to this brew; some of the oak derived tannins also contribute a bit to the weight of this brew.

This has the perfect amount of funkiness to be classified as a Farmhouse ale; the funk lightly accentuates the rustic grain and yeast-fermentation character.  This is a Farmhouse ale for the late spring or early Autumn as it is a touch more malty and textured than a pale, light Summer Saison.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3277,"2010-01-03",3.7,"750 ml bottle.  Foggy orange brown with a lacy off-white head.  Poured out  half the bottle into two glasses before the foaming settled down.  Wild stuff.  Nose is yeast and lemon candy with floral hints.  Medium light with prominent sudsy carb.  Taste is hay, lemon peel, melon and apricot.  Finishes with peach pit and lime zest.  Crisp and very sessionable.  Really good farmhouse brew.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3277,"2009-12-01",3.7,"750mL Bottle. Aroma is a spicy amalgam of mulled cider, cooked coconut and seared pineapple, light, tropically floral and spicy. Carbonation furiously mixes a murky orange liquid beneath a fluffy, quite tall pear-flesh-colored head. The flavor is funky and unique. Heavily herbal and a bit meaty, with some sharp spiciness. Hard to parse and very muddled. Some fig paste, white cumin, sandalwood, incense, dried maple leaves, and white grape must. Sharp on the tongue and a bit alcoholic. A bite of generic hop bitterness hits me on the way down. The finish produces a half sweet/half savory spice and herb finish that lingers. While Im incredibly grateful to have an opportunity to try this, Im not sure its JPs finest effort.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3277,"2009-11-24",3.5,"Bottle at the Brewpub. Poured a hazy amber with a huge yellowish eggshell head. Aroma was full of sour notes with undertones of floral and sweet fruits. Flavor began sour with a lemony flavor, but transitioned in to more of a rye hoppy flavor for the finish. Very dry on the the tongue. The transition in the flavor is a bit awkward, but other than that, a good beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3277,"2009-10-16",4.2,"Bottle.   Pours a very hazy copper color with a humongous white head.   The head looks like egg whites beat to stiff peaks.   Aroma is floral, yeasty, some barnyard notes, lemon zest, oak.   Flavor is peppery hops, floral notes, lemon zest, some citrus, more oak.   Palate is medium light, highly carbonated, finished tart, dry, and bitter.   Another great one from Ron.","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"
