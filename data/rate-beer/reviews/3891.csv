3891,"2016-11-10",3.8,"Draft on tap at the Brewpub  (Santa Rosa, CA). Pours a hazy dulled golden amber hue, a touch darker, some gentle orange flashes with lively bubbly cascades. Cakey, creamy off white head atop is sizable, firm with solid lacing. Aromas are a bit dulled, pithy and citric grapefruit meet deadened florals, earth, clean malty appeal. Almost an herbal touch, more grapefruit. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body, a bit cereal, bready with green least hops, white grape and citrus leading out. Some firmer bitter appeal. A touch of honeycrisp, soap, earthy bitter appeal grows. A bit bitter, fruity, sweet for what I was expecting. Flecks of pineapple, grape, tropical waft. Backend is bitter, dry, cleaning up a bit overall. Nothing potent but fairly hoppy, this one drinks easy enough even at 7% ABV. More deadened nose, pretty pour, nice flavors and flow.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3891,"2013-10-04",4.1,"On tap at the brewpub.
Aroma is obviously dominated by hops with strong grapefruit character, with lesser amounts of tropical fruit and pine resin. Faint malt aroma with a nice cracker note to it.
Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange with some light copper notes. Small white head that exhibits nice retention and very nice lacing.
Flavor has a moderately sweet light cracker malt character to it. The cracker notes recede fairly quickly but the sweetness remains throughout. Medium tropical fruit notes with lots of grapefruit and lighter pine resin character. Moderately high bitterness with a surprisingly dry finish. Lingering grapefruit, pine resin and bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly soft and creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Low hop astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very nice hop forward IPA with some sweetness to balance and add body without detracting from the hop flavors.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

This beer appears a very clear light orange hue. There is a substantial white head that leaves a generous amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is very similar to Pliny the Elder.

Orange creamsicle aroma with nice mango fragrances and vanilla, maybe some grapefruit. Sweet hop flavors of orange and pineapple that fade into an almost tannic tea leaf note with bitter grapefruit. Fits the mold of all the great IPAs: derives its sweetness from hops, not malt. Nice resiny finish with plenty of bitterness to pad the drinkability, which is already dangerous.

Light gold body with a foamy white head.  The aroma is a pungent mix of pineapple, pine and bright, sweet lemons.  The hops intense and refuse to relent in the slightest.  It tastes much less bitter than the aroma would suggest and is actually quite drinkable.  Dry.  Feel suffers ever so slightly from the nonstop onslaught of hops.  Excellent IPA.

3891,"2010-08-13",3.7,"Growler from Russian River. Listed at 7%, if Im not mistaken. Pours a bright, modestly clear, golden-copper color; significant, fine-bubbled off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Significant oranges, pine, and citrus hop character in the aroma; very quiet malt character at the core (light candied oranges, melded with the hop character), and a minimal yeast contribution; this is, per usual, head-on, well-rendered hoppy goodness; resiny, juicy, nothing rough; seems like a rather strong Amarillo contribution. Medium to medium-full body; modest carbonation; generally smooth and non-astringent presentation; following the aroma, lots of orange, pine, and citrus (mild grapefruit, mostly lemon) hoppiness upfront and throughout: resiny, modestly juicy, nothing rough here; again, the malt core and yeast contributions are quiet, with just a bit of the toasty maltiness showing through with any prominence; overall, this is lacking compared to something like Blind Pig and PtE, and maybe its (alleged, by me) the more prominent focus on Amarillo-like hopping here, which is oily and smooth, but lacks a sufficient bittering contribution and doesnt quite fill things out; normally I love Amarillo, but it leaves a bit of open space here, compared to Vinnies other hoppy goodness.

3891,"2009-08-23",3.8,"Big thanks to Robert for breaking this one out at a recent tasting.

The growler opens with an impressive pop and then pours a clear golden orange with a small soapy off-white head that leaves spotty lacing and sticks around as a collar.

The aroma is big and juicy - with tons of grapefruit, oranges, lemons on the citrus side but with a definite PtE-like floral presence.  The malt sweetness is present in the background but its really all about the sweet, juicy hops.

The taste starts out with some sweetness from the citrus with grapefruits and oranges up front.  The caramel malts form a solid backbone to balance the hops and the floral pine bitterness finishes things off and leaves a slightly resinous taste on the palate.  

The mouthfeel is sticky with hops and had impressive carbonation given its a growler.  Its probably on the lighter side of things as in terms of body but in a good way and makes for massive drinkability.

Well, theres no doubt that Vinnie can make one hell of an IPA and this is no exception.  Well balanced with lots of citrus and floral hops and exceptionally drinkable.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Soft and rounded with lots of fruit in the flavor.   Dry and light in the malt department, with a light body.   The flavor is almost pure fruity hops, with no harshness or obtrusive bitterness.   Not really like their other IPAs, and maybe only similar to sculpin in its profile.   The spec sheet said 72 IBUs, but the bitterness is so smooth that you hardly even notice it.   The amarillo hops add a really nice dimension to the aroma, with the mango and peach components coming through over the more citric notes you might expect from the cascade and centennial that are also used.   Definitely another standout addition to the RR IPA lineup, and a unique one.   Probably tied with Kern River for the best IPA of the festival.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"
