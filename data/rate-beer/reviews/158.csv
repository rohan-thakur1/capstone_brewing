158,"2015-11-14",4.1,"330 ml bottle from Gallaghers Beer World/El Irlandés. This is one of the darkest beers Ive seen. Pitch black pour with a small-medium light brown and creamy head that lingers. An intensely aromatic brew with a huge roasted and malty backbone that opens up some space for shiny hoppy touches. Notes of bitter chocolate, whole-grain dark bread, rye, toasted cereal grains, pecan nuts, peanuts, pistacchio, Pumpernickel bread, loads of Moccha, and some indistinguishable but very present ""green"", hoppy hints. Impressive and characterful. Taste starts somewhat sweet and bready but thats quickly replaced by really potent roastiness mid-way through, ending with strong (though not overwhelming) astringent bitterness and more massive roastiness. Flavors continue to unveil with warming, revealing high alpha-acids as well as more Moccha coffee-ish touches. Almost extreme on both sides (malt/hops) so, that means its quite well balanced. Incredibly intense throughout the whole experience!... Medium body but it feels thicker due to the amounts of flavor. Perfect medium carbonation. Alcohol warms up but its not noticeable in the taste nor aroma. Long roasty aftertaste. A challenging sipper, not an easy drinking one.

158,"2015-09-26",4.0,"7.4%ABV. Porter.

Poured ouf of the bottle a very promising sludgy black producing a thin khaki brown head. A very enticing 40ºSRM. A color standard for all porters to aspire to, methinks.

The nose is full of light sweet flavors that reminiscent of cotton candy and leche espana. There are beautiful caramel, toffee, butterscotch and espresso like aromas.

The palate is ponderous with deeply roasted dark malt flavors in spades. Not like a traditional English porter because it is more agrressively carbonated as well as having a deeper, maltier, more black bread like experience. Porters are supposed to be heavier, but this is broader, deeper and more flavorful than a traditional porter, likely because traditional porters likely couldnt afford what it costs to brew this behemoth of an ale!

There is a nice clean carbon-sweet finish, like the burnt ends off a hunk of perfectly grilled char siew or bakkwa. So very familiarly inviting, and seductively engaging.

158,"2015-06-06",4.0,"Mikkellers (robust) porter, one of their many beers made in Belgiums Proefbrouwerij (bur originally at Amager, I heard) and one of the true Mikkeller classics, I assume. Opaque jet black beer (but revealing it is actually an extremely dark ruby bronze in the last drops), under a thick and very stable, very regularly shaped, frothy, heavily and almost sabayon-like lacing, utterly dense and cappuccino-like, reddish beige head. Pleasant aroma of toasted bread, bitter chocolate, Cuban cigars, smoked bacon, subtle espresso, bayleaf, vanilla, home made caramel, fresh nettles, gooseberries, hazelnuts, cloves, grapefruit peel, Irish coffee, wood ashes, dried ginger, iron but in a natural kind of way, cream and dried plums. Taste begins quite intense, a condensed candied fruit sweetishness but subtly so, gentle sourish accent (lemon zest), soft carbonation, creamy, fatty mouthfeel, thick caramelly, nutty and chocolatey malts with amusing spicy notes dancing above, slight metallic tone but not disturbing, leading to a satisfying finish of roasted black coffee-like bitterness, peppery and leafy hop bitterness, some residual caramelly sweetishness and a subtly dosed portion of booze, in the form of warming, bourbon-like alcohol which does not become too intrusive at any point. Very well balanced, tasty, juicy black beer, creamy and flawless, but perhaps a bit too black and roasted to be a true porter - if you told me this is a stout, I would accept that just as easily.

158,"2014-03-22",3.8,"Now this is one porter to be an example. Strange cause it has no huge advantages compared with other buddies from style but it is what porter should be to me - intense dark malts both aroma and flavor, to me it seems roasted malts dominant, even some burnt touch. Black it pours with dark brown, thick top. Not so malt sweetness oriented as stouts, but still has malt bill in front of all other aspects, seems hopped also richfuly cause overall bitterness is high. What I liked that it was more than medium bodied, thick-full mouthfeel, average dry finish. Very decent.","Ogre, LATVIA","zenkis"

Jedno z ciekawszych piw z Mikkellera, które miałem okazję próbować. Lubię portery za ich kawowo czekoladowe akcenty, niestety mam wrażenie, że ostatnio zanikają one na rzecz stoutów (zwłaszcza imperialnych), które stały się bardzo modne. Dlatego też wykorzystuję każdą okazję na zakup portera - zwłaszcza w wersji mocniejszej. Tutaj mamy do czynienia z bardzo dużym kawowym uderzeniem i to zarówno w aromacie, jak i smaku. Może nie jest to do końca ten rodzaj kawy, który bym chciał (zbyt wytrawna), ale nie jest źle. Piwo zdecydowanie do spokojnego sączenia, zwłaszcza, że cena za tą przyjemność jest dość wysoka. Mimo tego polecam.","Z±bki, POLAND","tomekk1978"

FINALLY, a good Mikkeller beer.  I expected this to be another drain pour, but thats definitely not the case.  I must assume this is because this was brewed at Amager instead of the abysmal De Proef.  Indeed, thats the only reason I bought this, and thankfully its surprisingly good.  Rich malt character, very coffee-ish and enticing.  Reminds me a bit of Amagers own Rye Porter, in fact.  None of the usual dirty De Proef off notes, quite clean and enjoyable to drink.  Its ultimately too expensive and sweet-and-boozy for me to buy again, but I quite enjoyed this.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Pours dark, and with a brief tight tan head that settles to a ring. Some clear estery spikes immediately after pouring, not so fruity, more solventy, but not in a particularly bad way, I wish I could think of a better word than solvent. On settling, the aroma becomes mashier, almost oatmealy, but of source strongly pointing in the roasted direction. In the mouth, immediately the same esters come over quickly with quite a kick up the back of the mouth and nose. Roast follows swiftly afterwards. Fairly pleasant rich roast, but alas an ashy burntness takes over and dominates. Some nice full-flower hops, I wouldnt be surprised if they were english, as theyre quite dry and earthy, perhaps a bit nettley too. However, that could just be the effect of the burntness. Smooth palate, pleasant carbonation. Alcohol restrained, but still noticeable. Too ashy for my taste, drinkability not so high. Felt Id had enough of it after 100ml, but certainly didnt want to waste it. Anna doesnt get is so burnt, but does get more alcohol, and more chocolatiness. Later sips show off the hops a bit better, quite a zingy spiciness coming across in the mouth. Pretty OK, but Id never exchange any BGB for one of these. Stop Press: as it warms (one QI episode later), there are more hops, and the body becomes sweeter, and that pushes the ashiness back quite a bit. So I do actually like having this in my mouth, and will pop the palate from 3 to 4.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

158,"2012-05-11",3.9,"16.9 ounce bottle.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch frothy tan head.  The head retention and lacing are both pretty good.  The brew smells like roasted malt, anise, molasses, dark fruit, and some coffee and chocolate.  It tastes like roasted malt, anise, dark fruit (mostly grapes), molasses, nuts and coffee.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and smooth and pretty easy to drink.  I think its a good overall porter, although I think its fruitier than most porters Ive had.  Id pick this one up again.  $9.99 a bottle at Party Town.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

158,"2012-03-30",3.9,"Bottle picked up at Drowlands old stomping grounds, the Cedar Falls Hy-Vee Wine and Spirits, I assume this odd and awesome availability is the work of HeyKevin, Mikkeller on shelves in Cedar Falls... never thought Id see the day. 

Pours black with a big tan head that fades to a small tight head that manages to leave a nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is roasty and woody, earthy and lightly boozy, and featuring a nice little black currant fruitiness just for good measure. 

The flavor is very roasty and on the drier side of the style. The bitterness is prevalent throughout and is very enjoyable. Some more of that currant shows up in the flavor and it works nicely with the general earthy character and hop flavor of the beer. I really liked the flavor of this beer and I would have scored it even higher but there was this light tinge of medicinal character in the finish that was mildly annoying and off putting, but beyond that this was a very nice beer and not what I expected from a Mikkeller Imperial Porter.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

From the pour, which started quite flat, this deeply tan coffee coloured head bubbled into life and its retaining well, as I get about a third of the way down my pint glass. This is a stunning beer. All the heavy roast malt characteristics you could want in a porter, but then a faintly spicy , but noticeable, hop note creeps in to give a great balance. On the tongue its smooth, rich and so fully flavoured. Theres liquid chocolate in the finish and the aftertaste is a myriad of dark complex flavours. Mouthfeel is absolutely fasntastic and it is well coated. One of the finest Ive tasted and, yet again,Aa beer that really belies its ABV. Almost unnoticeable.","Carlisle, Cumbria, ENGLAND","RichardW"
158,"2011-09-18",3.8,"Bottle that I picked up at Beers of Europe, consumed at my mums, Worcester, 16.09.11   Pours black with a beige head. Has that typical Mikkeller flavour running through it, dificult to describe that exactly but I sort of know it when I taste it. Lovely porter though it has to be said that this is more smoother, indulgent and refined that a typical porter that I would be used to in the UK. Some smooth cappucinno coffee, and coffee ice cream on the nose. Like I suggest this is maybe not exactly the best example of the style but its a damn fine beer nonetheless.
