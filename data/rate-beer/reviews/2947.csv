2947,"2016-04-18",2.8,"Bottle from Ciderwinkel, large sample. Clear orange color, short frothy head. Aroma of sweet apple, bit skunky, some apple pie. Taste of sweet mashed apples, slight spicy apple pie note to it, but mostly just apples. Boring and not complex enough if you ask me. Least of the bunch in a small cider tasting this evening.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"

2947,"2015-10-09",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of John Nolan at Johnny Off L. in Rome-Italy. Thank you. Pours a amber-golden color, clear and shining in the glass. Some bubbling on the surface. Nose is a little vinous, cellar notes, apples skin. Mouth is not a blast of sweetness, more balanced. Green apple, complex cider. Impossible not to drink it all. A real gem!

2947,"2015-07-12",3.9,"Solid, clear golden with a tight bubbly head. Nose is oily, sulphury washed red chopped apple. Thick set mouthfeel, but a fairly spriteful carbonation. Finishes lean, solid display of the ABV whilst being a simple enough sweep of quenching apple. Bottle, Cheers Steve, Beers I Hadnt Known Tasting","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","McNeillR"

2947,"2014-10-24",4.1,"750 no bottle from Drinkstore. Hazy pale gold, thin white head around the edges of the glass. Nose is green apple skins, a little sour/tartness and a touch of bready yeast. Pretty complex in flavour, fizzy and tart first, some juicy sweetness in the middle, then dries out toward the finish. Liquid coats the mouth and the acidity lingers on the breath. Really finely balanced between dry and sweet. Decent body for a cider, carbonation right up at champagne levels. Really drinkable, gorgeous stuff.","Dublin, IRELAND","ciaranc"
