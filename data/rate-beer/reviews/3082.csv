3082,"2017-02-04",4.3,"750 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger desne khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, nuttiness, caramel, toffee, molasses, and toasted dark bread; with lighter notes of raisin, plum, cherry, date, tobacco, leather, herbal, pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, nuttiness, caramel, toffee, molasses, and toasted dark bread; with lighter notes of raisin, plum, cherry, date, tobacco, leather, herbal, pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy hop and roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, nuttiness, caramel, toffee, molasses, toasted dark bread, light dark fruit/herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from hop/roast bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 9%. Overall this is a fantastic smoked Baltic porter! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the ABV. A perfectly executed style representation with the addition of cherrywood smoked malts. A really amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3082,"2016-07-18",2.9,"Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is black (non-opaque, flashlight tested).

Well, they dont seem to have used much smoked malt, because theres not much of it in the nose. If youre looking for something Schlenkerla-level, youll be badly disappointed (its even less smoky than Alaskan Smoked Porter). But I guess a lot of American breweries fear *really* making beer smoky for fear of scaring away customers...I certainly remember my first experience with Schlenkerla being off-putting, even though I eventually came to like it quite a bit. Its basically just a boozy chocolatey beer with a little bit of burnt grain/wood character. Not bad per se, but certainly disappointing and rather dull.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3082,"2016-07-05",4.6,"""Well it was Gatlinburg in mid-July / And I just hit town and my throat was dry / I thought Id stop and have myself a brew / At an old saloon on a street of mud / There at a table, dealing stud / Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue"" - Johnny Cash, ""A Boy Named Sue."" Life may not be easy for a beer named Sue, but it sure drinks easy. Sue is more of a malt bomb than a smoky beer. The smoke is only a savory whisper in the roasty aroma. Its only an element in the flavor profile. It adds just a touch of woody meatiness to the toasted malt, coffee, and chocolate notes. Did I say woody meatiness? That sounds weird. Ah well. Full-bodied and warm yet very mellow. If only Id gotten to taste this beer with the brisket I enjoyed hours earlier. Still, Sue is perfectly fine all by itself.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Higher gravity and toasted malt flavor add creaminess which is especially evident in the vigorous head. There is some modest complexity and a fairly long clean finish.","","Lupulucid"
3082,"2013-11-17",4.0,"Bottled May 2012

Its dark brown on black with a hourglass shaped tan silkscreen. Smells of smoke, prunes, cocoa, hersheys syrup, a little dates as well as vanilla. Flavor is smoke, leather, sweet dark malts, some dried dates and a touch of prune juice. Full bodied with a silky feel and a dry finish. Good beer, really good beer.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"
3082,"2013-11-08",4.1,"Poured into a snifter out of a 750ml bottle.

Pours pitch black with a velvety one finger tan head. Pretty good head retention with some nice wispy lacing

A really nice mix of roast, chocolate, and smoke on the nose. There is almost a burnt character to the nose but it is not overdone. A really nice balance there and just very rich all around.

Big shot of smoke up front in the taste along with lots of roast and velvety chocolate. I really like the cherry wood and the smokyness is very gentle and not burnt and medicinal as is sometimes the case with smoked porters. Big, chewy mouthfeel with moderate stickyness. Definitely a sipper.

Overall, I really like this beer. I am a bit fan of smoked beers anyways and this one just does it right with a great balance between the smoke and roast. Even thought this is brewed in my home state, I cant get it where I live. A shame because I would buy this on a regular basis.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

A - Pours a pitch black body that lets almost zero light through. Massive mocha head that sticks around for a long time. Gobs of sticky lacing and lasting retention. Pretty beer for sure.

S - Well. Smoke. Smoke and lots of it. It isnt artificial or over the top, it oddly has layers. Starts off a bit sweet and salty and finishes with a bit of cinnamon spice. Maybe a touch of coffee and chocolate, but those are very secondary. Long lasting char burn.

T - Opens up with soft smoke. Quickly washed away by bitter coffee beans and some milk chocolate. The finish returns to that smoky wood that works nicely against the mineral quality of the porter base. Finishes clean without giving the impression of chewing on a piece of charcoal. 

M - Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Pretty spot on for a porter.

O - Well Im a changed man. From drain pour to somewhat impressed, this is a very solid smoked porter. The aroma is big and smokey but the flavor itself is clean, light, and the smoke never overwhelms. I figured a beer like this in a large format is a terrible idea. Nope, it totally works.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Utterly black in color with a very fine, subsiding head.

The nose is nicely smoked, not overwhelming, with some caramel, molasses, tons of chocolate, ranging from milk to dark, with some light bitterness.  The flavor is lightly sweet molasses, caramel, and milk chocolate up front, moving to the more roasted dark and smokey notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and toasted cocoa nibs.

3082,"2012-01-21",4.1,"A beer named Sue!  This has a medium-brown colored, bubbly head thats airy and fizzes out fast atop an extremely dark brown-colored body, almost black, with some transparency thats hard to see unless you look at the edges - otherwise a pretty solid and dark color.  The bartender said this was her favorite, but you have to like smoked beers.  Lucky for me.  The aroma is a good tell sign of a good smoked beer in my opinion.  This one has an almost barbeque/jerky/smoked meat aroma.  Very delectable and good.  Definitely the best Ive had so far from Yazoo.  Not very often can you have all of the beers from an obscure brewery from half a country away.  Flavor is not as inviting as the aroma, though.  Its a little tame for the heft of the aroma.  Although it still showcases what this beer is made of.  Its very dense and very smoky in the mouth.  The dense smokiness and slight roasted bitterness carries through to the finish very well, and in a very bitter way.  For a smoked beer its very good (esp for an American smoked).  Almost up to par with an authentic Rauchbier, but on the lighter end.  A little sweetness carries through to the finish as well due to whats left behind on your tongue and lips after the smoke and roast decimates your mouth.  Im very impressed!","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

First, a HUGE thank you to my southern brother, bluesandbarbq, for sending me this wonderful brew. Yazoo was all over this one when they made it, and the proof is in the beer. The beer pour out a mahogany brown/blackish body with a beige 1/2"" cap. Aroma is smoke, tar, a litte leather, rosted malts and charred fruit. Flavor steers more towards the roasted malts, than smokey malts, and its almost stout-like with the flavor. Woody, roasty, smokey, lightly figgy, light bitterness with bit of a twangy/alcoholic finish. Definitely blurs the lines in my mind between a smoked ale/porter/stout.

I would be content to just draw off the snifter and never bother to actually drink the beer.

Pours a deep, dark chestnut brown color that appears pitch black and completely opaque in the glass with a one finger frothy light beige head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind.

Smokey, roasted malt aroma with hints of burnt toast, charcoal, BBQ, bacon and burnt wood. Underneath the smoked malt there are hints of chocolate, caramel, oatmeal and nut as well as some earthy hops. Smells nice ans smokey without being one dimensional with the chocolate notes really standing out.

Medium boded, on the fuller end with a nice toasted/smokey character that lingers throughout over the bitter dark malt notes and earthy hops into a slightly sweet, yet dry, finish. Roasty and smokey up front with hints of charcoal and hickory smoked BBQ which lingers long into the aftertaste. Slightly burnt tasting but the sweet notes and hop bitterness prevent it from becoming acrid and one dimensional. Underneath the smoke there is a nice bittersweet dark chocolate malt character along with hints of toffee, oatmeal and coffee bean. The hops compliment the dark chocolate malt, adding a nice dry, earthy bitterness toward the end of the palate. Very smokey but still complex and flavorful.

All I can say about this beer is wow. A hidden gem it was (relatively) cheap, from a brewery that I didnt know could do such things, and a state not exactly known for shaking up styles. Anybody who is a fan of smoked beers should put this on the top of their list. Easily accessible it should not be hard to track down.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep inky black body was much more moody than anticipated - almost like a teenage black hole pouting over not being able to go out to a party. The head was the color of dusty old newspaper which hadnt been archived properly and is beginning to crumble from age. The nose is where it really gets your focus. Chocolate malt balls eaten while watching friends bowl in a haze of smoke is touched by black coffee, licorice, and bacon bits. The smoke is strong but does not overwhelm as it could otherwise do.

Flavor / Palate - Melted black licorice chews seize the throat and are chased by ash filled coffee rinds. The bitterness and full body are spot on making you want to reach for the glass until pretty soon there is nothing left. The alcohol isnt exactly subtle but at the same time it does not overpower the flavors underneath. A cheap affordable introduction to the American way of doing smoked beers I relish the next chance I get to try this gem.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3082,"2011-02-09",3.3,"In short: A highly roasted (read burnt) and dry black beer with a touch of smoke.  Ok
How: Bottle 12oz.  Exact age unknown, but supposedly relatively fresh.  Split two-way
The look: Black body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose has moderate roast (burnt wood), a tiny bit of smoke and a very light cardboard oxidation.  Taste is burnt malts, burnt black cake, ashes, light chocolaty notes, a bit chalky, peat, charcoal, mild notes of smoke.  Some earthy hops. Nothing fruity or refreshing here, everything is burnt and bone dry.  I was surprised to learn this is a Smoke.  The smoke notes were rather mild and I have had many roasted stouts that had as much of a smoky character as this beer.  All in all, it was an ok beer for what it was but I was hoping for more.  Maybe the bottle wasnt all that fresh.  I believe this is the first beer I have from the home of country music Nashville Tennessee.

3082,"2011-01-17",3.3,"12 oz bottle thrown in as an extra by TheEpeeist. Chris, always surprising me. Pours a fairly dark brownish pour, some ruby copper edges and bottom. Not opaque, a frothy tannish moderate sized head sits atop, dies to an ok film, light lacing. Aromas are chocolate, roast, barley, touches of biscuits and bread. Light smokiness, touches of light infection notes. Brett, roasty, toffee, and light smokiness with cocoa and caramel coming up behind. Initial is thinner bodied, touches of roast, cocoa, light malty biscuits. Light cherry acidity, sourness just lightly but it does grow into a sour cherry domination with cherrywood smoked malt, lightly earthy, lingering acidity. Roasty malts are cut out, sweet malts and sour cherries remain. Maybe a retry down the road. The sour isnt distracting, and it certainly remains drinkable, but I was just a little dissappointed in expecting a great smoked beer and getting sour cherry bliss.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3082,"2010-12-21",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2011 Rating #2,000. 12 oz bottle sent to me by my 2010 Winter Secret Santa.  Bottled on MAR Week 3 according to notches on the label.  Pour is black with a nice khaki one inch head that is quite lasting.  Some nice carbonation bubbles stream up the slide of the glass.  The aroma is fire ember smoky, along with a soft roastiness.  The smoke and roast play together nicely to form a very soft smoke - subtle, but also present.  Really clean.  The taste follows the nose, integrated roast and dying fire smokiness, along with a bit of sweetness near the finish.  The alcohol is also present in the dry chalky finish.  The taste is not quite as clean as the nose, though it is really nicely balanced between the smoke and Porter elements.  The palate is medium bodied, with gentle fine carbonation.  The aforementioned sweetness through the finish detracts a bit, but still a really nicely constructed beer.  Thanks for sending this one my way Phil!

A quick note about why I chose this beer for #2,000.  This beer represents much of what I have learned and enjoyed at ratebeer. This is a style of beer (smoked) I knew pretty much nothing about brewed by a brewer (Yazoo) I had never heard of obtained through a means (trading / Secret Santa - thanks Phil!) I would have never dreamt of.  I even drank it out of a glass I would never have seen without this site (Duvel mini tulip, thanks Eugene!).  In short, this is a tribute to all the great knowledge I have acquired on this site, as well as the great people I have met.  This ones for my Kansas City crew, the great ratebeer folk down in Houston, and all my great ratebeer friends out in Seattle.  Further, big thanks to the folks I have traded with and the admins that work tirelessly keeping this site great.  Finally, thanks to Joe for making this site what it is.  Like all the great spots in the world, its not perfect - but its got character and I have a lot of fun hanging out here.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

The taste begins with dark roasted malts, smooth smokiness and sweet molasses. It then turns only a touch ashy mixed with Alderwood smoked salmon before the finish unleashes chocolate and caramel into the fray.

Nose is sweet chocolate, caramel, smoke and berries. Medium body is sweet and nearly sticky, but swept off the tongue nicely by the charry roast and smoke on the finish. Nearly becomes frothy with a bit much carbonation at times. Front is chocolate berry, turning to charred wood, then to the darkest espresso/mocha, with some cream and a hint of piquant green herb. Near the end of the bottle, it all blends into a nice mocha/almond espresso and charred, salty driftwood flavor.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
3082,"2010-10-24",3.6,"12 oz. bottle, marked as bottled in August (Im assuming 2010), so its just a couple months old.  The body is pitch black at first glance, showing some mahogany translucency when strongly backlit.  A small head of bubbly beige froth settles quickly to a thin but lasting blanket, leaving full, hard swaths and broken cobwebs of lacing on the glass.  Aromas are sweet, smoky, and fruity, suggesting notes of chocolate covered cherries and truffles with smoked, salted almonds.  Theres definitely some burnt caramel in there, along with traces of lactose.  Flavors follow suit, very caramel-centric and heavy on dried cocoa. The cherrywood lends a uniquely sweet and fruity smoke component that is completely different than what Im used to with smoked brews.  Theres a bit of roast and some coffee, bringing a semblance of balance, though it remains largely a sweet porter. Again, there is a lightly salty nuttiness that comes through on the finish and lingers, along with some dried fruits.  The palate is a little thinner than Id care for, and the carbonation is a little overly active and scratchy, but it is passable.  Overall, its a unique and tasty brew, but Id prefer a little less sweetness and some more body.  Good brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3082,"2010-10-03",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2011 Re-review.  Turns out the first bottles of this I had was from an infected batch.  I had it before the infection really took off but it would explain the lactic quality I was picking up.
12oz bottled 2nd week of November 2010.  Served at cellar temperature.  Pours dark brown/black with a large light brown head that leaves lots of lacing, slowly recedes to a wispy cap and ring.  Aroma is quite smoky with a lot of campfire and charred wood as well as smoked ham/bacon, also some chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, a touch of dark fruit and anise, very good strength.  Flavor is smoky and chocolaty, smoked ham and bacon, campfire, charred wood, chocolate, some coffee, roasted malts, dark fruit, noticeable alcohol on the finish but is integrated well (diminishes quickly with age as this 3 month old bottle has little to no alcohol).  Huge flavor, lingering finish, semi-sweet.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation at times prickly.  Ahhh very nice, no lactic qualities like the first go-round.  Also enjoyed a Fade to Black Vol. 2 tonight and like them both a lot.  Each is unique in their smoky qualities, this one more as a straight-up smoked brew.  Very tasty and enjoyable.  

12oz bottled 3rd or 4th week of August 2010.  Served at around 55-60F.  Pours very dark brown/black with a fizzy and foamy two finger light brown head that fades quickly to a light cap and ring and leaves only a few spots of lacing.  I notice some white specks of sediment collecting at the bottom of the glass.  Smoky aroma of both wood and meat, bacon/ham, a lot of chocolate, and a strong lactic quality, a lot like cottage cheese, which I wasnt expecting at all, but it blends nicely with the smoke and I find myself quite enjoying the aroma.  Flavor of smoked ham and bacon, some chocolate and roasted malts, a lactic sourness, a good deal of sweetness and a touch of hop bitterness on the finish.  Alcohol is absent.  Smoke is stronger on the tongue than the nose.  Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, somewhat creamy, medium carbonation.  Interesting for sure, Im only beginning to dabble in smoked beers and this is the smokiest Ive had yet, although Im not a big fan of the lactic nature of this one (or any sweet/milk stouts in general).  Im getting more of a Smoked Sweet/Milk Stout than Smoked Porter, FWIW...

3082,"2010-04-07",4.1,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with illinismitty, one of Nashvilles finest- thanks again, Sean!  Pours a super dark opaque brown, almost black except for some brown highlights when held up to light, with a tiny tan head that turns into a tiny ring on the inner edge of the glass.  Aroma gets better as it warms: notes of smoked wood, smoked meats, roasted malts, earth, coffee, and dark chocolate.  The flavor is just as nice and smoky, with the same wood and meat notes, roasted chocolate malts, coffee, earthy notes, and some tart, dark fruits.  The smoke is mild and balanced well with the beer, a great amount and a standard for other smoked beers.   Medium-full bodied, with average carbonation and a rich, roasty mouthfeel and smoky finish.  I sure hope there is more of this when I head down to Nashville this weekend; this is an awesome beer and an outstanding example of the style.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

A: Pours a very deep shade of dark black. A nice tan khaki head quickly rises and then dies to a nice solid ring. Beautiful sheet lacing is left all the way down the glass.

S: Wonderful aromas that only got better as it warmed. I started this one at 55 degrees and by the time it got to room temp it was a wonderful smelling brew. Tons of smoked malt for sure. Earthy chocolate, light coffee, earth, and hints of grassy hops.

T: Wonderful Wonderful smoked beer. This one is so much more than just smoke. The smoke is bold without being over the top. Nothing acrid about it at all. Is says they used Cherry wood which is a good choice. As a BBQer myself I think the milder smoke from the cherry wood really complimented the base porter. Bakers chocolate and hints of earthy hops are there. Threshold levels of dark fruit can be picked up as well.

M: On the fuller side of medium, smooth for a smoked beer, a bit of bite in the finish.

D: Really good for the style. Glad I got more than one. Next weekend I think I will fire up the smoker, cook some ribes over cherry wood and pair it up with a couple of these bad boy.

I purchased land in Tennessee several years ago. It makes me happy to know that I will have access to these guys when I move there. This is a tasty beer, and I have learned that the only thing better than a boy named Sue, is a beer named Sue!","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"

The flavor is interesting; a rich woody smoke, but not anywhere near dominating or meaty, cherry flavors are everywhere, how cherry wood could impart this I have no idea.

3082,"2010-01-07",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2016 12 oz. bottle from Midtown. I have had three bottles of Sue now. I was incredibly blown away every time. See, my beef with smoked beers is they are never smoky and full bodied enough. The Schlenkerla line could probably not be any smokier, but their palate and malt flavor is nothing remarkable. The Smokejumper has a huge flavor and palate, but the smokiness is not nearly massive. Alaskan Smoked Porter, the benchmark for smoked ales, cuts the difference with a smooth and flavorful offering. What a little brewery in good old Tennessee has somehow managed to do is answer my smoked beer prayers. Sue is monstrously smoky and very full bodied. This style really loans itself to sitting out on a cold winter night and pairing with a cigar. Sue actually has the testicles to do such a thing. So much smoke in the aroma. Its a complex and fruity smoke. Ive used cherry wood a few times for barbeque and weve got a textbook example of its goodness reflected in this beer. Very subtle sweet hints highlight the sturdy earthy malts while piles of meat tantalize my nose. The mouthfeel is firm and slick. The smoke is anything but subtle in the flavor. This could be one of the smokiest beers Ive had. Somehow the bacon fat flavor I love in the style is reflected here even with the use of cherry wood rather than beech. A bittersweet fruit presence blends with a bold malt foundation of dark chocolate and coffee. I am just completely blown away right now. Not only is this arguably the best smoked beer Ive ever had, its also the cheapest of any reasonable quality: $6.99/ 4 pack. This is a true divine experience.

Bottle. This is a grossly underrated beer. What else could you want from a smoked beer? seriously. What does someone need to do to make a smoked beer better than this? The pour is attractive with its near black body and small tan head. The aroma. . .ah, that delightful smoky bouquet of meat, campfire, cherry, coffee. This just screams barbeque. The mouthfeel is dense and is an excellent vessel for all the smoky goodness to tantalize my palate. Up front I find ashy, pure smoke flavors, then some coffee and chocolate flavors I relate to a solid porter. The finish lingers with chewy smoked meats and bacon fat with a residual cherry quality that is basically identical to the flavor I get from my own barbequeing forays involving cherry wood. Absolutely stellar ale from Yazoo and its sad it goes so under-appreciated.

Bottle. What an underrated brew. This beer is seriously delicious. It is holding up impeccably nearly three months later. Very heavy smoke is still delightfully potent in the aroma with solid meat, campfire and those subtle fruity tones with a chocolate twist. Mouthfeel is smooth and the flavor is meaty, smoky, and fruity. Lots and lots of delicious smoked character is in this robust ale. Start to finish this is about the smoke and meat flavor with a round and complex finish with hints at earth, chocolate and fruit. More breweries should attempt to make ales as richly smoky as this. What an underappreciated beer.

Bought a bunch more SUE of the 3rd week of August, 2010 batch. I am so happy to once again have this in my grasp. Ive had a couple bottles in the weeks since my purchase and Im currently sipping a room temperature serving. Yeah, yeah I didnt have any in the fridge and I really wanted one. It doesnt strike me to be as smoky as I recall, though it is still strong in that department. That could be attributed to the higher than optimal serving temperature. I get a lot more malt flavor now with tons of dark chocolate and coffee notes. The finish is ashy and has a delightful meaty quality. I will rerate some of this batch in the future when its closer to cellar temp.

So Sue has shown up in Denver now. Im not upset about that. Picked up a bomber at Mile High. Its as good as I remember, but still not quite what it was the first year it came out and I bought more than a case. They are expectedly maintaining this more balanced, less intense porter. Its black with a khaki head. Good smoked meat aromas. Sound cacao and espresso in the flavor with campfire. Ample hoppy balance too. Not as smoky as the Sue of old, but still very enjoyable.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

I like my smoked beers to be , you know, smokey, and this certainly fits the bill.

3082,"2009-12-31",4.1,"Updated Rating based on first bottled version I guess Linus has changed the recipe since the inaugural batch. Now this beer has more body and more intensity. The body is just right, not too thin or too thick. I really like smoked cherry malt, as its very complex by adding smoke AND wood notes (cedar) to the  dark roasted malts. I think its save to say that this is in the same league with some of my favorite smoked beers. I think Yazoo has nailed this, and can now focus on making me a West Coast style Double IPA (or a barleywine). I have the perfect name for it- ""Smitty"". They can take the same label, make it blue, and change the font. Linus- that is your assignment because I know you are reading this. 
First Ratingdraft at MCBF. Pours dark brown with a tan head. Nice aroma of dark hardwood mulch, cherry, and ale esters. Lighter side of medium bodied with average carbonation. Flavor of black patent malts, peat, liquid smoke, and dark berries. Slight acidity on the finish, with notes of green apple and ash. Alcohol well hidden. Overall, not too shabby. Not too heavy on the smoke traits and the cherry wood has some interesting complexities. However, I personally  thought it could use more body, as it had a perceived thinness in the middle. I compare all smoked porters to Stone or Alaskan Brewing, and this is not quite as good or well-rounded as those. 8-4-7-3-14","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
3082,"2009-12-28",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2010 Sue is an exceptionally balanced smoked porter that any beer lover should experience. It pours a deep, dark brown with a lacing tan foam. Aromas are of smoke, roasted grains, malts, barley, and chocolate with just enough hops for balance. The rich flavors burst of cherry, cedar, roasted malt, and more smoke. Yazoo has been tinkering with this recipe for some time now. With their first bottling, they seem to have really hit the nail on the head.

2nd bottle. OK I just rated this and had another bottle. Sad to say that there seems to be a lot of bottle variation with this beer. 2nd bottle from another case was not nearly the stand out that the first was. Oops. Thought Yazoo had figured things out. May be not....

Glass:Snifter. 
Appearance:Dark brown pour with a thick brown head.  
Aroma:Roasted malt, meat, smoke and some cherry earthiness. 
Flavor:Heavy roasted malt flavors, with a pronounced cherry smokiness. 
Palate:Much fuller body than the original recipe, but not so much body that it graduates into the Imperial Stout category.  Slightly lower carbonation than the original.
Overall:In the great context of things, this was pretty disappointing.  It is great that we finally can get high alc Yazoo brews, but this needed more body.  The first part was my original comments.  I wanted to praise Linus and the gang for addressing the seemingly consistent opinon of the original beer, making the changes and churning out the BEST beer that has come from Yazoo.
