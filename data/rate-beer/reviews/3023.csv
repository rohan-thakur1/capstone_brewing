3023,"2017-02-10",4.2,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2016 vintage bottled in 5/2016. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy medium ruby red/light copper color with a 1 finger foamy off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing eventually. Light spotty lacing on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining a thin cap. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, toasted oak, spicy rye whiskey, coconut, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, apricot, and apple; with light notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, almond, molasses, butterscotch, and yeast/oak earthiness. A fair amount of booze in the aromas as it warms. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, rye whiskey barrel, and moderate fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, toasted oak, spicy rye whiskey, coconut, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, apricot, and apple; with light notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, almond, molasses, butterscotch, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate rye whickey/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, toasted oak, spicy rye whiskey, coconut, brown bread, dark fruit, apricot, apple, light cocoa/fudge, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, rye whiskey barrel, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt and rye whiskey/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from rye whiskey/oak spiciness, increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, fairly tannic, and lightly slick/syrupy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is fairly well hidden; pleasantly warming, and not too boozy. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged English barleywine! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, rye whiskey barrel, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Huge on the rye barrel presence, but still has impressive balance; and is not too tannic, drying, or boozy. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3023,"2017-02-07",4.3,"Really nice barrel character here. I thought it might be lacking as its a single barrel, but damn what a barrel it is. Sweet vanilla chocolate and toffee, light spice and oak. Cant tell its 15% though its a sipper.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3023,"2016-12-29",4.3,"Bottle, split with jamesy. Huge, sweet, malt bomb with a lot of character and complexity. Its smoother than I remember Double DBA being, with a caramel sweetness that blends into an oak sweetness from the barrel. I got a strong vanilla flavor too, which was a great addition to the other sweet flavors. Really pleased to get a chance to try this one, and it lived up to the hype.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3023,"2016-11-19",4.2,"Amber color with a white head. Subdued dank malt-hop aroma. Dull sweet malt bomb with a bit of a bite; quite well balanced.

Aroma: just wow! Coconut butterscotch vanilla toasted oak

Taste: Oozing with burnt caramel maltiness. Has those trademark Firestone Walker butterscotch barrel aged notes 

Overall: This has Sticker Monkee all over it. Not a huge amount of difference between this and DDBA","California, USA","doublebock"
3023,"2016-10-02",4.1,"22, capped and foiled. Thanks, J! Another insane treat to savor. Pours a murky, near-opaque dark brown with a dense and creamy but thin tan film of head. No lacing to speak of. Big sweet nose, insane combination of intense caramel, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, piercing alcohols kept just under control, and some peppery grain husk notes in the background. Creamy thick heavy body. Caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, heat, and a bit of pepper on the mid palate. Syrupy but still quite drinkable. Lovely beer for sure.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Taste is more of the rye barrel wow this is so smooth toffee caramel sweetness spice vanilla barrel.
