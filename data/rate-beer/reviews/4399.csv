Sweet start with sweet roasted malt and cocoa. Flavors thin out in the finish and linger, making it seem a bit watery.

4399,"2015-03-23",3.9,"I have to give this a little lower rating if it is being rated as a Schwartz bier. I feel it is closer to a rauchbier/smoke beer. Smokey aroma. Black in color.

This beer has gotten better.  It now tastes like a Bamberger Rauchbier as it should.  It should not be categorized as a Schwerzbier, but as a Rauchbier.

4399,"2013-12-11",3.3,"I think this beer is misclassified; it should be a smoked beer. To me theres nothing ""subtle"" about the smokiness. Poured at a good temperature with a modest light tan head that soon settled to a large island, ring, and some lace. Color is a clear mahogany with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is smoke dominated and then malt and a bit of spice. Flavors like nose plus has some tart. Fairly dry. Body is slightly thin, carbonation ok. Finish is like flavor, some change to medicinal, gradual taper, not really for me. Wish it had been a traditional schwarzbier.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"

Its near black with some nut brown hues below a fine creamy toasted sheet. Smells nice and roasty with soil, char, toast, some prunes and cocoa. Flavor follows suit with some nice roasted malts, dry soil, some hints of cocoa and leather - a really nice beer. Nice light body with a crispy carbonation and a wet finish (surprisingly). I like this beer quite a bit.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"
4399,"2013-09-08",2.9,"Bottled. Poured deep brown with a short, toasted beige head. The aroma picked up very sweet vanilla, molasses, and nutty notes with light earthy accents.. lots of sugars and roast, but it didnt really come together. The flavor found similar stuff.. sweet and roasty vanilla, black malts, and molasses throughout.. dry, roasty finish. Light-bodied with moderate-plus carbonation.. not great, but very drinkable.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4399,"2013-08-31",3.8,"Single bottle from HyVee. Foamy pour, which reveals a solid black stoutish body. Smell is full of roastiness and some smokey peat. Taste brings in a lot more smokiness. In fact, this really should go down as a smoked beer instead of a schwarz.And I think its just fine. Some stout roast, a bit of stout sourness, matched by some not-so-subtle smoke. Maybe more from peat that than rauchmalt, but quite enjoyable.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

4399,"2013-06-05",2.5,"12oz bottle.  Unfiltered brown-black body.  Standard beige head.  Unpleasant dry cocoa aroma, very cheap and oily.  There is only so far you can go with cheap malt, and Schell proves this time and again.  Clearly brewed with a little intention and knowledge, but the cheap, chalky malt tones really bring it down.  Not to say it isnt true to style; this is certainly the caliber of beer you would expect to find in Eastern Europe for 43cents.  Definitely not good, only for the tickers.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

4399,"2013-02-10",2.6,"A refreshing run of the mill schwarzbier; a style I dont visit very often. Aroma was roasted malt and that typical lager aroma. Pour was a nice dark brown with red hues and a one finger off white head. Taste was very spritzy. Strong carbonation bites the mouth with roasted malt and lager taste are left after the swallow. A little one dimensional, but a decent beer. Could benefit from a little stronger flavor.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"

Pours a reddish dark brown colored brew with a decent sized off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing and a rocky foam top. Aroma of roasted dark malts, some hard dark fruits, a touch of smoked beef jerky and mild chocolate malt. Taste is medium bodied, soft carbonation with flavors of smoked beef jerky, toasted dark malt, a hint of dark chocolate and some grassy hops. Finish continues the smoked dark malt aftertaste with a mild bitterness that slowly disappears. More of a rauchbier than a schwarzbier.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
4399,"2013-01-18",3.9,"12 oz Bottle.  Aroma: Malt sweetness, slightly bready with a hint of nutmeg / spice.  Appearance:  pours black.  Nice head that lingers, good lacing.  Taste:  malty, hops are more subtle than you may expect from the description, faint note anise. Palate: well rounded, malt adds a bit of syrupy feel, not a bad note just a bit heavier / thicker than youd expect from a lager. Overall:  Solid effort.  An enjoyable beer.","Iowa, USA","megawill"

4399,"2013-01-05",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2013 Dark brown with a crimson tinge and good head retention and great lacing. Has a barley, malty, grassy, and slight smokey ham scent. In the flavor the smoked ham scent is much stronger and sweeter, along with malty and hoppy flavors. Body is moderate and the carbonation has a slight bite to it.

Toffee and tobacco notes are strong up front with some nice prunes behind it. This tastes like a sweet toff mixed with hints of cocoa. There is also some hint of minerals in the long finish. The nose was promising, but this is just a little to light for a schwarz in my eyes. Still, a nice effort.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

4399,"2012-12-12",3.8,"Pours a dark reddish brown almost a Mahogany color The head is big and fluffy and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is rich, malty and roasty with some nice coffee tones, some light metallic character and mild smoke. 

The flavor is clean and lightly roasty. The smoke character isnt dominant but it brings a heartiness to the beer that is very delicious. The hoppiness is very herbal and lightly fruity, all around its a very old-worldy hop character, and that is no knock on it at all, a beer like this deserves hopping of this nature. The beer is rich with a mild malt sweetness and some light bitter chocolate character. 

The mouthfeel is big and a little velvety, but the beer is very easy to drink. 

So who entered this as an ""American Dark Lager?"" The commercial description tells us ""Schells Chimney Sweep is inspired by the rich dark lagers of upper Franconia."" which immediately points this more in the direction of Schwartzbier... but its weird because the smokiness and the richness of the malt make me think Baltic Porter, its sure not strong enough to be a Baltic Porter though.... Its a hybrid beer no doubt... but American Dark Lager seems a weird place to put it. Its pretty good... whatever it is.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

4399,"2012-12-10",3.5,"Pours dark brown with a 2 finger, creamy tan head. Aroma is pretty smoky, seems like a blend with possibly a little peat in there, toast and nutty notes. Flavor is smoke, light char, roast, slightly burnt toasted bread, light earthy hops and nice minerality to the finish. Light to medium body, creamy, slightly chalky feel and light carbonation. Really tasty stuff, hard to beat a good smoked beer for a good price. Seems like it would fit better in the Schwarzbier or Smoked category though.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
