2632,"2016-09-30",3.0,"Bottle: &nbsp Bright orange, sediment abounds, thin white frothy head, little lacing, soft carbonation. &nbsp Soft wheaty nose, a little bready with a hint of dried straw and hay. &nbsp Similar tongue, very slight tartness. &nbsp Guessing this should be a Kristalweizen as its advertised as a ""Clear Wheat Ale"", however its got some sediment in there. &nbsp Moderate body and mouthfeel. &nbsp Meh, a touch of a fruity wheaty finish, but its mild, bready, and not terribly wheaty. &nbsp Tiz okay, but not one of my favs from Sound.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

2632,"2015-08-21",3.3,"So light and refreshing...almost too light. Pours a bright, clear golden copper with a thick pure white head. The nose is banana bread, light cloves, a bit of bubblegum and crisp wheat malts. Nice and easy going. Not overly complex but nicely done with banana and clove notes. Crisp, clean, mild bitterness and uber refreshing. A hint of apricot is apparent after enjoying more.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"
2632,"2015-06-07",2.8,"On tap at VCBW Festival, pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Nose brings out lots of Belgian yeast, banana and bubblegum. Flavour is along the same lines, with banana, bubblegum and Belgian yeast. Something seems off here. The banana notes seem like unintended off-notes. Okay.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Aroma is lemon and cereal grains with hints of banana and spices. Taste is a lemony sourness with a grassy hop bitterness and grainy malty sweetness finishing with some banana and spices. This ale is pretty good except for the lemon sourness that threw me off a bit.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"

2632,"2012-07-30",3.1,"Orange-sunrise-tang with an adequate head. Soft wheat nose, and what seems like coriander. This one definitely has a bit something more than the typical American Wheat--seems more Belgian style to me. The body is modest wheat, some traces of coriander, Belgian candi, and a touch of wet shoe and burnt sugar. Earlier Rating: 8/28/2011 Total Score: 2.9Light, pale, cloudy bronze with some head, but noticeable carbonation. Restrained German phenols, quite pleasant. Some banana and wheat for a smooth, spritely body. Corn notes arise after some aeration. Twangy wheat flavor with some corn mixed in. The flavor falls off a bit.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
