949,"2012-08-14",3.8,"This reddish orange hued beer has a big Chardonnay aroma that really comes through on the flavor. Buttery but still sharp. A little bit spicy. The common beer is underneath playing a minor role.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"

949,"2012-08-07",3.6,"Very lightly hazy yellow pour.  Aroma is a hint of beer mixed with a nice tropical fruit/oaked chardonnay.  The flavor really leans more towards a chardonnay than a beer.  Some tropical fruit, minerality, and a hint of buttescotch and marshmallow.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
949,"2012-07-31",3.5,"Bottle shared at Blue Palms during RBSG 2012. Smooth buttery oak and chardonnay in the nose and flavor. Not really much of a base beer to be detected -- this is all about the barrel aging. Maybe a bit of malty body underneath the sweet vinous notes. Tastes fine but Id like more of a marriage between the beer and wine.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
949,"2012-07-26",3.6,"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a white head.  Nose is somewhat tropical.  A nice pineapple note, which for some reason, goes well with the Chardonnay character.  A bit of oak, straw, and malt sweetness, too.  The flavor is sweet, but has almost a light tartness.  Very nice wine flavor, a bit of tropical fruit, honey, and yeast.  Wasnt expecting much of anything from a wine barrel steam beer, but this was nice.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
949,"2012-07-23",2.8,"Bottle. Hazy light orange liquid with small to medium off-white head. Aroma of white wine, cereal, oak, sweet light fruit and some biscuit. Taste is dry, light bitter and light to medium sour with notes of wine and weird fruit. Medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Just too weird, didnt really enjoy it.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"
949,"2012-07-23",3.2,"Bottle at RBSG 2012. Cloudy blonde color with thick lace. Nose of lemon, butter, vanilla, pilsner malt. Big vanilla and oak flavor with butter, honey, malts. Lightly sour. Too much really, with the oaked chardonnay taking over, and feels a lot like diacetyl. interesting, though.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
949,"2012-07-22",4.1,"75 cl bottle. Pours hazy yellow with a small white head. Aroma is mild fruity, light phenolic and dry. Sweet fruity flavoured, light phenolic and mild yeasty. Smooth and lingering wineous into the finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
949,"2012-07-21",3.2,"750mL at RBSG brunch. Cloudy light orange pour with minimal head. Nose is sweet tangerine and candies. Small funky acetic notes. Taste is sharp and spritzy with a heavy malt presence. Doughy and pie crust heavy with caramel and toffee. Not really sour or wild. Just a small twang up front. Decent. Palate is a bit papery.

This golden pour has a slightly sweet vinuous nose; the influence of the wine barrel is noticeable.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
