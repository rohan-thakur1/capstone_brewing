2353,"2017-01-31",3.8,"Bottle. BBE date Oct 2010; Drank Jul 2010. Dark Brown in colour. Very Malty; roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee. Very Fruity; dried fruit, raisins, plums. Hoppy; spicy, peppery hops. Yeasty. Vinous. Alcohol quite noticeable. Belgian Strong in style but also rather like an Imperial Stout. Rich, smooth, silky and full palate.

2353,"2016-10-01",4.3,"Bottle at home, 33cl. Very dark red-brown colour, like a heavy red wine. Very little head which vanishes immediately. Carbonation is very minimal. Overall appearance is very much like heavy red wine. Aroma is reminiscent of a very sweet imperial stout: extremely sweet and caramelly, complex and with a heavy body, lots of dark malts, albeit not as roasty as an impy (roastiness is there but not pronounced). Some smoke. Maybe some hints of raisins and a bit boozy. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, smokey-sweet and very reminiscent of an imperial stout. Very smooth though. Taste is very heavy and complex, very sweet with distinct candi sugar and caramel notes. I definitely get some smoke but the dark malts rule supreme. Finishes very smooth but still boozy and very sweet. Excellent beer from maltus Faber, unlike most Belgian Strongs, this one seems a mixture between that style and an imperial stout.","SWITZERLAND","BenL8"

Caratteristiche olfattive che la collocano quasi in una posizione intermedia fra una trappista e una imperial stout (per alcune sue note vinose appena accennate ed altre leggermente asprigne); sentori di mela verde, uvetta, datteri e prugna disidratata. Al palato spicca per la sua nota dominante di liquirizia fusa e di malti tostati; non nasconde, da subito, i suoi 10° gradi alcolici, ma li avvolge e li completa con tutta una serie di altre chicche. E birra che scalda, ricca nellaroma (frutta secca, tostatura, caramello, liquirizia, caffè), note fruttate (di frutta sotto spirito ancor più evidente che allolfatto, uva sultanina), un cioccolato fondente marginale ma significativo, e quell asprigno da Imperial Stout.","roma, ITALY","leghorn99"

Dried and candied fruits in the mouth, vinous and oily, very agreeable mouthfeel, sherry-like accents but the coffee and chocolate qualities coming from deep, dark and roasted malts are dominant.

2353,"2008-08-11",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
This seductress of Dark Belgian-style  Strong Ales pleases with generous offerings of raisin-studded chocolate cakes, vinous alcohol helpings, and  peppery yeast decorations all while hypnotizing the tastebuds with its sensuously round and supple body.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam decorates the deepest brown.
-I also had the chance to taste a wonderful 3-year-old batch; a little maderization elevated the chocolatey caramel maltiness to superb heights and lengths. I gave ""3.9"" for the 1-year-old and ""4.3"" for the 3-year-old.
-This beer has more body than the Rocheforts, to give an example from the same beery family.
-Alcohol warming is beautiful with the  rich and proficient malt profile.
-The yeast seems to add a spicy, peppery touch to the finish.
-The nose is very complex and even more so in the 3-year-old version.
