935,"2015-12-14",4.0,"Pours thick orange amber with a big creamy light sandy white head. Aroma brings grapey straw malts and hops smooth in the nose. Couldnt describe the flavor better than they did above, but the hops have maintained a delicious presence even with time on it! Also the grape fruity tone in the finish is described to a tee, so pleasant on the palate. The hops are definitely in the forefront with the low ABV.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

Very smooth, crisp carbonation, super easy drinking. Medium body. Good toasty malt, nice snappy hop, some lemongrass type flavor to the hops. Moderate bitter, light sweet taste, light malty tingle.

935,"2013-11-15",3.5,"bottle. Golden with one finger head. Light malt body with caramel and some slightly earthy hops. Dry finish.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
935,"2013-11-08",3.7,"Bottle date is all messed up, so I have no idea when this was bottled, but it wasnt sooner than September, Im pretty sure. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.

Appearance: A hazy straw color... others would say it looks like piss. Two finger head falls to one, where it stays for awhile. Nice lacing. Pour semi-aggressively, so you can get it all into your glass perfectly. A really good looking beer.

Smell: Hay. Pale malts. Slightly grassy hops. Theres not much to it, but its certainly of quality. Nothing cheap here.

Taste/feel: Hay is the first flavor, followed by some of those pale malts, and then a surprising bit of hop bitterness. The very first thing I notice though is the mouthfeel -- this actually has a surprising body to it that I wasnt expecting. It drinks a bit heavier than 4.7%, and I like that. Aftertaste is slightly dry with a bit of a lingering bitterness. A slight prick of carbonation spruces things up on the end.

I havent had too many steam beers, and to be honest, I havent really liked any of the ones Ive tried. This beer seems a bit thicker than other ones Ive had, but I enjoy it more than some of them.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

935,"2013-11-02",3.3,"Pour from a 12 oz bottle. Clear deep gold brew with small head. Aroma dominated by grassy hops. Taste is sweeter malt at the start, a little salt(?), rather rough bitterness at the end of the swallow with a long lingering pilsener like bitter after taste. Its good but a little unbalanced.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","Onslow"

935,"2013-10-06",3.8,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 9/24/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and yeast ester notes with a fair amount of malt; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with good flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected for the ABV. Overall this is a very good hoppy California common style. All around good malt, hop, and yeast ester balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
935,"2013-10-02",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2014 Bottle: Bright yellow color, mostly clear with a mild chill haze. Decently long lasting, bone white head. Smells sheets of lacing near the top. Aroma is very light spicy hop, mild bready maltiness, and a bit of lager yeast with an accompanying DMS aroma. Simple, a little one dimensional. Taste is a bit more hoppy, slightly bitter. Hops seem more like Noble; leafy and a little musty, mildly bitter. Malt is understated, light and a bit bready in the finish. Clumpy lager yeast in the finish, too; crisp, though not as clean of a finish as desired. Similar to a more hopped up Anchor Steam... With a little less lager character.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

The aroma is quite understated with some citrusy and fruity hops, as well as a bit of grassiness and some bready malt.  Dry caramel malt flavors kick things off, then are joined by earthy hops. Midway through light citrus hop flavors enter in before drying out into a crisp and mildly bitter ending.  Medium body with tingly carbonation and a dry finish.","Lewes, Delaware, USA","ROGUE"
935,"2012-10-13",3.3,"Sampler at Shorts. Very clear orange-gold pour with a slight white head. Subtle nose of mainly herbal hops with dashes of pine and citrus in there, but not much. Pretty bitter flavor wise with just a pinch of sweetness. Lighter bodied, crisp, and refreshing palate. A nice little session brew, good for food pairings, but on its own perhaps a little lacking, especially with all that aggressive hopping. It shows up in the flavor, but not the nose so much. Of course, my nose was f-ed up all week, so that could be part of the problem.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
935,"2012-09-07",2.5,"Draft at brewery. Super hoppy nose but with a decent amount of malt that keeps it smelling like a traditional lager. The pout is golden. The taste is about the same as the smell. Would be a nice hot summer day brew.

Pours a richer golden orange hue, firm haziness overall with some richer glow, a lingering frothy offwhite head rings thicker, laces well. Aromas are fairly clean, a bit of bready malt, some straw, grass. Gentle fruit, but fairly mellow, nondescript, and clean. Initial is lighter end of the fold, earthy bitterness immediately upfront, florals and grass. Moves quickly into mellow bready malts, dough, some straw. Middle shows some more fruit, bits of pear and apple, more bread. Backend shows a bit more dryness, touch of tart green apple, some straw, grass, mellow bitterness into the finish. Grows on me through the experience. A bit bland up front, moving into a more enjoyable medium bitter finish with some nice fruity flourishes.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Sweet house malts that are charred and slightly bitter in the finish along with an herbal slightly spicy hop.
