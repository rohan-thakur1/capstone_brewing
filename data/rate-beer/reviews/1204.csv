1204,"2017-05-04",4.2,"Botella en 99 Cervezas.

De intensidad media en nariz, da de inmediato notas de plátano y malta tostada, algo de ciruela seca y un puntito licoroso de fondo, así como notas a castañas. Algunas notas florales y herbales, ambas muy de fondo. Complejidad media-alta y muy agradable en nariz.

Vierte en color castaño oscuro con un punto rojizo. Bastante transparente. La espuma es de abundancia media, con burbuja pequeña y persistencia moderada, presentando también buena adherencia.

Sorprendente en boca, con un sabor muy redondo en el que tienen protagonismo principal el dulce, el amargo y un punto de acidez, aunque los tres de manera muy equilibrada y suave. Lo maravilloso de esta cerveza es que resulta muy expresiva a pesar de esa suavidad. El retro-gusto da sobre todo notas malteadas, así como de plátano, aunque sean las primeras las que dominan. Las castañas también están presentes, ayudando muy bien a redondear el conjunto.

De cuerpo medio y textura sorprendentemente frizante, resulta muy fácil de beber. No es nada cargante (como pasa con alguna otra Doppelbock de mayor fama y menos categoría). Pide enseguida dar un nuevo sorbo y cuando estos se acumulan en boca, esta se sigue sintiendo ligera. Y eso manteniendo una presencia en boca suave pero sabrosa. Persistencia media y final muy equilibrado entre dulce y seco.

1204,"2017-04-17",4.3,"Had the beer as part of the Saveur Bière easter set. The beer looks delicious. The color of the beer is a very dark brown. On the naked eye it almost looks black. A strong light reveals a nice nice dark amber glow. Nice. On top of the beer a nice rough layer of greyish-brown foam. The majority of the foam collapses rather quickly, leaving a thin drape. Nice. 
The smell of the beer is also nice. It is a proper bockbier. I smell nice rather sweet malt aromas, a bit bready even. There is also a nice aroma of syrup, plums, caramel and toffee and some alcohol. The smell is very warming. The smell is quite sweet, because of the strong lovely malt aromas, but there also is a nice slight bitterness of the hops. I also smell a nice yeasty touch, giving a certain doughiness. The smell of the beer gets stronger after the beer warms up. Where it was quite mild at the start, it is very warming and rich at the end.
The taste of the beer also is nice. It contains a lovely warm maltiness. I taste plums, dark fruit, toffee, syrup, brown sugar and caramel. It tastes very full. I like the nice bitter hoppy touch. Not clear hops, but a nice bitter touch to break the mainly sweet flavours. The beer also contains a nice alcohol flavour. Very nice flavour. It is rich and sweet and full. Even though the beer is mainly sweet, it is not to sweet. The hop bitterness is able to balance out the sweetness perfectly. Very well done. I understand this beer is number one in its style. 
The palate of the beer is nice. Full body, smooth texture and a nice medium high bitterness. The finish is nice, and contains a lovely alcohol warmth and a nice hoppy bitterness, to balance out the sweets an extra time. Very well done.","Capelle aan den IJssel, NETHERLANDS","Gangstergafje"

Strong malty aroma with dark fruit and hints of chocolate and coffee. No detectable hop aroma. More malt and dark fruit flavor and even stronger chocolate, creating a kind of chocolate covered raisin flavor. The dark fruit is definitely not overpowering, in fact the flavor is almost ephemeral: disappearing from the pallet quickly after finishing. No hop flavor is detectable. The finish itself is somewhat sweet but not cloying, with very low bitterness and a small amount of alcohol flavor. Medium full body with low carbonation.

Winterbock: 8/4/9/5/16 // Total of 4.2 - Pours a dark, reddish brown with a medium, creamy, beige head. Promising aroma of red berries and dark malt, without being too roasty. Deep, fruity coffee notes, and hints of toffee, woody, hazelnut. A bit of alcohol in the back, but not boozy. Taste is lightly sweet, lightly bitter. Straight and very well balanced. Silky, slender medium body with soft carbonation. An excellent brew. Feels almost light. Very smooth and just expertly balanced. Great.

Celebrator: 7/4/8/3/13 // Total of 3.5 - Identical in terms of appearance, different in aroma, taste and palate. Aroma is more ""preserved"", not as fresh as the Winterbock.

 Kolor:  Brązowy. W 100% klarowny trunek. 
 Piana:  Żółto-kremowa, drobnoziarenkowa, przekształca się w duże i średnie ziarenka.
Opada dość szybko. Na szczęście gruby kołnierzyk pozostaje nad piwem. Po przechyleniu kufelka pozostają na jego ściankach liczne zacieki. Ostania warstewka cały czas wisi nad piwem. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest bardzo przyjemny. Na początku intensywna czekolada, ciasteczka kruche, odrobina melasy.
Troszeczkę niżej w hierarchii - nutki melanoidowe (tosty, przypieczona skórka od chleba, ciemne pieczywo).
Z dalej po nosie biją także niuanse przypominające ciastko typu brownie i odrobinę orzechów laskowych.
Jest słodko i zachęcająco. 
 Smak:  W smaku melanoidy budują zdecydowaną słodową bazę. Dominuje ciemne pieczywo, tosty, toffi i odrobina karmelu. 
Nie brakuje nut kruchych ciasteczek i odrobiny mlecznej czekolady.

 Wysycenie:  Wysokie.
 Podsumowanie:  

Celebrator to najlepszy Doppelbock na świecie.
Uwarzony przez browar Ayinger z miejscowości o tej samej nazwie - Aying.

Siła tego piwa polega na tym, że niby niczym szczególnym nie zaskakuje, ot taki nudny styl Doppelbock, a pijalność ma ogromną.
Okazuje się jednak, że ten na pozór nudny styl może być ciekawy.
Celebrator wydaje się nie wprowadzać w stan uniesienia, ale znika ze szkła nieprawdopodobnie szybko.
Piwo napompowane jest stylowymi elementami takimi jak: czekolada, melanoidy, tosty, ciemne pieczywo, przypieczona skorka chlebowa, toffi, karmel, orzechy.

In the aroma, I picked up on primarily prunes, raisins, dried fruit in general, as well as molasses/brown sugar. Beneath this is a mixture of bread, malts, honey, and caramel. It produced a two finger beige coloured head. The taste definitely reminded me of prunes, dried fruit, blackcurrant, nuts too and cocoa in the background. It has a mature, thick sweetness especially on entrance and goes into a roasty bitterness. Quite tingley at the end which leaves a smokey savoury-ness after swallowing.

Smells of warmed toffee, together with dried plums, a smoky whiff and walnut shell. On top of this foundation settles earth coated liquorice, molasses and balancing whole grain bread. 

Has a velvet mouthfeel to it, with a medium carbonation and a silk, malt defined smoothness throughout. 

Tastes of burned toffee, molasses and caramel, outstandingly well balanced by bitter, dry earth. Its bitterness reveals coffee dregs among an herbal, leafy dryness. Adds a soft dried fruit quality to the flavors, with rock sugar creating a short, sweet peak after the swallow. Nontheless, its world class mouthfeel maintains, due to an aqueous quality soothing the sweetness, creating a transition for the well nuanced bitterness, slowly developing from its earthy foundation. This enables a clean finish, with a brief, toffee coated finish. 

Quite complex and pleasantly challenging, as the beer denies the palate to drown solely in sugary malts. Instead, it features a great grassiness of matured hops and bready earth, all mellowed by a world class mouthfeel, ensuring an utmost clean finish.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1204,"2015-09-28",4.9,"Ayinger. How Ive missed you. And how Ive looked forward to meeting Celebrator. Whats with the excessively formal language? I guess this is what German beer does to me. Pouring dark brown with an off-white head, Celebrator looks like a perfectly photogenic Doppelbock. It smells like caramel, malt sugar, and toasted malt. Flavor is complex, malt-forward, and dessert-like. Brown sugar, dark fruit, and subtle cocoa. Thanks to the velvet-smooth feel, the latter flavor element made me think of cake. Seems damn fitting if you ask me. Cake and beer are celebration staples. And this brew is good enough to somehow embody both.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Entra con non molte bollicine, molto fini ed eleganti, e il corpo ha una buona struttura ma non è pesante la bevuta. Al gusto i malti tostati si traducono in buone note di caramello iniziali, e man mano vanno verso il tostato, passando prima e di nuovo per il cacao per finire con la liquirizia, nota che caratterizza questa birra in prevalenza.

Dense caramel, sweet brown sugar, raisins, plums, heavy molasses, milled & charred grains, burnt toast, a touch of wine, & a bit of soy sauce in the latter half. Alcohol is pretty noticeable on the palate with a good amount of boozy sting to it. Feels heftier than 6.7% ABV. Lots of dark fruit meshes with the alcohol gives a mild wine-like flavor up front that transitions into a very sweet mid-palate. Molasses, syrup, black licorice, anise, char, & strong, rustic dry cocoa underneath. Lots of toasted caramel & burnt toffee in the finish, too, with a little bit of an herbal character from the hops... Almost tea leafy at times.

1204,"2014-11-13",4.3,"12 oz bottle, poured into a tulip at approximately 45 degrees F.

A: Pours like a heavy molten caramel, and settles into the glass a deep, rich ruby brown, like a well-worn bit of mahogany furniture. Holding the glass to daylight reveals burnished copper-bronze highlights and the faint shadows of fingers on the opposite side of the glass, with bubbles streaming merrily by. The head is impressively thick and foamy, a beige color, which leaves rather persistent and thorough lacing down the glass.

S: Warm baked bread, sprinkled with crumbles of toffee and drizzled with sweet caramel, open the aroma. Lurking beneath the malt bouquet are some fruity notes, like currants and dates with a suggestion of plum. The nose is yeasty, malty, and warm.

T: That is, in fact, a liquid loaf of brown bread, dunked in caramel and molasses, then dipped in toffee as if breading it for frying. While the previously mentioned fruit hints are present, if deeply buried, there is a distinct note like old leather and an almost chicory sort of bite as it goes along. Towards the finish, there is a bitterness not unlike a varnished wood, which fades into a molasses sweetness during some sips, and lingers as a wooden bitterness with others. As the beer warms, the odd bitter notes fade into the background, allowing the sweet, rich, and complex malt to star unmolested, and allowing the currant-date notes to come more forward.

M: Full, rich, and sticky, this beer clings to every mouth surface. Theres a sharpness from the carbonation, which seems a wee bit heavy to me.

O: Given the wooden and slightly earthy notes this doppelbock carries, I understand why many tout it as the best of the doppelbock line. I am in no way suggesting this is undeserved, nor that this is a poor quality beer in any way, shape, or form, but it is not my favorite doppelbock as a devout malthead. The odd notes that seem like hops trying to come a little too forward for my liking cut down on my enjoyment - when I want a doppelbock, I want glorious, unrelenting malt and associated flavors, not anything trying to balance or even display hop flavors. Hence, my rating this beer below other doppelbocks, in spite of my unabashed Privatbraurei Aying fanboyism.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

1204,"2014-11-08",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2017 From the bottle at Bräustüberl Aying. Finally. Beautiful black appearance with small grey head that becomes a ring soon (edit: when you pour it not as carefully as the waiters there do, the foam is huge!)  Aroma is complex and balanced, malty, coffeeish, bready. Taste is amazingly smooth, with roasted malts, bitter espresso, bread, not sweet or boozy at all. Smooth creamy mouthfeel - a bit watery maybe, but not irritating - and a rather dry finish which is still a bit warming. A bit of chocolate remaining. Low carbonation. Very balanced from the beginning to the end. Super Doppelbock!

As Winterbock at Ayingers am Platzl. From the memory, I?d say it?s more fruity and more intense than Celebrator, but I?ll have to try them side by side.

Did try them side by side at the Bräustüberl - indeed, Celebrator is drier and the Winterbock is more fruit-forward. However, it seems as though they have the same recipe, just different Lagering. More investigation to come.

1204,"2014-07-25",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2014 Famous Bavarian Doppelbock, one of the references in its style.  Thick, dense and regular, light beige head leaving some lacing on the edges; colour a very dark wine red, clear with no visible fizz.  Charming, assertive malt aroma, cookies, toasted brown bread, dough, molasses, freshly grated nutmeg, butterscotch, cocoa powder, dried banana, raisins, liquorice, Irish coffee, figs, dried leaves, iron, biscuit, sweet tobacco, hint of brandy and something meaty.  In the mouth a dried fruitiness kicks off, sweetish but nowhere cloying or sugary, dried plums and dried apricots, slick and somewhat fatty mouthfeel, finely tingling carbonation, on a very pure, deep and layered maltiness of caramel, walnuts, bitter chocolate and in the end some gentle roasted, coffee-like bitterness, spreading over the tongue, accompanied by a leafy, German hop bitterness and warming, agreeable, brandy-like alcohol which in all remains quite well hidden (i.e. does not become prevalent).  I would not say this is the best German beer I ever had, but if I had to introduce any beer neophyte to the ""dunkler Doppelbock"" style, Id go for this (or Andechser Doppelbock, perhaps).  In any case, this remains a great classic and a beautiful illustration of the true meaning of maltiness in beer.  Elegant, warming and very rewarding.

1204,"2014-07-18",3.8,"330 ml bottle with custom plastic Bock pendant bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen.
Looks: Opague Cola black colour; One-quarter finger head and beige foam which fades in 30 seconds; Small sticky lacing with zero carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant, sweet and rich dark malt which can be smelt as soon as it was popped, with strong caramel, toffee, coffee, brown sugar, light cream, roasted nuts and faint grass.

Taste: Mid to light sweet dark malt, with very strong roastyness, light nuts, shades of smoke, caramel, light toffee, veruy light dark fruits, light Cola, molasses, very light black coffee, very light lemon and very light bitter hops and faint grass.

Body: Mid to light; Slick and smooth palate. 

Mouth Feel: Stout-like dark malt in a moderate to thin body with superb roastyness - probably the most roastiest dark malt Ive tasted so far - plus light roasted nuts, matching caramel and toffee. Black coffee and cream are light. Good light molasses, Cola background. This is a Doppelbock proper, but more akin to a good Stout. Wooooo!...

Hoppiness: Faint grass nose, very light lemon and faint grassy taste. Bitterness is fairly low-fi in background, match well with roastyness and sweetness for a nice low-bitter finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Very easy to mouth.

Comments: This is really unique among most Doppelbocks: its aroma, taste, looks, body and palate really resembles how a nice Stout should end up and tasted. Its roastyness takes the centre stage and clicks with all other light elements. If you are expecting something like Paulaner Salvator or other sweet strong Doppelbock then you are in for a surprise.

1204,"2014-07-06",4.1,"This beer is the real deal German Doppelbock, ""-ator"" ending and all from visual appeal to taste. Packaging is beautiful with the dark brown bottle as backdrop for the light blue label punctuated by the amber-red glass of beer. The finishing touch which I love (see picture) is the small goat hung from a red thread--just a classy finishing touch to say ""were really proud of our product."" Very eye catching. Beautiful nearly black, amber color so inviting with the creamy tan head, washes smoothly, beautifully over the tongue very complex but well blended flavors with ever so slight chocolaty notes to me, some bitterness on finish but not overpowering. The only thing that detracted for me a bit, resulting in a slightly lower aroma score, was the aroma upon finishing the pour--it was slightly--no other word for it--""tin canny."" Ever so slight but just noticeable. It did not in any way come through in the actual taste of the beer and was then indistinguishable by half way through the glass of beer (drunk from a stemmed, rounded belly goblet that allows aromas to experienced well). This was my first tasting so it may have been an aberration. Aside from that aspect, which I cant call ""very minor"" since, for me, the pre-first drink aroma experience is part of the overall experience, the beer is superb.

On top sits a tight head of light brown foam which slowly settles down to small cap that hangs on till the last sip. Lacing is slick and slides right down the glass as I drink. In the nose I get notes of sweet caramel, fresh sweet bread, ripe fruit and a kiss of German hops. The flavor has a sweet overall character with moderate hoping that comes through in the end to finish things up without becoming too sweet or cloying. Up front are the caramel candy, brown sugar, light molasses and brown pear like fruit notes. Towards the finish bready notes become more toasted and mix with some light hop flavors to temper the overall sweetness. The finish is short and still on the sweet side but in a good way. Carbonation is lively enough to lift the palate of the solid, smooth, and full body and leave you wanting that next sip.","New York, USA","generallee08"

1204,"2014-06-14",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 5-4-12-
 Poured from 330 ml bottle into tulip shaped glass

Appearance  Pours a thick looking deep brown color with a large off-white head. The head had big carbonation bubbles entrapped within and faded quite fast. Upon fading it left a persistent film on the surface of the brew.

Smell  A big bready brown bread aroma with strong roasted malts aromas. Mixed in with the breadiness there is a nice sweetness of molasses and brown sugar rounding out the roast very nicely.

Taste  A thick bready base with big roasted malt flavors greets the tongue nicely. The taste begins a little on the drier side and sweetness as notes of brown sugar and molasses enter the scene. At the end, the roastiness, when mixed with the sweet creates a somewhat sweetened coffee flavor. This brew has some very nice transitions and all the flavors at all times complement each other very nicely. Fantastic.

Mouthfeel  Quite a creamy body with a lower level of carbonation. With this the flavors really have a chance to sit on the tongue and really permeate the taste buds. A very soothing and wonderful mouthfeel

Overall  Smooth in body and taste transitions with great flavors and aromas. This is one great drinking beer.","","Darkmagus82"

1204,"2014-04-27",3.9,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance was a black/brown colored body with a slim half finger white foamy head that quickly dies and barely leaves any lacing.
The smell had a roasty rich maltiness, light chocolate, and a little bit of molasses, some toffee is noted as it warms a bit.
The taste was mainly sweet - malty sweet that is, malty aftertaste, dry finish.
On the palate, it sat about a medium, and was kinda sessionable. Carbonation is felt - kinda sharp (but honestly I dont do as many doppelbocks so Im unsure how close to the style as it should be).
Overall, I say this is dessert in a bottle. I picked the right time of the day to have this and the right time of the year to make the moment perfect. Im glad I tried it and I would have this again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1204,"2014-03-11",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2014 12 oz bottle poured into a shaker. While theres still a huge fluffy head, the aromas are mostly that of chocolate malt, vanilla, and, generally, chocolate chip cookie dough. As the head recedes, so does the chocolate and dough, but the vanilla sticks around with a fresh baked crusty bread. Some dark fruits, like figs, and grapes, start to come through along with licorice and caramel. It pours a dark, clear caramel color and is topped by a dense, effervescent micro-bubble head that has a very gelatin-like look to it. A decent head remains and it leaves an abundant small-bubbled lace down the glass. The medium leveled malty sweetness is balanced nicely by a light, subtle, toasty bitterness. The medium-full, rich body has a creamy, syrupy texture to it, aided by the light, fizzy, but abundant carbonation. The mouth feel starts with a malty, fig-y, cola flavor. As it warms, caramel, dark chocolate, and raisin start to come through. The final flavor reminded me quite a bit of a bridge mix - even a bit of a roasted nut flavor came through, but I couldnt tell if it was actually there and hence I made the bridge mix connection, or I made the bridge mix connection, then imposed a roasted nut flavor. The finish is roasted nut, dark chocolate, and toasted caramel. The dark chocolate and toasted bread, in particular, along with a mellow caramel note, linger in the aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

On top sit s thick creamy tan head of foam that s cloud like and loathe to fall. It finally does but leaves wet lace dripping down the glass with each sip. 

Nose is intense. First the most authentic scent of blackstrap molasses. With that earthy little sour to it like if you had put your nose int he jar of it. Dark fruits and fresh plum. Behind that a treasure of dark dried fruits like raisin and prune. bit of caramel and a dark and breaddy malt that is toasted perfectly. Toasted bread and you can almost smell the crusts. Theres a whiff of alcohol but it is not unwelcome and a light spice. Smells like a pastry made with lots of dark fruits and nuts. 

Taste is fat chewy and velvety malt. Toasty and breaddy. Glides over the tongue with all that fruit and the creamy molasses. Theres a touch of hops on this and they are bitter but not too much. Endless and smooth. creamy with dark sugars and toasted grains. Theres a touch herbal in the drink and the body is round, full and fat. Finishes with a delightfully authentic aftertaste of molasses. 

This beer is perfection in every way. its rich and delicious. Smooth and forthcoming. It drinks sticky and has a complex palate that has just the right amount of sour and bitter to offset its deep sweetness.

1204,"2013-03-30",4.5,"Pours medium to dark brown, with lighter brown edges, where light passes through. This beer looks remarkably like a cola. The foamy head, the carbonation bubbles that accumulate on the side of the glass and the lighter brown glints around the bottom and edges of the glass are reminiscent of a glass of brown cola. The aroma is rich and quite large. Horehound candy, sorghum, prunes, and heavy brown sugar characterize the nose. The flavor is so big its nearly vulgar. I said nearly. There was still quite a bit of a tact employed in stopping just short of over the top. It is almost like drinking liquid candy. I respect this beer for how bold it is, if for no other reason at all. Ive had imperial stouts and barleywines with less personality. All of this big malty flavor at only 6.7% ABV. Probably because the beer was engineered in a fashion to retain more unfermentable sugars. I detect some chocolate liqueur, brown sugar, and prunes. Theres just the faintest bitterness at the finish to help offset the sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied with very little scrubbing on the tongue. This is not necessarily a style that Id say is in my wheelhouse, but I do appreciate this beer. I wish it wasnt $14.99 a four-pack. Otherwise, Id keep it in my fridge all the time as an alternative to port wine for an after dinner dessert drink.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"

Appearance: The body is a dark chestnut hue with light only visible through the edges. A thin tan head rises from the body with average retention, but settles into a thick coating.

Taste: This is malty and fruity with a thick malt sweetness in the mid-taste with cherries and a slightly medicinal grape flavor on the finish.
Palate: Full bodied with sharp carbonation.
Overall: This is hurt a lot in points for two reasons. The first is the very restrained aroma. I find it hard to coax any aroma out of here even upon swirling. Secondly there is no freshness date to allow me to know whether this is old, and it likely is.

Aroma is full of malt. Lots of caramel, toffee, and burnt sugar along with an almost soy sauce like character but it is not off-putting. A touch of chocolate as well.

The flavor is very heavy on the burnt sugar/caramel but it doesnt become astringent. This leads to some milk chocolate and a touch of coffee and toast. A little hop bitterness towards the finish but it is far in the background. Malt dominates. Mouthfeel is full and sticky/sweet but stays just below being cloying.

S: Toasted malt, sweet caramels, smoke. Very inviting, this smells like a world class doppelbock, which it certainly is.

T: Extremely tasty, with a subtle rauchbier / smoke flavor about it. A pleasant sweetness sneaks in among the smoke and toasted malt, but only enough to make the beer delectable, not cloying in the least. Toffee and bread with a splash of dark fruit are in there as well. This beer is so delicious and still very accessible, which I find very pleasing.

1204,"2012-04-09",4.0,"A: Pours a dark yet lustrous ruby color, with a one finger off white head with unimpressive retention/lacing.

S: Rich dark fruit combined with some dark chocolate and a bit of licorice. An excellent smell.

T: Not quite as impressive as the smell would let on, but its still excellent, for the most part. Theres dark fruit, some caramel, toffee, chocolate, and licorice. All told, its pretty complex and flavorful - but I think that the chocolate flavors clash with the malt base a little more than they should. ABV is well hidden.

M: It has a medium-to-slightly-heavy body with high carbonation - though perhaps less smoothness than Id like. Also has a somewhat brief, fleeting finish.

O: The way I see it, if this is like a brilliant painting of the Last Supper, then Troegs Troegenator is like an ordinary but well executed painting of Monica Belucci - I can really appreciate the artful precision that went into making this, but Id take the Monica Belucci painting instead. Likewise, though it isnt as complex as Celebrator, Id rather have Troegenator. Dont get me wrong, though, this is a great beer either way.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Rich on the palate, it tastes far stronger than the abv, particularly when the deep, sticky finish arrives. Sweet caramel and toffee is the predominant flavour  the fact that theres little alcohol on the palate I found really positive, so many beers like this (from the US, mostly) pile on the booze and it rounds out the flavour  Celebrator has a much more complex finish.

1204,"2012-02-29",4.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/25/2010.  Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a tulip.

Celebrator has a  dark mahogany color with a fair amount of room for ruby to peer through in more narrow parts of the glass. A dark copper color sneaks into the very edge of the glass.

A very smooth aroma with components that work well together. Soft sweet molasses, some dates and spicy, herbal hoppy notes. Sweet bready notes round things out.

Chewy caramel malt flavor starts out the flavor, followed with a touch of molasses, then some spiced bread as the body fills out in my mouth. Some dates step in before a touch of herbal bitterness sets in for a second. The end of the sip approaches, telling the grain and sweetness to wrap up the show in a polite fashion. Finishes clean and a touch sweet. 

This is an absolute perfect feel. I can feel the little bubbles actually raise up off of my tongue, keeping it fresh for the next sip. Creamy, medium bodied. Sexy.

1204,"2012-02-13",4.1,"Bottle. The best double bock out there. And you get a little plastic goat to hang somewhere odd. Im all about beers that come with a trinket of some type. The pour was a velvety dark brown, way darker than Troegenator or other double bocks, with a decent size head, half inch or so, that faded to a white ring. The scent was a malty caramel with hints of resin, and the heavy palate had a creamy texture that set it off nicely from the body. The taste was a strong biting malt that settled into more of a cereal and fruit noted flavor with a alcohol woody aftertaste. Even though this is 6.7%, I still cellared one. I think a year of age will bring down the aftertaste a little and boost the malt complexities. Well see.

1204,"2011-12-13",4.0,"Bought as Ayinger Winter Bock. WOW! This just might be my favorite among the Christmas brews at Systembolaget. Pours a very dark brown, against a light its slightly reddish.

Sweet, yet intense - you just know this will taste good. And taste doesnt let it down. Opens up with a sweet, slightly chocolatey flavor. Syrup, bread (again), a touch of caramel. Sweet, yet very sturdy. Moving into the fairly long finish, theres a slight bitterness thats very controlled and never takes the upper hand. This could potentially become too sweet a concoction but the carbonation is just high enough to keep it in check, giving it a freshness that makes it very drinkable.

Aroma:  Mash, lots of rich, deep malt aromas  molasses, dark dried fruits, treacle, brown sugar, dark rum, lighter chocolate notes, burnt sugar hints, some dark rye bread crust, hints of vanilla and root beer notes, pretty unctuous stuff.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, moderate, somewhat sparse effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Much like the nose, with plenty of big, thick malt flavours, a touch metallic, mash, molasses, brown sugar, dark dried fruits, burnt sugar, dark rye bread, some hints of cola-like herbals, quite good; almost dry with limited bitterness and a pleasant brown/burnt sugar and rye crust finish.

The flavour is moderately sweet throughout with roasted malts, coffee, molasses, pepper and spice, along with a touch of hops. The finish is long and surprisingly dry and smoky. On the palate, it is medium in body with a creamy texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent doppelbock with a delicate, roasty character.

It pours a tantalizing black/brown with ruby edges, the head doesnt last long but while it does its light tan and fragrantly frothy - as it fades it leaves little islands behind, but not really lacing.

The smell is of dark-fruited malts and with a tinge of smoke and perhaps a bit of light soy sauce. It tastes of cherry, dry cocoa, vanilla, soy sauce with a warming dark alcoholic taste. The aftertaste lasts with a nice bittersweet quality. Long into the aftertaste a grassy black licorice taste emerges - after at least a minute.

Maybe I will favorite this one.

Geschmacklich ist es dann auch leicht cremig, dazu röstmalzig-dunkelmalzig und süßlich, soweit ganz gut aber eine Aromenkombination ist noch vorhanden, die mir in diesem Fall nicht so gelungen scheint: bitter-pflaumig-leicht alkoholisch.

1204,"2011-07-31",3.5,"(33 cl bottle from Bayersk.dk) In celebration of my rating #100 on Ratebeer I decided to try the best Doppelbock and the best Baltic Porter in the world (both with percentiles of 100 within and outside the style). Pours a clear but dark copper with rich, toffee head that laces the glass heavily. Aroma is complex. I detect toasted malts and what seems to me to be a hint of cherry, raisin, dust and bread? The texture is quite special. I dont think I ever tasted a beer that felt so silky before. It is very light and tender on the tongue - probably due to the aging. The carbonation is soft and the brew is medium-bodied with a dry finish. In the taste I find nuts and fruity malts. It has a sweetness of character but far more subdued and refined than more simple brews and well balanced out by nutty flavours and a very subtle hint of smoke. The celebrator is a very refined specimen in the Bock genre that I found a bit rash up until now. This is a very gentle, smooth and drinkable brew.","DENMARK","humlelala"

1204,"2011-07-16",4.3,"Im not normally a fan of doppelbocks, but as you can tell from my rating, Ayinger Celebrator ranks among the best beers. So if a beer of a style Im not partial to can knock my socks off - what does that say about the beer?I poured a 12oz bottle into a tumbler.Appearance: Pretty hue of dark maroon, almost purple, with a perfectly-proportioned tan, foamy head. The head sticks around until the bitter end and leaves some lacing on the glass.Smell: Many of the same scents I get in a dark Trappist ale I get here: raisin, fruitcake, rum, and a bit of cough medicine.Taste: Perhaps I should just ""copy and paste"" my tasting notes of certain Belgian Trappist beers since Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock seems to have many of the same flavors. As we noted in the aroma, dark fruits and confectionary flavors are strong here. Fruitcake, rum, raisin, and toffee syrup are all prominent from start to finish. Its a rich, sweet beer to be sure, but its never cloying or sticky. It finishes with a subtle, semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste to impart some bitterness and let you know its still a beer.Mouthfeel: The first thing I noticed about this beer even before the flavor was just how soft and gentle it was in the mouth. This is like getting a hug from a teddy bear.Drinkability: Theres no carbonation sensation, nor is the beer obese - its perfectly medium-bodied. Not a refreshing beer, obviously, so its not quite in league of a summer seasonal (bear in mind this beer IS a lager, not an ale). Its so darn soft and tasty that its difficult not to drink it as fast as possible.Overall, this is a pretty amazing beer I wasnt expecting to like nearly as much as I did. I think most beer drinkers will be pleasantly surprised by it as well.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1204,"2011-03-01",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2011 3/1/2011 Bottle.  One-finger solid, sandy head that dissolves in two minutes to a thinning, sandy layer over a dark red body with a lot of lacing from the head to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is a complex of sour doughy, yeasty - like uncooked bread - but also notes of something sweet and deep-roasted and basement aromas.  In contrast, the taste is roasted and lightly bitter.  There is an undertone of very good, sweet rum.  But theres a bitter finish like drinking roasted peanuts.
This beer in a 11.2 oz bottle with the mere 6.7% ABV is finely-crafted and all good.  
Aroma 6/10, Appearance 4/5, Taste 7/10, Palate 4/5, Overall 17/20 = 3.8

12/5/11 - Conducted an experiment to compare the bottle with the draught.

Bottle.  Let this one sit before drinking.  Same as above except head dissolves faster and lacing not so covering and sticky but for a ring of lacing.  And aroma is well-baked nut bread and delicious.  Taste is sweet.  Palate is lively and full.  Rating is entry of display.
Aroma 9/10, Appearance 3/5, Overall 18/20.  Total =4.1

Draught 8oz.  Let this one sit.  Same as most recent bottle except lacing is frostier than either bottle.  Aroma is much weaker - coffee, mild candy, mild basement, roastiness, and a tobacco note.  Palate kind of creamy with an abrupt finish.   This compares to other Ayinger Celebrator draughts - does not measure up to the bottle.  Leaving bottle rating as more popular and representative.  Rating is close to bottle of March:

Pours into may small mug with a nice off white head and a dark brown body with hints of red.

This one smells different from the other doppelbock imports. It is what Orval is to the trappist beers. It is mostly raisin on the nose, almost exclusively, with some caramel. There is just something weird about it.

It tastes doppelbock enough, and it is pretty awesome. There are hints of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, dark fruits, and an interesting yeast kick. It is pretty sweet.

The mouthfeel is pretty good although the drinkability could be higher.

It is a good doppelbock but Salvator reigns supreme in my mind.

Taste: Bready malt and a faint hint of chocolate up front followed by caramel malt and dried fruit in the middle middle then finishing with a mix of nuttiness and hoppy bitterness. Aftertaste mildly sweet with a bit of bitterness. Extremely well balanced. Delicious.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very smooth and somewhat creamy.

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol is completely hidden by the excellent flavor.

Overall: Excellent beer overall. Arguably the best doppelbock in the world. You cant go wrong with this beer. Buy it.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

The finish is nicely malty, but otherwise beautifully clean.  The beer seems to achieve a flavor profile and level of drinkability that is seldom seen with other examples of the style.  Overall, clearly the benchmark against which all other examples must be measured; enjoyable in the extreme.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

A - Dark mahogany with deep ruby and slightly orange hues on the edges. Slightly larger than average size, sticky, frothy, khaki colored head. Nice retention leaving a nice, thick, creamy layer of lace.

S - Dark bread aromas with a good amount of burnt molasses and brown sugar. A touch of licorice with plenty of dark fruit similar to other Doppelbocks with a slight touch of tart aroma. Nice touch of spice and herbal aroma in the background.

T - A good amount of burnt brown sugar/molasses with lots of toasted dark bread. Big kick of spice (mostly clove and pepper but others) mid sip with a good amount of grassy and herbal hop flavors with a touch of bitterness. Nutty and earthy flavors also come out mid sip. Some dark fruit (plum, fig, date, touch of raisin) provides a background taste through out. Also a slight tartness with that fruity flavor. Perfectly balanced flavors.

M - Medium body with a lot of carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy, but could use just a touch more for the style. Touch of a drying finish.

D - Pretty drinkable beer with perfectly balanced flavors. Only thing that really holds it back is the slightly sweet and drying finish.

Notes: Very good beer and a great example of a Doppelbock. Perfectly balanced with the dark bread, dark fruit, nut/earth, brown sugar/molasses, and spice with a good kick of hops, bitterness, sweetness, and tartness. Quite a lovely beer that I would definitely recommend.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

1204,"2010-08-01",4.3,"Burnt amber and garnet drown in a sea of browns and blacks while a cappuccino head hovers with little lace to speak of at the moment. As I admire my Celebrator sitting pretty in a proper Ayinger Celebrator bock glass, I fall in love once more as her bouquet of aromas reach my nose. Black fruits, burnt caramel, black strap molasses, figs, dates, prunes, licorice root, cherries with their stones, black plums, and apples. Phew! None dominates the other; instead they weave in and out of the other with subtle finesse. Of course, in a balanced doppel-bock, this is what you want. We may be old friends, but that doesnt mean I am any less eager to dive in. Creamy and light sweetness evolves into tart prunes and black-skinned plums. A bitter finish is charred wood and burnt sugars. The middle of her palate is the heaviest while her front and finish are lighter on the senses. Truffle powder and bakers chocolate are wispy after-images and in my breath there is a faint kiss of boozy warmth. Imperial by no means, Celebrator is still a doppel-bock which means a more pronounced ABV than the standard bock. Black licorice and black strap molasses offer an earthy presence while someone somewhere is smoking a cigar. It all sounds complicated, but her palate caresses my tastebuds with ease, each flavor melding, melting, and weaving into the other. It should come as no surprise then that even with tasting notes, my glass empties rather quickly.


The Ayinger Celebrator was my first doppel-bock and is still my favorite, of that style at least. A little known fact about bocks in general is they are part of the lager family. Dark, light, I dont really care. Its about flavor, and Celebrator is where it is at for this style.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1204,"2010-03-30",4.8,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle into a stange glass. The back label lists the abv at 6.7% however there is no freshness date. 

Appearance: The body has a very dark brown color in the glass and when held up to light it has nice garnet highlights. Some small bubbles of carbonation can be seen in the highlights and near the edges of the glass. On top sits a tight head of light brown foam which slowly settles down to small cap that hangs on till the last sip. Lacing is slick and slides right down the glass as I drink.

Smell: In the nose I get notes of sweet caramel, fresh sweet bread, ripe fruit and a kiss of German hops.

Taste/Palate: The flavor has a sweet overall character with moderate hoping that comes through in the end to finish things up without becoming too sweet or cloying. Up front are the caramel candy, brown sugar, light molasses and brown pear like fruit notes. Towards the finish bready notes become more toasted and mix with some light hop flavors to temper the overall sweetness. The finish is short and still on the sweet side but in a good way. Carbonation is lively enough to lift the palate of the solid, smooth, and full body and leave you wanting that next sip.

Notes: All I need to say here is outstanding!!! When I think about Doppelbock beer this is the beer I will think of and compare all others to.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

Not one and then another but all as once like a symphony in my mouth. It also had a nice crisp finish. This was one of the best features as many doppelbocks leave too much sweet aftertaste because they finish syrupy.  On a cold winter night like the one I had last night I would definitely crack one or two of these open again!","Connecticut, USA","matmatmat"

While I still like this quite a bit, I find it lacking in the richness of both aroma and flavor as compared to others of the style.","Idaho, USA","TLNash886"

1204,"2009-11-16",4.4,"Aroma of sweet cherries and malt possibly some other sugars in there too. There was little head to mine which may be the way that I poured the bottle into the glass but left a light foam on top and the color of the head/remnant foam was an amber color. Color of the beer was a dark amber or red but definitely on the darker side then the picture assumes. It had a sweet and bitter cherry taste slightly with a mix of chocolate (probably Munich malt coming through) and was light on the palate and a little dry but not to bad. Overall, it is one of the best bottles Ive had and on tap it was equally if not more impressive. Enjoy sparingly like a nice treat that you dont want to ruin though.","Delaware, USA","geofbaum"

I poured it into an over-sized Arrogant Bastard glass and realized the glass was just like the Celebrator glass, only huge. It was a serious dark brown, with ruby edges and a frothy tan head. The smell was roasty, toasty, and malty. The taste was toasty and I swear I detected licorice in there. This was a good beer but I think it tastes better on tap. It is also a little pricey at $3 for 11oz. Still, one of the best German beers I have tried.

Finishes dry for such a malty bier, very drinkable.  Perfectly bittered for balance.  Wonderful viscosity, not too thick or thin, again aids in the drinkability.  Overall an enjoyable bier, easy to see why its the top rated Doppelbock.  Very drinkable, reminiscent of a good scotch ale without the smokey notes.","Clinton, Mississippi, USA","Hinez57"

1204,"2009-07-20",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2011 Bottle. Poured a rich dark brown almost black in color it had a nice light brown frothy head that was mostly lasting with excellent lacing. 

The aroma was moderate of roasted malts, a light resin hop and nice dose of doughy yeast with notes of molasses and coffee. 

It tasted mildly sweet with a hint of molasses in the beginning and finished slightly bitter-sweet with a rich coffee note at the end that left the flavor lingering around for a nice long while. 

Mouthfeel was surprisingly medium in body and very creamy in texture with a flat carbonation.

It poured a terrific dark and thick glassful, along with a surprisingly small head, what there was being thin and tan.  Aroma was rife and rich with malts and spices, and it tasted just that, too.

1204,"2009-07-09",3.9,"Original review date 2/9/2008...

Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours like a Diet Coke - dark and carbontated with frothy pale head that dissipates quickly. Looks like powerful syrupy stiff.

German chocolate aroma - a little soft, a sour, sorta metal. After about 15 minutes it reveals a toasted nut texture - almost like pecan pie. Strong, smoked malt taste - a little too puckering at first but develops slowly. Still slightly sour. Alcohol and malt are there in force - could be a little better blended but still well-balanced. Short-to-medium finish. Carbonation is long gone a few minutes after pour - first sip is a little clammy; a few minutes later its very soothing. This needs a little while to breathe, sort of like wine. Most likely best enjoyed in a dark, warm setting - bar, ski lodge, German brew haus, etc. - powerful, well-made stuff.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"
1204,"2009-07-08",4.9,"330mL bottle courtesy of matt7215 for my 600th rating! Thanks Matt! This gem pours a dark brownish amber with a small tan head. Perfect aroma of Munich, Caramalts, chrystal malts, toffee, bready-biscuity caramel, and awesomeness (which is a real smell you know). Flavour is just delicious, so complex, yet so drinkable. Sweet malty complexities upfront are balanced by a dry bite in the finish, subtle hop aspects and some smoke. Biscuity as I would expect, something I love about dark lagers. Mouth-feel is amazing, velvety smooth, it just slides right down and I have to restrain myself from drinking it all in a minute. Balance is perfect, it actually gets better with every sip. This is the ideal Dopplebock. I need an ornate fountain of this flowing 24/7 in my room. Let it warm a bit so it can really reveal itself to you!

It has some mahogany tints around the edges of the glass also. The aroma is a bit bland for my liking. It consists of subtle malts, some very faint cocoa, and a somewhat strange copper hint. The taste is what separates this bock from the rest though. It has a good taste of roasted and sweet malts and a slight hint of cocoa. It has a light mouth feel and leaves a nice bitter taste in your mouth after each drink. I will go on record here and say that this is the best doppelbock that I have had so far. I am still not a huge fan of the style though because its lack of complexity.","Streator, Illinois, USA","General66"

It doesnt stand out incredibly from other Dopplebocks, but it seems to have just about the right combination of everything. Smokiness, texture, coffee flavor, and carbonation. If I had to compare this to a beer, I would probably compare this to Old Rasputin. Though I prefer this, as Old Rasputin is a tad too sweet in my opinion.

Aroma of somewhat musty grains -- reminds me of visiting the ""feed and seed"" stores as a child in rural Louisiana.  The aroma is earthy but tends toward sweet as well with hints of toffee and nuts.  Flavor is rich and slightly sweet with roasted and bready malts along with some more subtle hints of chocolate and ripe dark fruit.  Well balanced, though the hop notes are subtle at best.

Something like candy seafoam - delicious. This is extremely malt-heavy.  The flavor follows suit, but its really got a surprising balance to it, all things considered. Very rich, like candy in a glass, but with enough subtle hops and roastiness to clean it up and leave a nice finish.

This stuff is dark, dark brown almost black with a half inch of brown head that is made up of very large bubbles. The smell is very bitter with coffee, wood and old fat woman sweat (you know that sweet salty stink that reminds you of grandma) being what I notice most, there is also a slightly smoky smell as well. I like the way this stuff smells buts it s kinda of weird. Good mouth feel, thick, not oily, and good carbonation through every sip. The taste is very nice it reminds me of a weaker version of a porter. Coffee, and deep roasted malts, and raisins are what I notice most, and they all have a slight smoky taste to them. There was also a very noticeable hop presence what was very nice surprise and the greatest thing about this beer is the little goat that hangs around the bottle neck that they give with each one.

1204,"2009-04-19",3.5,"2006 bottle. Had this back then, but never put in a rating; these bottles have been sitting around in the basement since. Dark brown, light-medium tan head. Very malty aroma - nuts, cherry pie and crust. Lightly oxidized? A little scary. Core of nutty bitterness, water. Just barely there fruitiness that I dont remember showing 3 years ago. In a nutshell, very old world beer, evokes some of the belgian Trappists. You can almost taste the history and tradition in this beer. A lot of quality here, though I should say I enjoyed it more when first starting into craft beer. Id like to try this side by side with a fresh bottle at some point. Now the flavor compares with Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru, Slaapmutske Christmas, Winterkoninkske, etc., if memory doesnt fail me.

Texture is very light with a burnt coffee component and a dark chocolate finish. The flavors seem balanced, but they arent my favorite. There is also a stale feel to it that bugs me. This is my first Dopplebock - maybe I should avoid the style.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","barleywine1"
1204,"2009-04-04",4.1,"Poured from a 33cl bottle from Redmonds in Dublin. 

Very dark brown appearance with some ruby hints here and there-very little lacing and head. 

Smell is mixture of brown sugar, malts, chocolate and spicey bread. Its a nice mix. 

Tastes like it smells-a nice mix of flavors that is complex and changes throughout each sip. Overall it is well balanced in its mix of tastes I think and not too overwhelming. 

Very smooth for the amount of taste that is going on. 

I only bought one so that is where I stopped, but Id consider having more than one of these in a session even with the 6.7% ABV. Ill definitely try to get my hands on one of these again and recommend it to others.","Dublin, IRELAND","jspruit"

1204,"2008-12-15",4.6,"Pours cola brown with a 2 fingercreamy mocha head that has good retention. Aroma has a lot of malt, yeah, lots of malt. Toast, roast, dried, fruit, burnt sugar, caramel, cane juice, and maybe a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is once again huge on rich, yummy malt. Plenty of grain, and caramel, leading to roast, molasses, a hint of toast, lots of sweet pitted fruit, some coffee and nice burnt toffee. Hop notes are minimal but very well done, mostly of the herbal and floral notes, a little grass, and they provide just enough spice to balance the intesnse malt out to be delicious, definitely a good beer to serve cool and let warma bit to let the flavor mature. Body is thick but not too sticky and sweet but not cloying. This is the absolutely perfect beer for this cold winter evening. Absolutely a great beer all around.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

So tonight Beershine texts to say shes going to open one in honor of my sisters 24-hour natural childbirth and the new baby, Nathaniel Ezra Cote, whose father-in-law Pierrre, is a beerlover himself. I had to come over and pop open one (see picture) on my nephews real first birthday. And it was as tasty and festive as I had remembered!","USA","MarsontheMoon"

1204,"2008-05-12",4.1,"I knew this was going to be something special when the bottle came to the table.  Its aroma is powerful, malts, alchohol, and perhaps some rye.  Its appearance is great w/ a dark brown body, with reddish carbonated head.  Its flavor is masterful, w/ liquour, malt, perhaps chocolate, and coffee.  Its smooth.  Its a bit filling, but not to stuffing.  Its a great brew.  Deserving of its place.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

First Impression: A nice ruby drinkable beer. Aroma smells just like a nice lager, but taste is much different. Lots of grain and herbs in the aroma. Visuals are all about the ruby -- deep dark ruby body with explosively carbonated head to start, but dies down very quickly. Tastes much like a brown ale, but has nice raisin, licorice, and nut signatures. Palate is dark, and activates the entire mouth. Subtle and layered. Second Impression: This reminds very much of what a great grain inspired beer might achieve. Im not that familiar with the style, and so I cant speak unto its accuracy, but it is a very nicely done beer. Personally, I prefer a stronger style than this, like an imperial stout, double IPA, or a barleywine style ale, but as it is, its very good.

1204,"2008-05-10",4.4,"Pours dark mahogany with a foamy tan head that will do the deed to the bottom, leaving lovely lace in the glass. A knockout of an aroma: candied figs and prunes, toffee, pumpernickel bread, white grapes and earth. First sip gave flavor of dark chocolate covered espresso beans. Everything after that was all over the place! Dark belgian chocolate, Antiguan coffee, caramel, molasses and butterscotch ala Werthers original. This is the crazy part: my grandma has always had these little strawberry hard candies at Christmas that have strawberry goo in the center. They are wrapped in a cellophane and foil wrapper that looks like a strawberry on the outside. If you were to cook these candies in a pot on the stove and ever so slightly burn the syrup, the resulting flavor and aroma would be what I picked up in this beer. Whew! Every time I take a drink I enjoy the FINISH more than the initial flavors. This finish is second in length only to, from what I have experienced, the North Coast Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout, but the first place trophy overall goes to the Celebrator. The finish is long and dirty with loads of flavor and not too chalky or bitter like one would expect. The next time I am in good company after a large meal i.e. Thanksgiving, I will make sure I have enough Celebrator on hand for everyone to raise a glass.","Tampa, Florida, USA","MacAnUltaigh"

So, for me, this is a re-rate. Pours a dark chocolate brown with a large brown head. Brown sugary wheaty aroma. Kind of off-putting. Nice malty taste. It has a ""off"" aroma and taste to me, but its minor (maybe it was bigger with my last bottle), so this is still enjoyable.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
1204,"2008-03-19",4.0,"12 oz bottle.  Pours clear cola, with a creamy light tan head that dissipates to a ring around the glass.  No lacing.  Strong aroma is fruity and malty, with figs and molasses most prominent, along with some toast and a touch of chocolate.  Flavor is rich and malty (duh); rather sweet but nicely balanced toward and through the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium to medium-full and slick, with low (a bit too low) carbonation.  Smooth and a bit warming.  The short head and low carbonation makes me think I may have sampled a slightly off bottle. Still an excellent beer and certainly the best doppelbock Ive had.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","surffisher"

Long roasted flavours and smooth malt notes with a light hop bitterness in the finish. very good.","london, Greater London, ENGLAND","renffisch"
1204,"2008-03-18",3.7,"Bottle. Celebrator pours a clear dark ruby body and a small, beige head. The aroma surprises me a bit, as it feels quite weak. Theres a roasted, slightly smoked start, followed by dark berries and a sweet maltyness. As it warms up, theres also a slight vegetal touch, cooked cabbage I think, some alcohol and a more pronounced fruityness. In the far back, theres some cocoa and coffee. Sure a complex beer, but I still expected more. Maybe Im not being nice now, its sure a good aroma, but I prefer Aventinus. Another style, but not that different, and its sweeter. Maybe its just my sweet tooth talking. The flavor brings out the berries more evident, and dried fruits also does a proper job. Theres also the dry, roasted flavors from the aroma, as well as sweetness and a little bitterness, but the vegetables from the aroma is fortunately not tasteable. Quite sticky, full and quite warming in the mouth. It finishes with a long, roasted flavor, and shorter flavors of dried fruits, malty sugar and some hoppy bitterness. To sum it up, its a lovely beer, maybe deserving a higher rating, I would be happy to lift my rating for aroma and flavor by .5 point, but thats not possible, so 3.7 it is. I have more bottles, so a rerate might be appropriate. (080318)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

A doppelbock done right is really delicious, and a not so good one is supremely unbearable (see my review of Paulaner Salvator).  This poured pitch black (which surprised me when I looked at the picture of it shown on ratebeer, where it looks much lighter).  It has a small, kind of strange tan/ weird off white head (I can;t really figure out what color it is, and it seems light for the darkness of the beer).  The aroma is pungent, with traces of dark fruit, sweet malt, alcohol, molasses, coffee, and tobacco (reminded me of a sweeter stout).  The flavor was not harsh, almost light, yet still very rich in flavor.  This beer tasted how a dopplebock should taste, and was not unbearable sweet like some.  The alcohol is mostly hidden underneath flavors of oak, sweet raisins and or prunes, and oats.  It felt rich and smooth on my palate; it had a medium body with a heavy taste and light carbonation.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

Cant believe its taken me this long to try this one. Dark chocolate brown body with gorgeous ruby red highlights once its held up to a light source. 2 finger thick tan head doesnt have incredible retention, but it does leave a fairly thick ring of foam atop the beer, and there is some nice lacing present as well. Aromas of chocolate, caramel malts, dark fruity esters, figs, raisins, floral/perfume hops and then a wave of roasty malts and beans. A touch of phenol alcohol heat at the very end doesnt detract much from the aroma, if at all. Fore is sweet dark fruits, chocolate, dark roasted malts, some hop bitterness and licorice. Back end ramps up the chocolate and dark fruit notes. This is delicious. Creamy palate, full bodied and very substantial feeling. Medium carbonation, this one is fun to drink.

The palate is a malt feast!  The malt just explodes in your mouth. There is just too much going on to put it into words.  Hops are here, but the subtle kind.  This is a fine, fine beer.

If you dont know what decoction mashing is or dont know what it does to a beer, this brew represents the epitome of decoction... great, sweet, melanoidin flavor, and geat dextrin body.  This beer is all about the malt and has just enough carbonation and hops to help wash it down so youre left reaching for another bottle.

Unbelievably, I have never rated this beer in all the years I have been drinking it (many a four pack has come and gone, with me saying ""whoops, forgot to rate it again"". I have also had this on tap at the Ayinger Speis und Trunk in Munich during  Starkbier St. Josephs Day and it was fabulous (and strong).

1204,"2007-12-29",3.7,"bottle.  pours a deep dark almost opaque mahogany, with a thiin tan head that doesnt feel the need to bore us with its presence.  taking a sniff, i get a spicy noble hop smell, with a lot of caramel and chocolate malt scents, backed up by raisins, plums, and other dark fruit.  the chocolate and caramel malt dominates the flavor, which still has a solid, but lessened, noble hop presence, and a smattering of tasty dark fruit esters, and that lager crispness.  as the taste fades, im left with a somewhat mild bitterness that dominates a light sweetness that seems to complement the malt flavors perfectly.  quite full-bodied for a lager, which leaves it somewhere between medium and full, with a somewhat oily mouthfeel and a reasonable amount of carbonation.  this is quite possibly the best lager beer ive ever had.  its really unparalleled in taste and complexity.  i generally dislike lagers, but id drink this every night if i could.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

1204,"2007-12-24",4.0,"Deep, clear brown with garnet highlights.  Chocolate, caramel, light coffee, light smoke, walnuts all permeate the aroma.  Fairly sweet, toasted with a light nutty tang--almost cola like at times.  Medium bodied, creamy texture with tight, lively carbonation.  Really clean, deep and interesting.  Shall definitely be revisted this holiday season!  50cl bottle.Earlier Rating: 7/23/2003 Total Score: 3.8Tall, creamy, tan head over a deep brown body with mahogany edges.  Aroma is thick with pure malt and biscuity sweetness with plenty of room for chunky brown sugar, svelte dark chocolate and an edge of oily, black coffee.  Sharp sulphur slashes through the aroma pleasantly and fits well with the slightly pungent figgy notes.  A floral, honeyed element rounds out the aroma.  The flavour has an elegant sweetness to it, like treacle, set against softly roasty coffee, a little chocolate, seguing into a plummy, figgy middle and finally into a long finish replete with toasted rye bread, toffee and first molasses.  Medium bodied with a big oily/creamy texture and full, delicate carbonation.  33cl bottle, bbe 08/2008.  A little bit of a downgrade from my earlier score of 4.5, but still a great beer worthy of praise.A much deserved revisit for a rich classic.  The pour reveals a deep, clear brown body contained by a medium-sized, frothy, very light tan head.  A powerful and rich aroma emanates from my glass, full of dark sweet scents like mämmi, dates, prunes and milk chocolate.  Behind that I find notes of toasted almonds.  Overall, the aroma is sweet, malty and grainy in a good way.  The flavour is quite sweet as expected, full of mämmi, dates and toffee.  As it warms a hint of sweetened café au lait can be detected.  The finish is lightly woody, lightly dry.  Soft carbonation makes room medium to full body with a luxurious, velvety texture.  A clean and classy classic all the way around, though slightly less enchanting than I thought previously.  Original score of 9,4,9,5,18=4.5.330 mL, tulip glass.  Average sized tan head is creamy/frothy.  Body is a deep garnet where light is able to pass through around the edges, otherwise its a brown/black.  Aroma is a soft bouquet of malt scents.  Lots of dark aromas prevail; caramel, molasses, coffee, chocolate.  Hops are perceptible in the aroma (barely) and smell of herbs.  Perhaps some dark fruits are present also.  The flavor starts off moderately sweet / lightly bitter and moves to a lightly sweet / moderately bitter finish.  Very little acidity present.  The mouthfeel is absolute perfection.  Full, rich, creamy body has wonderful soft carbonation and simply glides down to your stomach.  Absolutely beautiful beer!","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

1204,"2007-12-04",4.5,"Bottle into pilsener glass.  This is the one that started it all.  I should be saving this rating for a milestone, but Im impatient.  My appreciation for good beer began in the University of Chicago Pub under Ida Noyes Hall during my fourth year there, when Chris Quiroga handed me a bottle of this and told me to try it.  He had just recently discovered it, and wanted to share the experience; Im glad he did.  I remember that on that occasion in 2002, my only comment was that there were layers to the flavor, three distinct ones that I could not describe but could definitely taste.  Ill try to be more descriptive this time.  Pours with an oatmeal head that is creamy and filmy, over a dark but clear ruby brown beer.  Very musty bready smell, with a buttery sweetness and some fruity alcohol notes.  Luxuriously full, the malty sweetness coats the whole mouth; then, the flavor gives way to dark grains, prunes/raisins, and twiggy earthiness (still juicy, though, not dusty); the third layer gets almost bitter and dry, intensifying the earthy qualities in a mild roastiness and a cracker malt character over the top.  The first layer also belies the fruitiness, like malted grapes (if such a thing makes sense; Im thinking like malted milk, not malted barley), before it really takes center stage on the second level.  This is still a world-class beer, even after all these years, and will forever be a sentimental favorite.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Im not too familiar with the doppelbock style, so I didnt know what to expect. The aroma and taste were a bit subtler than what I wouldve guessed, not as chocolatey or roasted. Neither the alcohol nor the hops were all in-your-face. Anyways, the Celebrator was fantastic! and I got a cool little Christmas ornament on the bottle.","Missouri, USA","GlenVargas"

1204,"2007-08-31",4.0,"Bottle, with goat. I noticed that after all these years I hadnt rated this one, nor any of the Ayinger beers. Not an oversight on my part but pure laziness. We used to drink this one quite often at the Old Chicago in Tempe, Arizona. I could have built up a mountain of goats 6-7 years ago. In an effort to be true to my ratings Ive gone back and bought them again......a 4 pack of this one to be precise and Im on the second. It pours dark with a disapearing tan head. Aroma is quite rich, full of malt, espresso, brown sugar, dark chocolate, and light soy. Smooth and lightly carbonated on the tongue. Flavors are malty and grainy and lightly sweet, with some light chocolatey bitterness, maybe a hint of dark caramel, and good wholesome roastiness. Finish is fairly dry which compliments the sweet middle.

Beer had flavors of chocolate, barley-malt, with a dash of hops for some kick.  Overall pretty robust and complex but very drinkable.  Thats what I love about this style.

I picked up mostly chocolate malts with a bit of coffee and perhaps the faintest hint of smoke.  The flavor is a rich blend of bitter and sweet chocolate, with a smokey, hoppy, dry finish.  Medium body makes this an easy drinking beer.  Very nicely done.  Similar to a smooth chocolate porter.  Great beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Smooth alcohol in the finish. Medium to full palate, but still easy to drink. A superb drink. No wonder it has been saluted among the very best beers in Germany. I guess my score has been a bit influenced by the atmosphere when drinking this doppelbock; it was used as a dessert at the end of a delicious dinner in the biergarten of the Brauereigasthof in Aying on a dark, but warm late evening in June - under flaming moonshine.

1204,"2007-06-12",4.0,"THOUGHTS: A great doppel bock. Ive had several over the past couple months and this is probably the best. All malty goodness. Chocolate and coffee flavors and also some smokiness. A little less alcohol in the finish than I would prefer in a doppel, but still a great beer. I gave them a bonus point for the cool little goat ornament that comes around the bottles neck.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that looked black in the glass with re highlights with a average to large off-white head that mostly diminished but left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy milk chocolate and mild coffee, smoke, just a tad bit of alcohol and some dark fruit. The initial flavor was moderate sweetness, while the finish was heavy sweetness, light bitterness and sourness with a short to average finish. The body was medium to full and both dry and slightly syrupy with fizzy carbonation and a slightly chalky and lightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Celebrator poured a crystal clear scarlet red with mahogany highlights shining throughout into my pilsner glass. A 1+ finger tan head formed on thepour that ended up fading to a cap of frothiness. The body looks great. Leaves patchy lacing that slowly slides back into the body. 

Smell are deep of lightly roasted malts and fresh baked bread. Theres a brown sugar sweetness that comes through as well. A slight boozy quality reminds me of rum soaked raisins.

Flavor is much the same as the aroma. Starts with a solid dose of lightly roasted malts. Sweet banana bread hits mid-palate, seems doughy. Finishes with a touch of sweetness, mild nuttiness, the roasted grains, banana bread and mild alcohol fumes. Very nice.

Body has a somewhat chewy texture and nice medium, smooth body. Again, mild alcohol fumes show up occasionally.

Good cool weather hearty brew. Easy drinker and very enjoyable.

Celebrator is a truly well made doppelbock that deserves the praise it gets. I will continue to revisit this winter favorite often.

There was zero bitterness. The sweetness is the furthest thing from cloying, its amazing.

1204,"2007-03-28",4.1,"Ruddy reddish brown body, oily looking. Ample carbonation sustains a dense light brown head. Fair lacing. Aroma is rich with molasses, sweet malts that are moderately roasty, lightly smoky/nutty and very complex and alluring. Also noted are subtle fruit flavors that include plums and peaches. Stunning array of aromas, yet altogether too light and buried somewhat underneath alcohol and bready malt. Flavor rectifies that with ample roast and sweetness, more interplay and expression of fruit character and nuttiness. A benchmark for good malty taste for good reason. Finishes moderately dry and lingering with molasses and fruitiness, smoke in minute amounts. Carbonation is adequate and pleasing. Palate is velvety, medium bodied, lively and has a distinct resemblance to toffee candy. Very rich and satisfying, while remaining soft and secretive.

Flavors of light roasted malt, a bit of smoke, vinous fruits, and light chocolate elements all seem to peer through...all fairly restrained to where one is not overpowering the other...this balance of flavor much like Westy 8/12 or Pannepot or Rochefort 10 has that balance that really shows the care that went into the beer itself. This element is why I think they stay so highly rated...because really its not a common trait.

The aroma was excellent, an impressive mixture of chocolate, coffee, and some caramel malt, all with a roasty edge.  Their were also some grainy hops, and I noted a powerful apple scent as well.  The texture was good too, with a bubbly, full mouthfeel that had average carbonation.  It had a sweet taste with a bitter, fruity undertone and a dry finish.  I had tried it a few years ago, and had some trouble drinking it, but this time I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was a good benchmark to see how much my beer knowledge and appreciation has grown!

1204,"2007-03-02",3.7,"11.2 oz. bottle. Tart, lemony, dunkel-like aroma that is disappointing for its lack of strength and complexity. Pours a deep, dark brunette with an amber hue and a moderate amount of thick, tan head. Good, roasted, dark, German malt taste. Slight coffee-like bitterness. The flavors are subtle and improve upon multiple sips. Roasted coffee bean aftertaste. Medium body. Crisp, lively, drinkable, and refreshing in the palate. Ayinger Celebrator certainly is a good beer. It certainly is not even close to the best beer brewed in Germany, as it is rated by the users of this site. Heck, it isnt even close to the best beer brewed by Ayinger; Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel is a signficantly superior beer.

Has a ver large tan head that slowly descends into a 1/4 inch thick head that leaves ample lacing.  The aroma really struck me.  It is incredibly malty smelling, almost to the point of triggering an appatite in me.  This might sound really absured, but it almost has a hash (as in the food) smell.  Very different and very appealing.  Mouthfeel is slightly viscous, but not sticky at all.  Taste is excellent.  Dark fruits and maple nut upfront, with a maltyness that lighty wraps the whole flavor and lingers in what is a very gentle aftertaste.  This beer is complex, balanced, and not overpowering a all.

1204,"2006-12-21",4.4,"Aus der flasche @ Ayinger speis und trank, München, Germany. Served up in that lovely small dessert wine-style glass pictured. We had just left Hofbräu, it was late afternoon and it appeared we were the only people dining here. A shame as the food was as wonderful as the beer, and this monster here truly matches its 100 percentile.  Lasting, dense, inch thick pad of beige adorns it, amassing a wickedly artistic lacing as it recedes down the glass. Body a tawny chestnut, not exactly bright and quite dull without sparkle. Heady, spicy and thick nose of those sticky desserts my Nanna used to make me. Raisins, sultanas and prunes, layers of gooey caramel, hazelnuts, vanillin and cinnamon, and just a touch of  brandy. In the mouth it excites and enters every crevice all greedily invited by my taste-buds. Its body is medium, its silky, liqueurish, smooth and openly warming. Again the Melanoidins, those complex malt flavours that remind you of everything from crushed nuts, to savoury fruits, up the flavour chain to stollenkuchen and wood, this accomplished a mix that held me guessing and savouring at each slow sip. It peaks in back, woody, nutty and sweet with a big dose of peppery spices before trailing off to leave so much malt flavour lingering. Its perfectly balanced in whatever it did. A beer I knew I would enjoy and had to taste whilst in Bavaria. Moorish, ample, sweet, savoury, thick and just damn good. A lovely bock! (33cL, BBE 12/07)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

Aroma:... and then the treat begins.... very rich & melanoindin laden malt nose, deep caramel, raisins, figs and some chocolate
mouthfeel: medium body, the medium low carbonation makes it lighter, some creaminess and long lasting richness dominated by dry fruits and a background note of hop bitterness making the finish balanced and velvety 
taste: ""like the sweet center of a truffle"" a symphony of flavors with high notes of dark fruits complemented with complex dark malts from caramel to slightly smoky , dark bitter chocolate  to the ever present melanoidin and of course the perfect (slightly spicy) moderate hop bitterness keeps this malt symphony in balance.
overall: What an archetype should be... the complexity of malt flavors ranging from melanoidin (from a long boil???) to  chococlaty, & dark fruits (some nutty qualities more apparent as the beer warms up) take the center stage with the smooth moderate hop bitterness keeping this from being cloying... great lager ... incredible doppelbock... a must try .. especially on a rainy evening","USA","luvcasks"

And although it is brewed not too far away, I never was able to get my hands on this brew. Thanks to John (jbrus), who just had it in his cellar, I was finally able to get a good taste of the German #1 brew. Clear brown color, short brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, oatmeal, hop, some coffee. Bitter taste, very malty, roasted again. Very good brew. But during the years, I think it is passed by some great Scandinavian and American brews.

This is really good beer but from the ratings it has I expected much more - perhaps even something great.  Falls short in this respect.

1204,"2006-11-19",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2012 Back in the early days of Ratebeer, at which 5 ratings was still sufficient for a top 50 notation, this beer was the only European brew in the top 50 i just couldn´t find anywhere. While apparently widely available in Northern America, this one was impossible for me to find in Europe. Over the years i´ve been looking everywhere, including Bavaria, but the closest i got was an empty bottle in some bar in Sevilla, Spain. But finally, jbrus had obtained a bottle and was willing to share (big thanks John!). Naturally, it would be very difficult for this beer to live up to its reputation. And of course, it couldnt. Without going into detail i can say that it basically has all features a German Doppelbock requires,  but i can not say it has any exceptional qualities. A bit of a deception, but on the other side, it ends a 5 year quest. Re-rate: Bottled from Biernavigatie.nl. Besides the hype, i must say this is still quite nice. The coffee notes, in the aroma, roasted malts, not overly bitter. Nice bock. Overrated, but nice.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"

A large 3 inch head rose to the top of my clear glass mug making fizzing noises and settling into a creamy tan head.

Flavor is laden with smokey roast malt and slight underlying teasings of alcohol & light hops.   Finish is coffee, malt and lingering candied fruit.

1204,"2006-09-25",4.0,"I love this beer, and its hard to add to what others have already noted.  I could come up with a ornate explanation of the drinking experience but its documented clearly.  What I can add is this.  Celebrator was so good that it started my wifes love of beer.  All she drank before were fruity drinks with umbrellas and wine coolers.  What better endorsement is there than that.  Its rich, fragrant, and without any hanging aftertaste.  Its excellent from the bottle or from the tap.","Springfield, Missouri, USA","BudsnSuds"
1204,"2006-09-24",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2007 Poured a reddish dark amber with a tan head. A very smooth texture, and an interesting aroma with lots of caramel and malt.  It was an incredibly easy beer to drink and had a rich stout-like flavor with a subtle hop finish dominated mostly by caramel and roasty malt. Nice wheaty and yeasty flavors. Very ciomplex and interesting, while still being immediately enjoyable. Reminded me of a stout with some more hops.  Id buy again but its a little expensive, being $2.75 for a 12 oz bottle.","Fresno, California, USA","Wegro"

Nice.","Wonju, SOUTH KOREA","beedman"
1204,"2006-09-23",4.3,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with a big beige head that dissolves rapidly. Aroma almost reminds me of eggnog, although roasted malts are certainly present. Syrupy lacing yields to a delightful amount of varied flavors - huge amounts of malt,  toffe, nuts, coffee, even fruit - all ending in a nice roasted dry finish. The Celebrator is milky and thick throughout, perhaps the creamiest beer Ive ever had. But, what I like the most about this awesome brew  is how distinct each  tone remains. Nothing is muddled here; each note remains long enough to please, but not so long that it bores or bothers. Complexity and balance - the perfect combination for a nearly perfect beer. Fantastic.","USA","Bajahobo"
1204,"2006-09-23",4.0,"12-oz. Whats left to say about this beer after 1100+ ratings? Ill see whether I have any nuggets of wisdom to add. Huge moussy, almost fluffy tan head on top of a churning, swirling mahogany-colored mass of thick body and flailing bubbles--just a gorgeous pour. Big malty nose, acres of lace, thick notes of nut and caramel. Complex body thats mostly dark malts but bears up some flashes of herbal hop, nut, caramel, dark fruit, and, alas, some metallic sour on the finish. Amazing stuff, the finish notwithstanding.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1204,"2006-09-23",4.4,"Bottle.  Sultry, decadent aroma ... grape, red fruit, and massive loads of malt.  Vinous, sweet, molasses, prunes (and suprisingly strong!), earthy notes, brown sugar, and very light alcohol.  Very dark red  pour  (to dark brown) with an ephemeral light brown head.  Rich and seductive taste, vinous and surprisingly dry, light smoke and heavy roasted malt under the heavy fruitiness.  Surprisingly dry.  Caramel and dark chocolate also jump to the fore .. lots of flavor here.  An explosion of flavor, really, in all parts of the mouth and throat.  Toffee continues even through the aftertaste.  Full body, thick and chewy, dry earthy finish.  One of the most pleasant aftertastes around.  Slightly sticky lips, but theyre dry.  Much drier, earthier, chewier than the Andechser, as well as slighly hoppier...choice between the two would be based on whim.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

I think my tastebuds started singing the Hallelujah chorus when it first hit me. I feel as though it is thick on the mouth with a bubbling presence and has an almost roasted quality on the palate. It isnt an easy drinking beer, so I wouldnt be buying a sixer to enjoy in one night, but it is a brew I would constantly go back to because of its thick flavor and great style.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

1204,"2006-08-01",5.0,"This beer is my all time favorite and must be drunk fresh, which is hard to find in the US. I have only found one location in my area that pours draft and this makes a dramatic difference. I was also fortunate enough to drink a few at the Ayinger restaurant/bar in Munich. This experience had me liking this beer even more as the flavors were so much more distinguished and was one of the most enjoyable things I have done with clothes still on. 

If you have never drank this beer and have had other Doppelbocks that you did not like, give this one a try, just make sure the supplier has stored the beer correctly and goes through enough supply to keep the inventory as fresh as possible. This beer pours with a dark brown head, if fresh will leave lace on the glass. Stop and smell the aroma as this beer seems to change character after each whiff. Flavor also does the same as it will have a nutty flavor during one tip and on the next a chocolate flavor dominates. Very fun and enjoyable drink with many characters in one glass.","Sammamish, Washington, USA","KillerBeer"

1204,"2006-07-31",3.9,"33cL Bottle. Effusive pour of tawny clear coca-cola, with a rocky rambling head of peach skins and brandy syrup. In the nose, a pungent deep dusky reign of nutty tannins blending profusely with glowing raisins and currents in a bath of pure cream. Alcohol and grain dust dance in a warm spring breeze and the barn door slides gracefully opened. Aroma subdued, but deep and explicit. Flavor is a blasting wind of creamed grains in a stew of fig juice and warm apple pie. Fusels are a little hot on the tounge, but bring a pleasent and lightly hoppy varied and muddled fruit. Im surprised by the heavier than average levels of hay smacking hops that bring heavenly balance to the beer. Im also taken a back by the lighter bodied. I expected a dense abyss of malty weight, but instead it retains drinkability. Theres a plane of processed character, where it lacks roughness in the edges. The melon heavy background glows. Overall, well built and nicely drinkable, but not a Top 50 for me.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

1204,"2006-07-19",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2006 Reputation certainly preceded this beer.  Poured into my Duvel snifter, I found that this beer appeared much the same as Coca-Cola when poured into a glass.  It looked like there was a great deal of carbonation seen on the bottom of the glass. Aroma was of vanilla, coffe, and roasty malts.  Flavor was slightly roasty with caramel vanilla flavors coming through most prevelant.  My one critique of this beer is the body.  It simply seems too watery.  I am not a huge fan of oily dark beers, but I do prefer a brew that doesnt feel like soda in my mouth.

I think this is probably one of the best malt and hop balances in a beer Ive ever had. Goes down exceptionally smooth and is very drinkable. Cheeer! Cheers! Cheers!","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","jason"

There is a bit of a hop presence which helps to round out   the flavor.  A well balanced and flavorful brew.","Southington, Connecticut, USA","bobaidan"
1204,"2006-06-16",3.9,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a clear dark mahogany under a tight creamy two finger light brown head.  Nice lacing remained.  Thick syrupy malt aroma, very clean, with notes of tobacco, carmalized sugar, and caramel.  Flavor is all malt again, with a thick roasty malt up front.  Finish is lightly smoky with tobacco and light alcohol.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate fine carbonation.  Slightly syrupy and cloying on the finish.  A good Dopplebock for sure, but not a top 50 beer in the world.  Then again, thats not anything that hasnt been said a thousand times before.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Flavor is very roasted, bringing hints of fruit (mainly citrus), coffee, malt, and a tiny bit of chocolate.  Hits the palate very smoothly, all the way down, not much carbonation at all.

Smokey, tobacco touch on top of typical bready sweet malts nose. Again spike of smokiness in the taste, followed by a mellow, but rather dull sweetness. Not much going on. The end however wakes up with a little saltiness. Slick, oily MF, full bodied. This is interesting. One searches for its famous complexity without finding very much more than some vague hints.

1204,"2006-06-01",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2006 Man, this one was good from the huge head obtained on pouring til the last drop with a small and respectable head remaining. I cant wait for my next Munich business trip, so I can stop by Aying and get a fresh one. Excellent dark brown color with a sweet stout type aroma, even some yeast detectable? Flavor is outstanding, fairly sweet malty and figgy type taste which finishes with a touch of a burnt or coffee type taste. Alcohol was detectable for sure, but not overpowering. Has a nice hop balance, almost perfect for the sweetness and level of alcohol. The smooth and creamy mouthfeel was impressive. June 06 re-rate on draft at Half Moon: I dont have to bump the numbers, but I didnt detect any yeast or coffee flavors. Dark fruits are solid and there is some chocolate character in the malts of this one. Very smooth and the mouthfeel is full, and this finishes with a slight touch of bitter hops, even some grassy notes. The bread character is subdued under all of the dark fruit and chocolate melanoid action, but its there. A really fine production. Re-rate, Sept 06, horizontal vs. Andechser, Maximator, Liberator, Consecrator, Bajuvator, hands down the class of the style, by far the most complex, dark and light fruits both mixed in, chocolate, v. light coffee, great grass hops balance, just wonderful, not too sweet, despite the aroma. World class, the best of the style by a significant step vs. the other nice examples from this style.","","User37895"

Sweet strog aroma of malt and dark fruits....mostly grapes, plums and cheries. Flavor of choclate and dark fruit. At mid-glass, the alcohol became more evident, but blended in nicely with the other flavors.

Oh so creamy.  Aroma is mildy hoppy, moderately malty.  Notes of caramel and damp earth, vanilla.  Moderately sweet in the start with some nice malty notes of toffee and the faintest hardwood smoke.  Really reminded me of the taste of carmelized duck, maybe roasted over applewood.  Wow.  Lightly bitter in the middle, and a slightly sweet, long finish.  Profoundly silky, and an easy 5 on the palate.  You dont often experience this kind of silkiness outside of a good chocolate mousse...

1204,"2006-05-25",4.0,"This is a relatively dark and heavy beer.  Its finest quality is its deep, toasted molasses aroma.  Additionally, the mouthfeel is quite good.  Celebrator Doppelbock has a medium to full body, soft carbonation, and a relatively oily finish.  When I poured it, a significant head did not develop.  The crown was light brown and fizzy and vanished all but immediately.  The body of the beer is dark brown to black and has no sizeable particulate matter to speak of.  I admit that since my favorite beers are refreshing and slightly fruity ales, my rating of this Doppelbocks flavor may not do it justice, but I found it lightly sweet and acidic initially, with a long tart and mildly bitter finish.  Though this product is not in my top 10, I enjoyed the experience enough to have another.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","ehoyme"

Tan head that disolves to a nice film thick layer.  Both malts and hops in the smell that combine, maybe plums and caramel.

1204,"2006-03-21",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2008 Pours a deep brownish-garnet color with clarity and an fairly small, light tan, fluffy head with decent longevity and minimal lace.  Nose is of a litlle faint but nice; rich caramel malt, chocolate, dried apricots, and dates.  Palate is clean and lively with a round texture and a medium body.  Flavor is rich and robust with caramel and choclate flavors dominating with some toasted almonds, hints at coffee, and a slight smoke flavor. Hop bitterness is low and blends well with the smoke flavor.  Finishes dry and rather quickly, just inviting you to take another sip.  Very rich, somewhat complex, and no real alcohol  noticed.  A beer I could really drink often and one of the best in the style.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

This beer is just jam packed with malt aromas and flavors. Big aromas of sweet malt and toastiness marry with some peppery hints of alcoholic strength. The palate is a rock solid malt back bone. Flavors of sweet malt, toast, and nuts coat the tongue. The body is very round and clean. This beer seems a bit more hefty in the bottle, I was amazed how smooth this beer was on draught, you would not think you were drinking a beer with an abv of about 7-9%. Celebrator finishes with more sweet malt character up front, then ends with a gentle, warming burn. 

Really a fantastic double bock, really a great showcase of sweet malt flavors and aromas. This beer would work well with hearty German fare, it works well with the sweet and sour flavors of saurbraten. This would also make an excellent match for desert. I would pair this with a nice slice of German chocolate cake, or stollen.

Smells more like a cross of belgian and porter than a double bock.  Has the taste and mouthfeel of a doublebock however.  Full, roasty, with lots of fruit and malt, with a slight buttery hop.  Coffee, dark chocolate notes, raisins.  Fairly smooth but with a hint of fizz and bitterness.  Its slightly sweet also.  Nice finish, definitely smoky and dry.  After four or five sips, though, the finish starts to take over on my palate to the point where I cant taste the fruity, chocolate coffee notes, though :(.  At that point, it does start to feel somewhat thin and one-note.  I have to lick my palate off to taste how it tasted originally and it is better then.  Dont know why the aftertaste is so overpowering on mine, I like a lot of other strong beers and bocks and dont have this experience.  This puts it several notches below the best beers or even my favorite bocks, unfortunately -- wish I could enjoy it continually as much as the first sips.","Paleolithic, Pennsylvania, USA","xproudfoot"

1204,"2005-12-12",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2006 The doppelbock is a style I have yet to explore, indeed German lagers as a rule are far from being my juice of predilection. Starting with the highest rated of all could well have led to the precocious end of my investigation, but instead I found a renewed interest in the genre. The pour was nothing to get thrilled about, a somber black body glowing dark brown in the light, topped of a light caca doie tinted head that fizzed down to a creamy film. The nose however, was more pleasing to my senses. At first I noticed an overwhelming odor of Marseilles soap, but with time smooth chocolaty malts began to appear and the aroma developed to a decidedly more complex character. Peppery bananas, red wine, sweet cream, soy sauce and grapefruit came to mind, while the ambient fragrance of chocolate and coffee provided a darker base for these lighter scents to evolve upon. The flavor sang in unison with the nose but brought to the tongue a soothing milky texture with nearly perfect carbonation. I was unaware Germans were capable of such delicate offerings, but I must admit I am now entirely convinced.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

1204,"2005-12-02",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 The lager style comes with a certain prejudice.  Americans are familiar with lagers as those cans of cheap bitterness that a few mass breweries vomit onto the market.  As an American, I too was tainted by this overwhelming industrial presence from Coors and Bud that equated lager with a pale, watery liquid that tasted bothwell pale and watery.  The Celebrator single handedly disarmed my hostility to this Germanic variant on beer, and seeded a new interest in good lager styles (especially in the Bock family).  Gone is the sentiment weaved by the perfidious American beer industry.  Unlike the fierce and industrious Teutonic spirit, the Celebrator is a cool, smooth and relaxing beer.  Each sip relaxed my muscles until I was a goopy mess of organs.  Even its placid exterior brings a feeling of tranquility to the room; a moderately thick foam the color of dried mud crests a calmly dark beer.  Looking at a light through the Celebrator gives a drinker the feeling hes in pitch black basement in an old home where a few cracks of light from the first floor shoot down and make designs in piles of old possessions.  The scent is comparably immersing, flowing with chocolate, pork, steak sauce, cider, cranberries, grape juice, artichokes, and an odd geological sort of odor that makes me think of German stone quarries.  The Celebrator performs just as skillfully on the tongue as on the nose; bringing the steak sauce on bread flavor to bear.  Also present is a monotone and long, mellow and coffee flavor; like a basso profundo taste of dark bitter chocolate.  The Celebrator, true to its vaunted history, is the vanguard of high quality lagers, and should be dispensed to every American whose interpretation of lager is limited to what they can find in a can.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1204,"2005-11-29",4.2,"Rating #600
Pours a deep, burgundy/mahogany with a tan head that fades to a thick film. Gorgeous malt aromas enveloped me in chocolate, caramel and dark fruits with a dash of smoke and stale Bazooka bubblegum for good measure. Although tasty, the flavor did not strike me with the same grand impression. Coffee bitters and earthen notes with pruney middle-sweetness led to an alcoholic astringency and lingering bitters. Able-bodied with a whisky consistency. A fine beer, but a thicker body and additional sweetness would have been preferable (its possible I simply crave a Barleywine). Regardless, it was easy to get lost in the indulgent aroma, celebrate my 600th rating, and forget about all else.

1204,"2005-09-29",4.3,"bottle.  Pours deep ruby brown with a thick tan head.   Aroma is pleasantly hopy though no real hop flavour comes through.  Very sweet with a predominance of toasted barley.

1204,"2005-09-27",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2007 Poured dark brown with a thin-tan head. The smell was sweet like raisins and spice. The taste is similar to a dried prune smashed and jammed into the bottom of an ash-tray, which surprisingly tasted good!, The flavors developed more as the temperature of the beer warmed. A most complex beer. The perfect Bavarian Double Bock.","Madison, New Jersey, USA","Rballs01"

1204,"2005-09-23",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2007 Bottle. Pours nearly black with a decent tan head.  Sweetness in the aroma, similar to chocolate or some other candy.  Flavor is dominated by roasted malt.  Tastes like roasted chestnuts.  Also some fruity/sweet flavors from the malt.  Hints of cherry and banana.  Bitterness from the roastiness really kicks in in the finish.  Little to no hop character.  Obvious velvety mouthfeel.  A very interesting beer.  Reminds me more of an English ale than a German lager with its lush, nutty malts.  sted bitterness.  Tastes english.  Little to no hops.  Sweet and malty.  Thin but creamy/velvety mouthfeel.  Some cherry and banana notes.  Rerate:  7/19/07  Quite dry.  a good bit of roast.  actually getting some earthy hops.  looking for them, I can find the hints of banana and cherry, but probably wouldnt have picked them up if not for looking at my old notes.  A bit of rye bread.  mouthfeel is not creamy and velvety in this one.  a little prickly and thin.  Not thin to a fault, but just a typical clean lager feel.  Im really missing that palate I found last time.  Still a really tasty beer.  Not sure if my palate has changed or if this bottle is that different than the one I had way back when.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
1204,"2005-09-18",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2007 bottle. Pours a very, very dark brown which only lets a small light through on the edges. The head is dense, tan, and lasting. The aroma is wonderfully complex, a harmony of fruit notes, raisins, and slight alcohol. The flavor is also excellently complex. I picked up a dry fruit taste followed by some malty sweetness and a dry finish with just a hint of roastiness. This is an excellent beer suitable for drinking on any occassion.

[Nov 11, 2007]------- Pretty darn good beer. Id say this is the best dopplebock Ive ever had. The buttery sweetness that I associates with bocks is very, very faint in this one. Fruits and subtle spices make up the flavor. Good stuff.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

As the beer warmed up a bit in the glass and the head melted away I smelled a distinct soy sauce aroma.  Palate was very smooth and full bodied.  Flavor was incredibly complex with hints of cherry, raisin, molasses and a great roasted malt aftertaste.   I was very surprised this was a. German and b. a double bock.  It was unlike anything I have ever had, quite spectacular.  I will definitely pick up more of these in the future","Oldsmar, Florida, USA","kfarrnd"

1204,"2005-09-12",4.6,"Its like someone poured a Belgian ale and a dark bock beer together, with amazing results. Pours (cold) very dark brown, with an inch head that quickly subsides. Smells amazing, like a Belgian ale with all the fruitiness, but also with a distinct molasses aroma. Very smooth, not very heavy but decidedly full body, leaves a smoky, molasses aftertaste. Lots of carbonation lightens it up. If you can bear to drink it slow and let it warm up, it gets more complex, with more fruit and yeasty flavors appearing. I am thrilled I found this for just under $6/four pack at Delicatessen Meyer in Lincoln Square. I could have one of these every day, all year round. You can only drink imperial stouts so long before you want some relief....","Chicago, Illinois, USA","beernightscout"

1204,"2005-09-06",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2014 Fresh. Bottle, 9/6/05. Superb! Pours a beautiful dark red-brown with a small of elegant tan head. The aroma is molassas and chocolate; the taste is burnt caramel, coffee, chocolate, and dried fruit. Not at all overpowering; the hops are soft and understated; the mouthfeel is lovely, and the beer gets better and better by the sip. 8/5/9/4/17=4.3

Bottle 11/9/2013.
Dark pour, red highlights, appropriately sized head. Agar and copper on the aroma, chocolate and raisin and just a little smokiness in the flavor. Hops make themselves known late.  Very different from dark belgian ales, obviously, and not quite as interesting. I like this, but I cant see going much about 4.0. Ill adjust part way.  8/4/9/4/16=4.1

Bottle, tasted blind 12/6/14. #2 in a doppelbock blind tasting. Much drier than the Primator doppelbock that preceded it, this one brings a lot of roasted coffee to make for quite a tasty, drinkable beer. Blind I gave it a much harsher 7/3/7/4/15=3.6. Ill knock this down to 4.0 and consider myself generous.

One year old bottle 1/7/07. I sampled a 2005 bottle tonight - its smooth and glorious with a year-plus on it. What a beer!
Four year old bottle 4/2/11. I remember a definite agar element to this one, but damn its uncanny how much it smells just like Luria broth. Still pretty darn good at 5 years: very smooth, smoke coming forward, fruit and maybe the chocolate receding though its been so long since Ive had a fresh bottle that I cant swear to it. Some thinning an oxidation - not a beer for protracted aging particularly, but still it holds up decent.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

1204,"2005-09-05",5.0,"Salvator is more famous and a great beer, but Celebrator is a vastly superior dopplebock, easily the best bock beer in the world. Its velvety, chewy texture is unique from any of the hundreds of beers I have sampled - triple decoction mashing, no doubt.

It  is very dark in color, very black with just a faint ruby color, allowing very little light to pass through and a ruby tan thin head that stays. I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone with a taste for fine beer. I cant wait to get some more, the best dopplebock by far, very silky smooth from start to finish. very light bodied.

The hops provide complexity and add floral, organic flavors.  Palate is even and balanced, with a dry finish and rather light mouthfeel.  A bit cloying, from the toffee charcter at the front end, however.  Still, from sweet to dry, this is an excellent and versatile dopplebock.  Glad I had it.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"

Nice, sweet, rich malty aroma, not much going on in the hops department (sorry hopheads).  Taste is initial sweet maltiness, with a little dark fruit in the background.

Okay, the mysterious element of this brew is experienced in the nose and taste.  Lets see.  Its some brilliant combination of dark toffee, strong nutmeg, spicy vanilla, hazelnut, jesus I dont know, but Ive never tasted its flavor  so pronounced in other doppelbocks. Extremely drinkable.

It is dark brown in color and has a smooth and thick body.  A sticky lacing was observed.  I also detected a slight metallic aftertaste as well (at first annoying, but later not noticed as much).  I thought it would be appropriate in trying my first doppelbock to whip out my Bavarian stein that I have had for about 5 years (souvenir gift from mom in law), but never used.

The nose held rich interwoven notes of sweet bread, fig, raisin, and roasted chocolate malt, with additional tones of toffee brittle and molasses.  Ultra smooth dark sweet malt flavors lead right off the bat, but quickly get accompanied by light smokey tones and German hop flair.  Just perfect balance.  Medium bodied, medium carbonation, bittersweet malty finish.  At 4.17 or so, it still may be underrated in my book.

The nose is all over the place, not very powerful at first, but really works well as you continue.

Collins, CO, to celebrate my birthday, and to compare with each other. Appropriately, Im starting the celebration with Celebrator!
Opened the bottle at approximately 45 degrees F. Perhaps a bit too warm?
Pours a lovely dark, almost opaque mahogany red-brown with a smooth tan two-finger head, that turns bumpy and thick and quickly diminishes to a small ring. Minimal lacing.
First smell is of raisins, coffee, chocolate and some sugar: warm and inviting. A very rich aroma.
First taste is rich, dark malt, and very very smoooth.  By mid-glass, some of the spicey underflavors have come up. The taste takes on a clove almost peppery set. Long chocolatey, peppery, clovey aftertaste. Mmmm. Im sure there are some hops in there somewhere, but theyre well in the background -- just where I like them.
So silky in the mouth -- you want to roll it around a bit.

Very dark brown pour, with a decent sized tan head.  One of the best aromas Ive had the pleasure of experiencing, just a huge combo of various malts that produce a gorgeous sweet scent.  The mouthfeel was actually thinner than I expected with a nice refreshing crispness to it, which balanced off the many chocolate, caramel, and roasted flavours, along with a decent amount of bitterness.  I found it finished very dry. This was a wonderful experience; I wonder if you can do any better in this style.

Re-rate - Ill knock it down a few notches from its original 4.4 lofty perch, as I had a much bigger sample shared with Hogtown Harry, GregClow, and Blankboy, and a fresher bottle (courtesy of Harry) and it didnt do as much for me.

Aroma is very sweet molasses, deep dark chocolate, some coffee and a hint of licorice.  It tastes just like it smells delicious.  Opens with plums and rasins blending quickly to sweet smoky chocolate almost decadent in your mouth.  Smooth and creamy with fruit flavors appearing from nowhere with a nice bitter finish.  On the palate it is oh so smooth with a little carbonation and bitter on the back side.  Very refreshing.  A truly delightful brew.

The taste is also chocolatey, but not too sweet, with some nice roasted flavors as well. A very malty beer overall, in the best possible way. Buy it. Drink it. Love it.

There are other good doppelbocks, but nothing compares to this one.  Body is a deep chestnut with glints of ruby; clear.  The head is packed with mostly very small bubbles; it thins out considerably as it warms, but what remains floats on top all the way down.  The malts in this just come rolling out of the glass; how do they pack so much in...?  This is so rich that the flavors and mouthfeel have more in common with an imperial stout than with your run-of-the-mill doppelbock.  Yum.   Loads of fruit (plums and raisins), syrup and nuts in the nose.  And yet, its sweetness doesnt overpower.

1204,"2005-03-05",4.9,"Now that it is finally bock season I can sample the brew that I have most anticipated for a long while, and it does not disappoint!  A malt lovers dream (yes, thats me) this doppel pours a dark brown with an enormous head, which recedes momentarily and permits filling the glass the rest of the way.  Held up to the light, the beer changes from a nearly opaque brown to a beautifully ruddy black cherry.  The aroma is thick with malt and dark fruit, as is the flavor.  Malty sweetness up front, with more dark fruit in the middle, and a little hoppy bite at the finish.  A thick, chewy palate rounds out what may be the best beer on the planet, at least for my personal (and admittedly malt-biased) tastes.  The only drawback is that its $11 for a 4-pack.  I suppose its a good thing this isnt available here year round, or Id be absolutely broke (and probably weigh 40 pounds more).  Prosit!","Le Mars, Iowa, USA","bbrock81"

I am not a huge fan of the Doppelbock style and have learned from experience that I hate the bottled version of this beer. It is far too vegetal for my liking. But I recently had an opportunity to try the draft. So with ratebook in hand I delved into a glass of draft. The beer poured a black color with a large fluffy brown head. The aroma was faint but had some pleasant sour malt elements. The flavor was heavy and malty with a bit of molasses. The finish is sour malt.

Dark brown, nice head, an attractive beer.  Aroma smelled like a freshly opened can of malt extract before dumping it in the brew pot.  Flavor matches.  Sweet, a bit smokey, but really just tastes like homebrew wert.  Maybe that is why it is so popular.  Maybe thats why I still dont like this beer.  RERATE:  10/14/07 as part of BJCP training session.  No change in score or notes at all, I still just dont like this beer.

I love bock beers and this is certainly one of the best I have ever had. RERATE 6/6/05. Lets see if this retains its lofty score. 11.2oz bottle. Tasted at ~45° in my NB worthy glass. The beer pours dark reddish brown with a medium-small, quickly fading head. The aroma is a monster! Huge caramelly maly, milk chocolate, some lactic sourness, maybe a bit nutty? The beer is very full. The taste is caramel, dark fruits, toffee, chocolate, smoke?, and a slight, fleeting bitterness that offsets the huge malt character. Never once is this beer cloying, in fact it is really not that sweet,  just full of flavor. The commercial description is right on with the finish; ""faintly smoky dryness"" is about right on. How in the hell do you get these flavors in a lager? In looking at my previous scores, I might drop the palate to a 4, but then I might bump the flavor up to a 9, which would make it a 4.7 anyway. No change in the score. This is by far the best lager I have ever had, bar none.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

I have anticipated savoring a Celebrator for some time. This bottled version is pasteurized I suspect but it still does not detract from this beers reputation. The pour revealed a deep mahogany red highlighted lager with a 2 finger mocha colored meringue cap that reduces in its own sweet time to a lasting sticky lacesoft natural carbonation. Aroma: Wow what a bouquet of malt complexity. We have dried fruits, licorice, molasses, tangerines, roasted hazel nuts and a lovely musty, earthy over tone from the noble hops.all aromas in proportion and discernible without being over powering. Flavor: The start is all big roasted toasty malts with a dozen different malt/hop/yeast amalgams which form an elemental complexity that is a pleasant departure aided by the silken mouth feel and rounded ripened character a veritable orgasm for the taste buds. This bock has a rich bearing without being heavy or sweet...fantastic balance and attenuation for a doppelbock.finish is slightly dry with the roasty-bready-cocoa tastes receding and the hops creating a lasting impression of  bitter licoricethen a nice warming.infinitely the best drinkable doppel bock in the worldLike a glass of liquid date-nut-chocolate Bundt cake without the sweetness.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

1204,"2004-07-24",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2004 last night i had a salvator for the first time, tonight i had my first celebrator! even though these two tastings were a day apart, my first thought was that they tasted very similar, but after a few sips of the celebrator i noticed it had a more roasted flavor but certainly not overdone!  like the salvator, hops are barely noticable but balance out the malts quite well. celebrator costs about .75 cents more per bottle than salvator. both of these are great beers but even if they were the same price, id have to give a slight preference towards the salvator. celebrator is indeed a great beer, but perhaps a bit overated.","Georgia, USA","kosh"

2004-07-XX. Nice ruby tinged brown body sports a light brown/beige head. Aroma is slightly roasted malt, which becomes more prominent as the glass goes on. Medium to full bodied it progresses pleasantly across the tongue.

The flavor is very subtle... not a lot jumps out at the beginning.  As it warms up, some roasted character comes through in the aroma and flavor, a bit of smoke, rich malts.

Incredibly sweet. And in this instance cloying is good because it lingers. Nice head that dissipates slowly. I think this one has a lovely saaz hop backgroud that really distinguishes it from other Doppels. The malt also has an interesting burnt rubber quality to its nose that subtly carries over to its palate.

Yes, its 6.7% alcohol by volume, but not once would I suspect that from the aroma or flavor.

As for its flavor, it has a bitter edge with a hoppy aftertaste, giving it an almost syrupy character, even though it's not viscid. Overall, it reminds me of an extraordinary microbrewed ale with satisfying carbonation, but its flavor just isn't impressive or unusual (to me) and, thus, doesn't seem commensurate with its rating.

1204,"2004-04-12",4.0,"Poured out of the 12 oz. bottle with a cool little goat pendant hanging on the neck into a 16 oz goblet.  Dark brown opaque dense body with ruby red highlights when held up against the light.  Nice two inch tall khaki colored head formed after pouring, but soon dissipated to a thin soapy ring of bubbles.  Lacing around the glass is relatively moderate.  Aroma was that of plums, raisins, and hazelnuts.  Taste was vinous and fruity with notes of sweet molasses, caramel, dark fruits, roasted nuts, and spices.  There were also some burnt smoky flavors evident.  Creamy mouthfeel is smooth like satin.  The aftertaste was dry and the only place where the hops stepped out.  Nice find at Ziggys in Chattanooga, Tennessee.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

1204,"2004-03-28",4.1,"I second the opinion that this is a great beer, but overrated. It shouldn't be a 100 rating - it's not perfect. It is however wonderful. It is a very fulfilling and satisfying beer with complex aromas and tastes in it of berries and various malts. I also found myself drinking it very slowly for I had but one. This would definitely be a fun beer to have lots of, if you could afford it, for celebrations and special occasions particularly. Very cool packaging with the little goat thing, too.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","DerBiermeister"

1204,"2004-03-26",4.2,"Bottled: Fantastic lasting light beige head on a deep mohogany body.  Smokey and malty, lightly roasty currant aromas.  Also lightly oxidized, but I won't hold it against this beer too much!  Toasty malt aroma becomes stronger as it warms and some currant fruitiness creeps into the mix, then becomes more raisiny/vinous as it warms further.  Very malty, but also very well balanced w/a malty sweet finish.  aftertaste is clean, roasty, and malty with just a hint of bitterness.  Body to me seems fuller side of medium, but not full as the description states, very low carbonation, smooth m/f, and warming alcohol presence.  Very nice and a hallmark of the style.

Almost opaque very bark ruby color with cappuchino head. Aroma has chocolate and roasted malts, this needs to be warmed up before you can smell anything.

Big tanned head. Very dark brown colour, almost black. Malty delicious aroma. Palate a little bit similar to dark Kozel. Not too strong but still enough tasty palate to make this very enjoyable beer.

I decided to only buy one so I had money to buy something else. Now that I realize what a heavenly nectar this is I'm feeling like a road trip.
Anyways, back to the rating: spectacular aroma and appearance. I didn't want to drink it for fear of not having it sitting there to smell and look at. Rich dark brown body with an absolutely delicious looking creamy tan head. Sweet and malty and slightly chocolately and slightly fruity - but earthy fruits - and perhaps some caramel and molasses. Flavour is more chocolately than I expected and reveals greater complexity as it lingers in your mouth. Truly wonderful.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
1204,"2004-03-20",4.3,"Huge light brown head of very fine bubbles.  Excellent aroma of roasted grains, sweet malts, molasses and a hint of raisins.  Color is a very dark reddish brown.  Flavor is good and complex with notes of coffee, roasted malts, chocolate and a touch of alcohol.  Creamy smooth in the mouth and leaves a thin film remaining.

1204,"2004-03-04",4.8,"First of all, this beer comes in one of my favorite bottles. I love the little ram tag that hangs from the neck. The bottle, the label, the pendant, they all say class. And class is exactly what you get when you pour a glass of this beer. From the big creamy brown head that lasts forever and leaves some sweet lacing to the perfectly carbonated cola colored body. This is an incredibly complex beer. The aroma is fruity, malty, bittersweet, smoky, satisfying and lively. Sometimes the aroma is crisp, fresh and yeasty; other times it is that of fresh raw wort. Flavors of malt, hops, lingering alcohol, and assorted fruits combine to create a magical taste experience. With each sip the flavor profile changes: sometimes you get roasted malt, sometimes full hop flavor, sometimes smoky alcohol kisses, always delicious. This is one of those beers that would be great to have on hand all the time and yet is better left for those special occasions where only a beer called Celebrator will do.

There is a slight aroma of roasted malt that is hard to get a whif of because of the almost over-powering smell of alcohol.  It fades quickly and lets through the malt aromas nicely.  Smoked malts, alcohol, and a nutty flavor round out the flavors.  It coats the mouth but not to the point of drowning out any other flavors.  Seems to have more than 6.7% ABV in the taste.  I like that.

Thick lace adheres well to glass. Aroma is like cookie dough and bread combined. Malty sweetness is the first thing I come up with upon drinking, and then this flavor rapidly grows to a warming, nutty mouthfeel. Drinkability was exceptional. I had four bottles and wanted more. Didn't have any left, so we went to the Ayinger Marzen, and it simply didn't match up, as good as it was. One of my all time favorites, and I don't see a lot of this style to compare to.

Beautiful dark brown with a large head that settled in short time leaving nice lacing around the glass.  Aroma was malty with a mild smokeyness and overtones of sweet dark fruits.  Flavor is rich, bold, and complex. Malt, prune, sweetness to start with the slightest bite of hops and smoke flavor on the finish. A little alchol is present and it blends in prefectly.

Now this has one terrific look about it it pours an opulent dark red, almost deep dark blood red..with a small off-white head that doesnt last too long.
Smell as expected with this style is super sweet and malty..so sweet its almost ""winey""..but its pleasant not sickening.
The taste is slightly strange it sort of comes in waves..first an almost zanyy sweetness hits , then it fades to a small bitterness, then some sweetnes returns and is finished of with a wet unsweetned chocolate bitterness..very odd...but exciting certainlly.
Very very nice on the taste buds due to the 'waves"" of flavour mention above!

It has a smokey flavor with a creamy mouthfeel. It is a nice black with a hint of red in color. It smells rich and has a sweetness that is noticible.

This doppelbock was a heavily malted, chocolately-laced affair.  From its deep chocolate-amber color to its hop-filled aroma, this beer was fizzy, filling and refreshing (a difficult combination.)  Hint of daisies.  Tinny, beefy and a hint of spice.  Complex but strangely not overwhelming.  The Yin and Yang of this beer was surely in good balance.

Taste: There is some prune flavor in there. A lot of malty sweetness with a little bit of a hop bite. Alcohol is present even though it is only 6.7

1204,"2003-10-27",4.4,"This beer is amazing on so many levels, I just don't know what to say about it.  Very dark with garnet highlights and big frothy head.  Sweet malty flavors swimming in there with many other notes, which I can't identify plenty of.  I can see the complexity and drinkability help it stand out as a beer of this caliber.  I feel extremely privelaged to have had a bottle of Germany's top beer.  I'll seek this one out again next time I'm in memphis.  Scrumptiliously marvelous.","Clinton, Mississippi, USA","stoutosaurus"
1204,"2003-10-20",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2005 In a Fin Du Monde tulip. Its very dark brown with a huge frothy tan head, slowly, but steadily diminishing though. Aroma grabs your nostrils and remind them what malt is all about, eminently complex and appealing with its chocolate (black and white, why not?), vanilla, cigar, and numerous fruits notes. Now thats malty. This beer is as complex as any other beer. Period. Rich roasty black chocolate, some caramel, lots of plum esters, blue grapes, cherries, pecans, coffee, yum yum, butter notes as well as robust earthiness every couple of sips (sometimes, the malt reminded me of Rogue Hazelnut Brown nectar). The palate is as good as it gets, thick, full, round, velvety. Long aftertaste once it warmed a bit that varies from a sip to the other, once it will be the dark chocolate, the other time it will be the roastiness and next time youll remember those juicy plums, subtly bitter at times. In my eyes, its fully worthy of these high ratings. Thats precisely the type of beers I adore, a big malty phenomenon with a body to back it up. Only critic Id adress it is the palate fatigue (or I just want the moment to last forever) I get after just one bottle, maybe the sweetness is too much although I never found it stickingly cloying, I wouldnt have two in a row, hell Id never deserve two i a row!

First of all the design of the bottle is great and the little necklace goat, i save them all.  No bitterness in the flavor at all.  Very very dark color and nice aroma.  Tastes a little like a Samiclaus if you took away all the alcohol and calmed the flavor to a normal level.  Everyone should try this beer.Time for a return rate. This was one of those ""in the beginning beers"" that will forever leave a lasting impression. Especially since I got the glass, really one of my favorites glasses. First of all, for presentation the bottle really takes the cake, a simple idea yet very well executed, not to mention the cool hanging goat. It pours a dark brown, dark enough for medium clarity but obviously a clear beer in there.  Its got a small but strong tan head.  Aroma is strong with a grainy-toasty-buckwheat thing.  Taste is bitter bark, light chocolate with more of that buckwheat. The whole beer is very toasty and earthy.  A low bitterness at the end.  A medium body thats so damn drinkable.  The light earthy sweetness is not sugary and the beer has lots of unique flavors, yet so damn German, just at the peak level of the style.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Just to try The worst, nastiest imitation Tar Ive ever put to my lips. So bad I didnt even take more then a few sips. I only took more then one sip just because I couldnt believe the crap I was tasting and the fact I paid 6 bucks for one bottle. Gave to my brother who long liked German beers. He didnt care for it....
I wouldnt let you give this to my dog....

I really enjoyed this beer.","Downingtown, Pennsylvania, USA","ConiseurofBeer"
1204,"2003-07-15",3.4,"Very thin head, but some bubbling to keep your interest on the deep, dark liquid. A bready, malty aroma. Bit this just doesn't live up to the fantastic image on the bottle. Luckily its flavor and aroma do not conjure up thoughts of horny goats rubbing my brew, it is in fact quite mild, a little licorice present. It is smooth, you could drink a lot of it and get really messed up quickly if you didn't watch yourself, but I do prefer bolder flavors in my Doppels.

The flavors are subtle and tend to come together very late... near the last sip. Strong cola elements have also interfered with my ability to completely fall in love with this beer.

Included are bread, molasses, coffee, and alcohol, oh and dont forget the roasted nuts.  Beer pours up beautiful creamy light brown head which is partially retained.  There is some light lacing.

Taste is a ton of nice tangy dark malts, a bit of caramel and toffee up front, middle twinge of chocolate and slight hops into the finish which is mostly dark fruits and toffee with incredible lingering qualities of twingy, fruity malty tanged dryness.

1204,"2003-06-25",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2005 Pours a dark mahogany color  with a mild tan head.  There is extremely mild lacing--barely noticeable.  Aroma is mildy banana--sort of like a Heifeweizen.  Taste is very mild with a hoppy/bitter aftertaste that hits you a few seconds after you swallow.  This is a very smooth beer, but the taste is rather mild and not very complex--maybe I was expecting way too much out of this beer?  Its really good, but Im not so sure if it deserves such high marks.  The palate is rather carbonated with a moderate heavy texture.  A very good beer, but I think it may be a tad overrrated.------ aroma is still about the same, but I do detect a bit more roastiness.  The appearance will be increased a point to 5/5 because this is gorgeous.  The flavor of this is very nice.  Slightly sweet to start turning very malty, caramelly, roasted, and slightly chocolatey.

Of note: a little expensive ($3.99 per bottle) to enjoy on a very frequent basis .","Virginia, USA","VAYankee"

Aromas mostly of roasted malts, with a citrus hop aroma to it as well. Looks almost like a stout. Tastes strongly of malts, with an alcohol bite to it as well. Very warming to the old gut. A complex beer if ever there was one. Slight hops middle to it. Coats the tongue & palate with a thick, chewy consistency. Almost a meal in itself. Goes very well with my special meatloaf & roasted potatoes.","","Cobra"

Taste of chocolate, coffee, malt, with a long lingering bitter finish.  Mouth feel not a big as a stout like Brooklyn Black or Storm King (of course!) but taste as complex.  Only drawback here, and most people may not consider it a drawback, is that the bitter hoppy finish lasts longer than other flavors.  Truly a great beer, and without a doubt my favorite of the German beers. // And again, this time draft at Brasserie Jo in Chicago ... maybe less hopped, maybe more chocolate, maybe less balanced than I remember.

1204,"2003-03-22",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2005 The taste of this beer was very understated, and very unexpected. Bottle. It was such a smooth beer for the body, though it did have a very strong aftertaste compliments of its abv i guess.  Not too much of a casual sipping beer, but would have gone better with some food.  This beer seemed like it was lacking, probably a bit old, and I imagine the difference of this on draught to bottle is large. must try it. 
Rerate.  Bottle again. Still couldnt get in to it.  It had a good balanced feel but it has a muted almost old hops taste.  The flavor is not bursting, there is nothing overly unique that I taste. Hmm, I guess Ill just have to try more.
On draught 2005 at Anam Cara.  I dont think its quite a fair rating, as this stuff must certainly be better in Aying.  But regardless, it was HEAVILY carbonated, had the texture and body of cola and though the flavors were even, it wasnt overly flavorful.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma came on strong and yeasty, evident imeadiately after opening.  Foamy pour to start out with but after 90 seconds head subsided.  Enough was left though to lace my glass throughout the 45 minutes I savored the doppelbock.   I'll agree with the commercial description of hops, alcohol and malts in harmony.

Awesome color, smells like toffee (and being American, from the land of the free and the home of where people never eat toffee, me picking up on a toffee smell is suprising and appreciated!).  Medium weight in the mouth. Caramel, coffee, toffee, bread, and malt.  Not a bitter swallow; pleasant aftertaste.  So smooth.  Alcohol is warming but not overpowering.

Hints of citrus in the aroma.  I would recommend Paulaner and Capital for a doppelbock and Lakefront for bock.  I even liked the Guatemala bock Goza(?) over this.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

Lively carbonation.  Has some spice to it.  Rerate 021304:  I haven't had this in a long time.  When I saw it for $1.69, I had to buy it.  My rating will not change.

1204,"2003-01-15",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2003 In my books, Ayinger""s Dopplebock is the one for which all others are ranked against.  Ayinger""s rendition which is routinely found in bottled with white tin wrapping and a plastic ram wrapped around the neck.

It pours exceptionally dark, giving off a great big carmel toned head which gives way to a strong collar and great lacing on the glass.  Its is quite oily, yet creamy and pleasing to the palette and despite usually a beer pegged for the spring, I find it makes for a suprinsingly good warming beer for these (El Nino influenced) winter months.

Hints of toffee, coffee and caramel come through in the aroma and are right there on the palette in drinking, as too are some spicey hints and a raisiny sort of texture.  A great brew worthy of a closer look by all beer enthusiasts.","British Columbia, CANADA","49degrees"

1204,"2002-12-25",4.4,"For my 100th rating i wanted something to really tickle my tastebuds and i definitely was not disappointed with ayingers celebrator dopplebock. The aroma permeates the nose with raisins, vanilla, roastiness, coffee, chocolate and numerous other small things come to mind. The Celebrator pours a beautiful dark dark brown with slight hints of dark ruby seen in the light...and it head was minimal at most, though mildly creamy for the first sip or two. The carbonation is the true key here and Ayinger has captured the magic of little bubbles tickling the tongue in just the right manner. The taste is of major roastiness...coffee and mocha are apparent, but definitely something fruity and lambic like...extremely complex and thats why im digging it so much as i drink and write this. It has a nice acidic, dry ending with those subtle hops doing their part leaving a sweet malty aftertone and an extremely happy palate. I must say that im very impressed here. Well... 100 down, 2475 more til i catch Oakes...away i go! The liver must be punished :-)

RERATE 12/25/02: It was time for the true test to put my top couple of beers head to head and get a true feeling of what is the king out there. Aside from my description last time, i found the flavor in this bottle to be highly lacking the usual kick found in this dopplebock.

1204,"2002-11-09",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2003 Bottle-If you get this stuff fresh, its probably the best malt-based beer out there! Super Sweet aroma-spice, banana, brown sugar, chocolate.  Deep brown with small carbonation, looks like a nirto pull.  Lots of malt in the flavor-chocolate, carmel and dark malts comprise a very complex profile.  Finish is somewhat dry with some coffee notes-very sweet!

1204,"2002-09-09",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2005 8/27/04: Aged upwards of two years and still quite enjoyable, though it has lost a little of its chocolate flavor.  Still very smooth and malty with lots of caramel and butterscotch.  This has thus far aged very well.

2/9/04:This has probably been aged about a year and a half.  Still pours a wonderful deep dark brown with a thick lacey tan head.  Shows signs of wanting to develop some sourness, but is still strong on sugary malt. Has very nice complexity, but thins a little in the finish.  Still the best doppelbock Ive had, although I think the aging has taken away some of its flare.

9/9/02:Unbelievably rich and complex with an aroma of freshly cracked chocolate malt.  Perfect amount of sweetness to counteract the generous amount of alcohol.  Thick cougar-colored head conceals the viscous body beneath.  Great balance of flavors: toffee, dark chocolate, perle hops, and roasted malt.  If it came in solid form, I would make cookies out of it.  Every sip is a celebration of the senses, and its the only beer I know that has an ornamental tassel.  The fact that it is so widely available and mass-produced, but yet so good, is a tribute to the advances in beer technology.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Great balance of hops and malt really... they kind of seesaw back and forth; finish was classic plum, raisin and quite bitter with a hint of sweetness...

1204,"2002-06-12",4.0,"Very dark beer. In fact if you just saw it sitting in the glass youd probably mistake it for a porter as light only gets through around the edges (when it does, it gives a nice red wine color). The head is a thick, lumpy foam thats a medium tan color. Unfortunately, mine seemed a bit skunky, but I could pick up some good malt aromas with the slightest hint of hops. The aroma was big, but not as big as the appearance would suggest. Caramel, bitterness from the dark-colored malts and some fruitiness I cant place my finger on. This was all followed up by a bit of grassy hops. I also picked up a little black pepper, but it was faint enough, Im not sure if I was just tasting things.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

After trying this beer on draught in a Celebrator glass at the Refectory here in Columbus, I realize I have found the perfect beer. My first perfect score. 5/29/02 (4.8) This beer is about as close to perfect as possible for me. Unbelievably easy to drink, with a light smooth malty flavor that was not too sweet.

Re-rate 10/24/06:
Pours a deep clear brown with a lasting beautiful lace. The aroma is biscuity malts, lots of caramelization, and a faintness of alcohol. The body is only med., and very highly carbonated making the beer seem far thinner. The flavors are super clean malt, chocolate nougat, and browned toast sprinkled with cinnamon. Unfortunately the beer is both pasteurized and overcarbonated. The overcarbonation is distracting but the pasteurization makes the beer far less complex than many of the finer US versions, including Sam Adams, a fine doppelbock.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

Aroma of warm chocolate sauce that in it of itself is filling (much in the same way as Storm King Imperial Stout). Sweet and vinuous on the tongue with no noticeable hop feel (probably due to the intense maltiness). Deep roasted chocolate flavor with a bevvy of prunes and dates as well.","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"

The titanic creamy and rocky head is the color of brown sugar, has decent lacing, and is fully lasting.  The nose is very well rounded and complex.  It also changes as the brew warms.  Toasted malt, flowers, herbs, resin, earth, raisins, cask wood, smoke, maple syrup, cola, spices and alcohol were the aromas that I could put my finger on.  The rich and balanced spicy flavor starts with flowery, alcoholic and fruity sweetness.  The long finish is moderately bitter.

The taste does not disappoint, as powerful as any lager can be, but whats really amazing is how smooth it goes down, how one can just toss off a glass as easily as a Bud (though it demands slow, contemplative savoring).  One of the worlds best; an ex-girlfriends favorite for many years, I just had my first one in some time and am glad that the good old days arent gone yet.

3/29/02  One of the few beers Ive re-sampled lately thats held up over the last year.  Might almost be TOO rich and smooth; its like drinking candy, not alcohol.  I just wish the brewers other fine products were more tasted and appreciated.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1204,"2002-03-29",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2006 Note 3/29/02: Just had this back-to-back with Westy 12.  My only question: why pay $10 a bottle for that when you can have this for $15 a 6-pack?  Splurging for top-notch status-beer is great -- in moderation.  Wooo!!

Note added 3/22/02: From past experience, you want to drink this beer relatively fresh!  After a few weeks, Ive had bottles turn stale and/or sour on me.  Otherwise, its a marvelous beer.

(Note: my favorite style is doppelbock.)  Re-rate, 1/26/02:  Ive always liked the <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/ShowBeer.asp?BeerID= Kloster Asam-Bock the best among doppelbocks and for whatever reason some recent bottles had soured me to this one.  But now, after a just re-trying this from fresher bottles, it quickly regained its status for me relative to the Asam-Bock.  Now it is sometimes hard to say which I would prefer.  But its no wonder this one remains so popular among the raters here; its close to pure enjoyment by all criteria.  One disadvantage relative to the Asam-Bock is the price of nearly $3 for a 11 oz. bottle, compared to just over $2 for a 16.9 oz. bottle of the Asam-Bock.  But this is just a superb beer.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

The aroma was rather complicated, I couldnt put my finger on it, but it had a fruity smell...the usual raisin and plum accompanied by hints of caramel and alcohol.  It went down nicely with a bit of an alcohol bite with more fruitiness.  This beer is very distinctive and it stands in a class of its own. This beer should be the benchmark for doppelbocks.  I like the little neck ornament too.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"

All good so far right? The intial taste was weird. I was impressed beyond repreive by the several blending flavors of molasses, caramel and maybe even some kind of smokeyness. However it was extremely potent and the almost over powering flavors got to me; as ashamed i am to say it made me cringe. So a week later i tried another, no cringe this time and it got better taste wise for me. This is not somehting i could drink on a regular basis, just not my type of beer. I admire it for its unbeleivable craftmanship and complexity and smoothe swallow and finnish. But taste as far as my taste buds enjoying it, im somewhat indifferent.

Next comes the smell: toffee, caramel, hints of sweetness that let you know youre in for a good beer.  The taste is wonderful - almost candylike.  Something of a buttery maltiness compliments the sweetness as it goes down smoothly.  You can feel it on the sides of your tongue for a while after drinking - it leaves you wanting more.  This is what Ill be drinking when Im not having a Belgian or a stout.  Easily the best lager of any kind Ive ever had, and it ranks right up there with my favorites from other categories.

Not at all roasty, but with some fruit/chocolate mingling with the warming aroma of alcohol.

I am glad that cat got killed. This is not like any of this style I have ever had. It is closer to a Belg. dbl. than one might think. A nice caremel roundness makes this beer and its malts jump.

1204,"2001-11-15",4.7,"Pours to a deep black color with the vaguest tints of reddish brown. Light signs of carbonation are barely detectable, while an impressive light brown foam forms. Head retention is pretty weak. The aroma is slightly oily, with a deep malt fruitiness suggesting prunes, raisins and sultanas, with burnt caramel and a strong alcohol presence. 
The medium to full bodied palate , is smooth, dense and thick leaving a little chewiness, while there are very light signs of carbonation. The palate is richly flavorful and complex, starting out with a predominant malt of caramel and a wonderful dark fruitiness pretty much as I described in the aroma and some almond nuttiness. This is countered turning to a very well balanced burnt toasty dryness mid palate and a noticeable hop bitterness towards the end. The long lingering, dry aftertaste shows a stronger hop character as well as a significant alcohol warmth, while the sweeter fruitiness slowly returns. The longer you sip this beer the sweeter it seems to get, although not overly so as one reviewer I highly respect suggested. I also get something of a winey character as the beer warms.

This is a great full flavored and hearty brew, perfect for a late winter night. A must try.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
