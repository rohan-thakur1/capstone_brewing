1062,"2017-05-28",3.3,"Can. At the beach. From what I can tell its kind of champagne colored. Nice gingery taste that cuts the sweetness. Not into ciders, but this is definitely the best that Ive had.","Richmond, Texas, USA","rougeau13"
1062,"2017-04-01",3.5,"Can. Darker than most perrys that Ive had. Big ginger nose and flavor, pretty good spice - balanced with dry pear instead of sweet apple. Nice change of pace.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1062,"2017-03-19",4.0,"Bottle from Bistro. Pours a slightly hazy gold with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Funky, fruity pear nose with light cinnamon and bretty notes. Clean and crisp with some faint yogurty action. Ginger heat on the finish and very dry. Really nice and dry perry, slightly complex, with the ginger integrating super well.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

Sparkling, hazy, light honey-colored body.

Smell is candied ginger & orange/lemon peel. Refreshing.

Harsh, soapy, spicy ginger. Lingering, coating, spice. Like chilis. Background is acidic, tannic, faintly tart apples. Cant get much more out of it.

Strong carbonation, slightly thick mouthfeel. Okay. Ginger is just way overpowering.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"

1062,"2016-10-18",3.0,"355ml can @ Alexs. Pours a hazy bright yellow colour. Nose is very ginger beer-esque. Flavour is almost all ginger while the pear is really taking a backseat here. I like it but I would like to see a better balance since it is supposed to be a perry.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"
1062,"2016-10-18",3.3,"Can - Spicy and ginger with some floral pear. Cloudy straw. Very effervescent, Apple and some heat from the ginger with a touch of burn.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"

1062,"2016-10-18",3.3,"Hazy and pale. No head. Nose has sweet pear, light yeastiness with a hint of ginger. Fizzy, the ginger is nice. The pear character isnt coming across well, though, a bit rotten? Well its a fermentation character that isnt uncommon for cider.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1062,"2016-10-18",3.2,"12 oz. can, pours a cloudy murky yellow with a tiny white head. Aroma brings out spicy ginger upfront, followed by pear skins, and a dusty dry earthy quality. Flavour is bone dry, with lots of spicy ginger and dry crisp pear skins upfront. Bone dry, spicy and spritzy on the finish. Not amazingly complex, but its well-constructed. Good stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1062,"2016-10-09",3.3,"First, theres not a lot of pear in either the aroma or flavor, but the ginger smells fresh on the nose and burns, but not excessively in the flavor. I dig this.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1062,"2016-10-09",3.2,"Can. Hazy bright yellow color, fizzy. Fruit aroma is first, with an edge of ginger. Ginger is more evident in the flavor, and it overwhelms the fruit a bit. Carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bit harsh and further interferes with the flavor. Tasty overall, but Id prefer it to be still.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1062,"2016-10-07",2.9,"12 oz can

1062,"2016-09-10",3.5,"Bottle at Mullers. Huge ginger nose, a bit overwhelming. Maybe there is some pear in there too, not sure. Cloudy orange-gold, almost flat.

1062,"2016-08-09",3.6,"Interesting brew reminds of an old school tonic medicine like the kind they peddled in original Petes Dragon. Fine pear juice pour with sparkly quality. Nose is big gingery bite, some other spice, and fruit. Tastes of pears, apple skin, sharp pepper, and ginger. Had a big dinner amd can say this is nice digestive. Pleasant","New York, USA","Jow"
1062,"2016-07-30",3.4,"bottle. Golden with one finger head. Very tart for a perry. Moderate ginger obscures the underlying pear to the point where I could easily believe this is a cider. Finishes extremely dry.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"

1062,"2016-05-23",3.5,"Sampled at the W&C Beer Fest 2016. It poured a hazy golden color with no head. The aroma was of ginger and pears. The taste was similar to the aroma with more ginger, pears and some tartness. Nice dry finish, very tasty.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
1062,"2016-05-09",3.7,"Pours light golden with a white head that leaves in an instant. The aroma has lots of fresh lively ginger, mild sweetness and a touch of herbal rusticness. It has a crisp body with mild sharp carbonation. The taste starts heavy on ginger, but also has some sourness, granny Smith apples and just a touch of pear. The finish shows some minerals as well. Really nice cider. Just got Argus in the area and after the first two Ive tried Im very happy about that.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

1062,"2016-01-17",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a clear light almost neon yellow with some visible carbonation and a white head that starts and remains at the edges. Aroma does a nice job combining dry pear, spicy ginger and just a touch of sweetness. Flavor has more of a combination of dry and tart pear that is supported by a bit of a ginger bite.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1062,"2015-12-31",3.8,"Bottle from App Vintner - pours cloudy yellow, still. The ginger is the star here, which overwhelms the pears. I do get the funky barnyard on the nose and soft pear notes in the dry finish, I just wish the balance was a little better. That said, if you are a ginger fan, this is a nice one for you.","Virginia, USA","magsinva"
1062,"2015-12-31",3.4,"Bottle from Appalachian vintner. Pours yellow with a thin white head. Doesnt leave much lacing in the glass.

1062,"2015-10-16",3.4,"Late night writing research session.. Pulled this from the fridge.. Picked up at Brewers Haven Boise... Slightly hazed light straw... Ginger is the big player.

Good domestic pear ciders are so few, far and in between I dont dig adding something so aggressive as Ginger into the mix. The ginger blows out ALL of the intricacies associated with Pear ciders.

Great delivery device for ginger... And still a nice cider... But I NEVER understand why any orchard would destroy the subtle pear cider essence.

My personal preference would be, ""IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEARS TO MAKE A PERRY, THEN MAKE A GREAT VERSION FIRST.. QUIT ADDING RANDOM SHIT TO YOUR JUICE TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING.""","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"
1062,"2015-10-14",3.5,"Bottle, shared by myself, all within the confines of my dining room! 
Pours a decently hazy pale straw color with lots of various sized bubbles. 

The aroma is pretty much fermented ginger, which (as a ginger lover) is not something I go all in over. Lightly funky, lightly fruity, inviting enough, 

The flavor is very dry... the fermented ginger here is essentially minimally offensive and decently well employed, however it does come off as somewhat medicinal to me none the less. The pear flavor is mild, but provides a light fruitiness that works well. The level of tartness is reasonably high. Its lightly bitter, fairly spicy... certainly tasty. 

Good stuff, but fermented ginger may just never be the ""flavor for me""","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1062,"2015-10-09",3.5,"Bottle from Gralehaus. Aroma: Ginger is most apparent with a little moderately sweet pear juice in the background; I didnt find the ginger to be too spicy or intense (then again, Im kinda addicted to ginger). Appearance: Pale yellow body with lively carbonation; nothing with regards to head formation. Flavor: Matches the nose for the most part; ginger spice still is the main show, but a little pear sweetness comes in midway through; the finish is dry, but a little fruit tartness lingers thereafter. Palate: Light body, sticky texture, lively carbonation, lingering finish. Overall: While Im not usually big on spice-centered drinks, this really hit the spot. Gingers palate cleansing properties made this a very able companion to my lunch time burger.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"
1062,"2015-10-04",3.6,"Aroma is ginger/spicy and mild sweetness/pear. The flavor is ginger, pears, tropical fruit/fruit and a mix of mild sweetness and tartness in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1062,"2015-09-10",3.2,"Pale yellow, very fizzy. White head. Strong flavor of ginger. Its hot and spicy the ginger is very strong. The pear flavor is hard to pick out behind the ginger. Its almost medicinal.the aroma can burn the eyes and nose. Be careful.

1062,"2015-03-28",4.2,"This is a tasty perry with a whoooole lot of ginger zing to it. Very apparent in the nose and taste with quite a spicy gingeriness to it that dominates the pear I think. I really love ginger so this was spicy, dry, lightly carbonated but just enough, and overall tasty, but be ready for loads of ginger. Nice stuff!","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"
1062,"2015-03-04",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a hazy gold with slight effervescence. A little sinus-stinging ginger, spicy and clean, then a bright burst of apple kicks things off on the nose. Flavor is bright and spicy -- more ginger and I like it -- followed by a dry, elegant apple with a hint of round fruity pear. Finish is long, spicy, and complex, though it never shades into outright heat. Wonderful.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
