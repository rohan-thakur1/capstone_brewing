Vierte en amarillo pálido y algo turbio. Gran formación de espuma de color blanco roto, de burbuja media, notable persistencia y buena adherencia.

En nariz es de intensidad media-alta, dando inmediatamente notas de plátano en su punto tremendamente agradables. Algunas notas florales muy de fondo, como de violeta. También algo de clavo y de pimienta blanca, ambos muy de fondo, así como algo de miel y un puntito cítrico. Complejidad media y buen equilibrio.

De entre los sabores básicos destaca sobre todo el dulce, aunque es muy contenido y nada empalagoso. Las notas de plátano que encontrábamos en nariz se refuerzan en boca. También aparece una muy muy ligera acidez y un aun casi más ligero amargor.

De peso medio en boca, se siente inmediatamente espumosa, con una sensación como de mousse. Bastante refrescante para una cerveza de este dulzor. La persistencia en boca es media, lo que en este caso es algo positivo para evitar resultar empalagosa. Aun así parece adquirir más cuerpo conforme evoluciona en boca y acaba pesando en la lengua.

AROMA: A light fruity taste of banana yeast esters, orange and some green pear. Minor bubblegum and clove scents in the background. Seems to have a subtle skunky scent, but it is not distracting. 8/12APPEARANCE: Burnished gold hue; body is hazy but clearer than most. Large bright white foam persists and laces well. 3/3FLAVOR: Light palette overall with a wheaty/bready base without any raw graininess or maillard products. Banana yeast esters emerge on the second half along with slight orangepeel. Clove-like phenols lurk in the background throughout to add a faint trace of spice. A light sour tang or tartness is briefly present right as it finishes but is not off-putting. No hop bitterness or flavor to speak of. 14/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Feels much lighter than 5.5% ABV as its a little watery in texture.

Glass: Weizen.
Appearance: Tall and pillowy white head sits on a hazy golden body.
Aroma: A bit of lemon, chalky malts, a dash of vanilla and a hint of phenols. Aroma is mild but pleasant.

Palate: Lacking some carbonation, chewy medium bodied.

1692,"2014-08-29",3.9,"Draft @ Kloster Andechs in Nov. 2011: Cloudy golden. Voluminous and persistent cap of tiny-bubbled meringue adorns the glass. Bright aroma of fresh baked spiced apples, plastic- and clove-like phenolics, banana cream pie, white raisin, tropical fruit, bubblegum, pineapple, and an abundance of floral Hallertau. Expressive carbonation is fluffy and creamy. Tad watery body. Delicate pineapple acids dovetail with a spicy-sweet dessert apple vibrancy. Pronounced airy phenol and clove notes cleanse the palate and pave the way for a creamy banana puree suppleness. Wheat is very polished, fluffy and starchy and harmonizes beautifully with the Hallertau-derived honeysuckle nectar. Quenching nectarine- and pear-like acids add tremendous lift to the beefy wheat and fluffy, yet perfectly understated, bubblegum center. Ongoing floral luster graces the exquisitely balanced finish which is awash with banana cream pie flavors and sassy clove spice. Plasticlike phenols emerge in each tasty belch. A tasty weissbier that showcases bright and clean fermentation byproducts along with elegant hoppiness and great malt character. During our visit to the Kloster, all three of the lagers (Jubiläumsbier Dunkel Naturtrüb, Doppelbock Dunkel, and the flagship Dunkel,) were curiously mediocre to poor (DMS in most of them), and this rock solid weissbier emerged as the clear winner.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

1692,"2014-05-17",3.6,"Bottle; Pour is cloudy medium gold with a frothy white head into this weiss glass - retention is average here , light lacing presence - The nose I find to be the highlight here - citrus, grassy undertones, that move to light banana, spicey notes are present - in fact, for the style - the nose i fantastic. The flavor profile lacks the depth that the nose presents, but its nice overall - it is yeasty , perhaps overly so - citrus and banana initial , but modest, moving to a bittering note that moves to spicey elements, light candied sugar , but the center is what lacks perhaps the nuance that I recall from weihenstephan.

Taste is reasonably good and slightly bitter or tarty which suits my taste buds. No special memorable flavours stay on the palate but equally it is not offensive.

The appearance is typical of the style. Straw yellow in color with a dense, white head. Fantastic aroma with banana, clove, spices, wheat. Refreshing flavor. Light and soft on the palate. Poundable. Superb balance. I would love to try this side by side with Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier, as these are without question the two best examples of a German hefeweizen I have ever had. Highly recommended.

Pours with a billowing pure white head that dies down pretty quickly and leaves a thin residual white head; deeply cloudy vibrant yellowy orange color. 

Getting loads of banana in the nose and it is quickly followed by sharper citrus aromas that are a touch sour; cloves and bubblegum-like flavors are definitely present as well.

Not quite the banana bomb as much as in the aroma, but still definitely the dominant flavor followed only by a pretty nice citrus burst and then has a more muted quality around the clove side of things, but its still there. Fluffy MF, yeasty, bubbly carbonation, really quite good over the palate.

Appearance: Pours orangy - yellow, a bit metalic shiny - hazy body colour with quite intensive carbonation, there are some cloudy strings of yeasts floating in the body texture. head is huge frothy to creamy with very deep structure of small creamy white grains. Head slowly decreases to medium and lasts than for a long time. Classic appearence of German Hefeweizen. There is also nice lacing.
Aroma: Wheat, yeasts, banana, clove, slightly mineral - salty due to mild carbonation, generally aroma is weak due to a thic head, a bit orangy, lemon peal, some build in barley malt at the background. No alcoholic nose. Well balanced and compound.
Flavour: Front is mild and chewy, medium bodied. There are some good retronasal aromas of wheat, yeast strains, very gentle saltyness on palate with lively carbonation beingsimultaneously gentle on the other  hand. There is exeptional slight hoppy bitterness on palate and clove - flowery nose. Very well balanced with slightly salty average to long finish, slightly alcoholic touch but in a positive way.

Light nuances of orange and grassy hops bounce around in between waves of wheat and baked banana peels. The flavor is ruled by grass, banana and hefty wheat. Bitterness is light,, acidity is light to mild, sweetness is medium to medium-high and never overwhelming. Mild balance, leaning towards sweet toast and complimented by a growing hop presence with each sip. Finishes grassy, lightly to moderately bitter and lively.

The peak of Summer, the sun now directly upon us and the little shade outside barely enough to shelter us from the heat, but who cares really.. We found the Andescher brewery tap!!! Second of many fine beers. Into a weissbier glass it presented well. Massive, layered, rocky white crown atop an opaque, pastel gold body tinged by a chestnut hue. Carbonation was typically high, erupting from eddying streams inside. Subtle ripe banana and fresh squeezed lemons on the nose, quite fresh. More zingy lemons and banana inside to be joined by some original grapefruit, apple and pear flavours to make for a very juicy palate indeed. Its light in body and the carbonation makes sure it bounces across the tongue but is not harsh or upsetting. Finish is crisp, a light band-aid note, definite cloves in there before it fades out to leave just a little banana and bubblegum. A sour edge becomes pronounced as it heats up, sweetness is well-controlled and it honestly tastes better more cool than chilled. A nicely balanced, intricately created hefe.

This was opened early on in the night.  I believe StewartOfGondor brought it

   nice way to kick off the night; thoroughly enjoyable and it would be quite
   simple to down litres of it at the monastery.  The Germans really know how to
   make good beer.
Aroma / Appearance - The nose is solid but not complex.  I was able to
   pick up hints of banana, honeycomb, white bread and a trace of limes.  The
   body was mostly clear with a golden tint and carbonation percalating to the
   top at a nice pace.
Flavor / Palate - The first sip was almost like drinking liquified
   Wonderbread.  Soon though it unfolds into a mashup of banana, vanilla ice
   cream and boston cream pie.  The finish is slightly dry with a light hoppy
   aftertaste.  This would be a great session beer for a warm summer day if you
   could actually get it locally.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
