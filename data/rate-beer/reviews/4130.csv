4130,"2017-06-19",4.2,"Bottle (250 ml), split with JulienHuxley. Thanks to hackobock for this one! Deep purple-red with no head but leaving nice legs. Aroma is complex and decadent with loads of berries and dark cherries as well as alcohol, caramel, honey sweetness and oak spiciness. Taste is sweet with gentle tartness, honey sweetness, loads of blackberries dark cherries, hints of caramel, boozy notes and light spiciness. Medium-full body. Still. Thick winey mouthfeel. Intensely fruity finish with fun alcohol warmth. A world-class berries forward mead that is dangerously easy to drink considering the abv. Too bad it comes in so small bottles.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

4130,"2017-04-01",2.9,"25 cL bottle. Looks like red wine. Smells of currants and cherries. A touch medicinal. Strong alcohol. Tastes of strong alcohol. Really strong. Sweet honey and cherry. Gooseberry finish reminds me of a gooseberry infused liquor. Heavy alcohol burn. It tastes ok, but it is downright unpleasant to drink.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

4130,"2017-03-21",4.8,"Bottle @ Schouskjelleren, Oslo. Pours a dark cherry red-hued purple-ish crystal clear body, looking mighty fine. Aroma is intense dark berries, sour berry notes, sweet honey, alcohol, dark caramelly tones and hints of tart red fruits. Taste is tart berry tones blending in with sweeter dark berries, honey, light syrup, caramel and hints of alcohol and faint citric tones. Full, heavy, sticky mouthfeel. This one has pretty much everything I ask for in a heavyweight sweet melomel. Delicious, and definitely the best from Sahtipaja so far. In fact, it¬ís the best melomel I¬íve had in general, hands down. Amazingly smooth and dangerously drinkable, despite its heavy sensory impact. So more-ish. Very impressive stuff.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

Ruby red.

Egen more berries in the flavour along with a very pleasant sweetness with some faint tart streak from the black currant.","Billdal, SWEDEN","larsniclas"
4130,"2016-12-30",4.4,"This took me by surprise. A bit more boozy in the aftertaste than the perfect batch #1, and tonight Blackberry Port still is my favorite even next to this juggernaut. 

Love how the berries blends with the honey and creates something that¬ís out of this world... almost. It¬ís only the boozy aftertaste that holds it back from perfection. Most likely this will dissappear with some age.","SWEDEN","milsem"
4130,"2016-12-27",4.4,"25 cl bottle (2016), sampled on December 27, 2016.Clear reddish brown color, oily rim on the glass, some very thick slow legs. Sweet, alcohol, tart, honey, berries, almonds scent. A wee bit too boozy nose, would be nice to sample again with some age. Sweet, raisin, honey, berries, caramel taste. Toffee, raisin, berries aftertaste. Warming alcohol. Smooth, full, velvet like mouthfeel, slight tart finish with a hint of an alcohol bite. A bit too sweet to be close to perfect for my taste, but really well balanced still. The mix of honey, sweetness, tartness, berries and the slight oxidation for raisins character really mixes well. Perhaps with a tad less alcohol and just a bit less sweet I would¬íve tweeked my numbers a bit more and higher at that. Though I¬íve had sweeter meads I¬íve enjoyed and rated higher, it is something with some meads that taste sweet that just aint really right for me. All that being said, I do enjoy this mead a lot and I hope the rating in text as well as the numbers reflect as much.","M√∂lndal, SWEDEN","gnoff"
