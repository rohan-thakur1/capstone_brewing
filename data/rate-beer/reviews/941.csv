941,"2017-05-15",2.9,"Light bodied light amber with a wispy head. Somewhat one dimensional, but well balanced. Spicy laid back hop bill did well against the earthy malts. Crisp pleasing clean finish.","Thomasville, North Carolina, USA","freekyp"
941,"2017-05-14",3.2,"Hazy gold pour with a frothy white head and heavy carbonation. Lightly sweet aroma with a definite grassy hop undertone. Floral and peppery hop bite at the start of the flavor. Somewhat malty. Good and very drinkable.","North Carolina, USA","HourGlass13"
941,"2016-08-01",3.2,"It pours close to amber. There are aromas of caramel, cherries, and grain. The flavors add a bit of corn with a smooth texture. It is an easy drinking beer.","Pinehurst, North Carolina, USA","hman43"
941,"2016-07-05",3.5,"Draft at the brewpub. Pours a clear golden amber color with a small white head. The aroma and flavor had caramel, sweet corn , light fruity notes, some pale malt, a splash of citrus, decent enough for what it is.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
941,"2016-05-20",4.1,"Taps clear copper with a fairly thick and fine buff head hat leaves good lacing. Aroma delivers strong raw malt, resiny hop and caramel notes. Flavor offers up everything the aroma promises, very satisfying and more ale-like than lager-like, crisp and satisfying. Firm body has plenty of fizz and a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Uncommon!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

941,"2016-01-21",3.4,"Nice amber-ish pour with a generous head. Super malty with caramel notes at the forefront. Something a bit off here- couldnt tell if corn added strange notes or was served in glassware that wasnt rinsed properly. Almost really good, but misses the mark. The infused version (cocoa nibs and hazelnut) was better.","","woodychevy"
941,"2016-01-18",3.0,"Pours a clear golden brown on tap with fluffy off-white head that dissipates slowly to leave moderate lace. Aroma and taste of sweet caramel malts, hints of fruitness, a bit of earth, and corny finish. Is the corn supposed to be there or is it an off flavor, Im not sure. Solid for the style, looking to try more from them.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
