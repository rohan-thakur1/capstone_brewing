995,"2017-03-01",3.5,"Pours hazy golden. No head. A funky bubblegumish aroma with some floral notes. Dry and nicely round. Low bitter finish. Great with food.","","grubypawel"
995,"2017-02-12",4.3,"Clear golden pour with a bubbly white foam that dissipates slowly. Aroma is a slam dunk of funk, great yeasty sourness and a lemony spicy sweetness from the hops. Palate is more of the same, great funky sour character, not lacking in sweetness and hop depth. Light flavours hit sweet, sour, spice notes in an order that is scintillating. Pure.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"
995,"2016-05-19",3.5,"Buckeyeboy hooked up this bottle at a recent mid-week bottleshare.. Thanks Jeremy... HUGE carbonation and head... hazy golden... Very dry fermented out Belgian pale malt is the big player with pear and white peach essence to tie things together... Finishes extremely dry and offers no apologies.. Crisp and bursting off the palate.. Also extremely burpy.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"
995,"2016-05-15",3.9,"375ml bottle side by side with the brett. Pours out a golden topped with a white head. nose is brett some floral hops and spice. Taste is more of the heavy brett floral hops.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
995,"2016-03-18",4.0,"Bottle from some online store I think. poured to snifter. Nose is a tropical and earthy aroma with light spiciness. hazy golden pour with a medium sized white head. Reminds me of a lot of the bretted saisons. Taste is peppery and fruity. Reminds me of a really good Belgian style pale ale. I was thinking it would be hoppy by the name, but not at all. Damn, this is really good. Super high carbonation makes it a little tough to drink, but otherwise, a great beer.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
995,"2016-03-06",4.1,"375 mL bottle poured. Exploding cork here, and tons of foam head. Aroma is bretty, citrus, floral, a little perfumey. Flavor is cool citrus fruit, dominant brett, and a smooth, cool finish. Delicious beer. Super unique, and such a wide array of flavor going on. Damn good.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
995,"2016-02-01",4.2,"375mL cork and cage. Craftycarl shared this at a tasting recently and I liked it so much I wanted to buy my own bottle. But couldnt easily find this around town, wasnt at any of the Total Wines. Eventually found a bottle at - maybe my fav store now - Super Deli Mart. Pours with a moderate sized head. Clear golden beer. Aroma is beautiful bretty, akin to Blvd Saison Brett. Its a cottony, funky, herbal-floral type of brettiness. Flavor has a lightly sweet malt but a mildly tingling carbonation cutting it a bit. Otherwise, a strong bretty character as well. The carbonation really helps with the slight sweetness and finishes short. Lots of yeast poop a the bottom of the bottle make the beer murky and dirty. This beer really reminds me of Blvd and the sweetness makes me think this can get even better over the year. I think Ill get a few more bottles and keep tasting it over time.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
995,"2016-01-29",3.3,"Bottle at Seattle tasting. Slight haze, golden-orange, small head. Mild citrus tartness, bubbly body, a little warm. Fizzy, not too tart nor sharp flavors of any kind. Nothing bad but it is flabby and not interesting. Meh.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
995,"2016-01-20",4.0,"This golden ale is not terribly sour but amply bretty - fruity dry funk. Its sweeter than expected and quite unique. Good on them.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
995,"2016-01-13",3.9,"Golden with light haze topped with a white head. Tropical sweet fruits, musty, sour, and Brett. Finish lingers with the Brett. Loads of tingly soft carbonation thin out the otherwise medium body. Tops.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
995,"2016-01-10",3.8,"375ml bottle pours a hazy pale brown color. Belgian yeast flavors with lots of Brett at the end.","California, USA","Bule"
995,"2015-12-06",3.6,"375mL bottle, pours a cloudy golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out light-to-medium bretty notes, some Belgian yeast, and biscuity notes. Flavour is very dry, with medium bretty notes, lots of Belgian yeast, and biscuity malts. High carbonation. Really good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
995,"2015-12-05",3.8,"Bottle - Sweet fruity tropical Brett notes. Cloudy gold with a rich bubbly white head. Very carbonated, sweet tropical fruity notes. Lots of funk and Brett.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
995,"2015-12-01",3.9,"Cool little stubby 12.7 ounce bottle. Corked and caged. Pours a cloudy bright orange color with a large white head. A light dough and fruity nose. Fresh vibrant funky fruity Brux, some toast, bready, some lemon, soft but very carbonated. Awesome.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
