4608,"2013-04-05",3.2,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2013 Bottle from Errl.  This pours a glowing golden-orange color woth a thin fizzy head.  The aroma is peachy, with bubblegum, light herbal notes, and yeast.  The flavor has this juicy fruit bubblegum taste with coriander and dusty notes, but not much funky yeast.  Theres a lot of wheat throughout; white grapes, and a bit tart overall.  The rye is noticeable but I wouldnt call it spicy.  At first I thought this was too sweet and thick in the body, but its not really.  I cant say I really enjoyed it though.  It definitely grew on me but something just didnt seem right.  It lacks the delicate nature I look for this type of beer.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Taste is also dominated by quite a bit of tart notes with some light spicy rye notes that are also perceptible. Body is quite full with medium carbonation. Not bad but a lot more sour then expected which makes it hard to distinguish some of the rye malt.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

4608,"2012-03-12",3.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/23/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. Thanks to bauermj for bringing out some Texas beer.

My pour is a hazy golden straw color with a light white foamy head.

A lot of white grape and pear precedes the pale malt, green apple, and some dry rye malt in the nose. 

The flavor is sweeter than I would expect in a rye beer or a saison. It starts with dry, crackery pale malt, sweet white grape, pear, green apple, some lemon and pepper. 

It starts sweet, although it is tough to identify the flavor to associate the sweetness with. There is a rye dryness that develops over the course of the beer. A lightly tart and bitter finish. 

The dry rye flavor and the sweetness work reasonably well together.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

4608,"2010-12-01",3.9,"A: The pour is a very cloudy pale yellow color with a huge white head that eventually settles down.

S: An incredibly fruit forward nose that you dont typically expect. The requisite orange aroma is there, but also lots of apricots and pineapple too. Sweet wheat bread, coriander, and a bit of rye to finish it off.

T: Again, lots of fruit notes of pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, and fresh oranges. Hearty and sweet wheat bread, bitter orange peel, coriander, and a subtle rye flavor.

M: The body is medium and so is the carbonation.

D: Too bad this one was only 84 bottles as I thought it was fantastic. Definitely different for a witbier, which is sort of a blah style to me, and it made it very interesting and enjoyable.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

The aroma is spicy, banana, citrus and has a bready quality to it that comes off as banana bread, nice. Really a good aroma. The taste starts off with a thick mouthfeel that caught me off guard, but is nice-like someone shoveled thick liquid bread in my mouth with some banana and citrus flavors. This is a good beer by Freetail and very refreshing for 8.7% especially just coming inside from the heat. And the alcohol is not that noticeable at all.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"
