1664,"2014-05-24",3.5,"Pretty good to the style except moderately over carbonated for what it is. Light roast and little to no sweetness as expected. Could have used a richer creamier presence without being quite so sharp and ""spritzy"" feeling. Not bad.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1664,"2014-03-16",3.6,"@ Peekskill. Pours black with decent tan head. Aroma of roasted malts and some chocolate. Taste brings much of the same. Leans toward the bitter end of the stout spectrum, but in the roasted malt way as opposed to hops. Get some rye in there as well. Pretty dry on the palate and quite spritzy. Get a lot of the carbonation and acidic twang in the mouthfeel. At least with this beer it works decently well. Recently Ive found it detracts from the experience. Gotta do it right. Finish is roasty bitter with lightly lingering rye graininess. Pretty solid beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

1664,"2013-08-16",3.7,"Draught. Pours with a big billowy brown head leaving lace. Aroma has a striking savory meaty quality that jumps past the chocolate and roast. The taste is roasty sweet like a proper Irish stout with a more dark coffee dust and charcoal bitterness. Similar meaty quality. Ends a tad lactic. Feel is super soft though the roast starts to dominate. Really nice though odd.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
