745,"2013-07-30",4.2,"Appearance: dark but clear reddish purple, with a creamy dark tan head and average lacing; really pretty.  Aroma: malty, sweet, and dark fruit aromas dominate; smells rustic, and theres a little chocolate too.  Taste: 	sweet, thick malts suggest some spicy rye, light molasses, even some oats, while dark stone fruits, vanilla, and black pepper wait underneath with a bit of raisin. Finish: lingering sweetness (not cloying), with a hint of boozy warmth. Notes: On tap at Brewers, down in the cave. Really, really good. Malty and sweet, but not too sweet, with a good amount of balance in the palate. I love a good rye beer, and this was excellent. Reminded me a lot of Boulevard Brewings Rye on Rye, but just lighter on the alcohol and in the palate.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

Dry, light body and medium carbonation. Smells like malt, molasses, gingerbread.","baltimore, Maryland, USA","snoworsummer"
745,"2013-07-21",3.5,"Tap. Pours clear, dark amber with creamy off-white head. Aroma is cookie and caramel malts, rye, cocoa, light earthy notes, and dark fruit.

745,"2012-05-27",3.9,"Bottle shared at Ale Alpharetta.  Pours a dark amber with a small off white head leaving spotty lacing along the glass. The aroma is smoked malt, spicy rye, caramel, with vanilla and some booze.  The taste is still quite hot, but I dig that.  More spice, heat from the booze, chocolate.  Delicious.  I seriously bet this would age wonderfully.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
745,"2010-10-24",3.3,"Poured a hazy brown color with a light head.  Aroma has lots of rye with some chocolate malts.  Taste is quite malty with chocolate and rye.  The rye goes pretty well with the chocolate.  Slightly creamy.  Overall a pretty good rye beer.","Maryland, USA","scottw86"

745,"2010-01-18",4.2,"On tap at Brewers Art. Holy shit this effing rocks!!! Pours a very hazy light brown. Big artisan chocolate, cocoa, some light smoked malt on the nose. Palate is enormously buttery, caramel syrup, oily. Taste is full of chocolate, some campire, butterscotch. It is so rich. Awesome!!!","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
745,"2009-04-29",4.1,"Draft.  Amber-brown color with a nice foamy head.  Fresh malt aroma.  Luscious malty tones, reminiscent of a quality Bierre De Garde.  Smooth, fluffy, and mellow with a subtle twang.  This really does Rye right.  Mellow dark malty caramel tones.  Subtle and excellent.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
745,"2007-05-18",3.3,"A winner of a rye. Creamy vanilla with a dry rye taste is a great combo. A very earthy brew with thoughts of a grain field on a sunny day. This has a nice snap finish that keeps you wanting more.","Beertimore, Maryland, USA","Holdwine"

745,"2007-05-15",3.5,"Tap, Maxs American Craft Beer Fest, shared by egajdzis.  Pours a clear, medium cola color; white head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Malty, rye and vanilla aroma.  Light carbonation.  Medium bodied, roasted rye and light coffee (or maybe just roasted rye character) upfront; followed by an almost buttery popcorn character (?) - in any event: creamy, velvety mouthfeel.  Medium, toasted rye and roasted malt finish.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
745,"2007-05-15",3.0,"Rye ale, draft at Maxs.  Pours a clear deep ruby red color.  Smells a bit of musty, soggy grains, the rye is certainly helping with that, since I usually equate rye aromas with soggy grains... texture is smooth and a bit creamy, full of husky, coarse rye and raw barley flavors.  A little buttery at times.  OK.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
745,"2007-05-15",3.7,"[Draft @ Maxs] Poured a dark amber color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of rye, very bready, with some caramel, and nuts as well.  Taste was much of the same, strong rye, with nuts and caramel. A nice showcase of a rye beer, without the caraway spicings.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
