AROMA: As with most there is a very citric sharp smell along with fresh berries and obvious Brett.

TASTE: Wild berries, jam, Bretty funk.

PALATE: Syrupy, long lasting, moreish, very low carbonation. 

OVERALL: As with Framboos, I think these beers are good to try and I know with thanks to these beers what my limits are. Basically a Lou Pepe Framboise for half the price is a better beer IMO.

It's tart and crisp and everything I want it to be. The flavor is unbelievable. The cherry and raspberry meld together so well. It's all kinds of sexual. The tart sourness and crispness of both fruits is amazing. The mouth feel is fantastic. Light and crisp with a beautiful bubbly carbonation and a lingering raspberry cherry. It's magnificent. Oh man.

Pours a vibrant pink, crimson red color, with a small, fizzy white head, leaving back a bubbly lacing at the edge of the glass.

The fruits are quite apparent on the nose, surprisingly even more defined by cherry than raspberry, while both create a great blend among a funky tartness. A certain ripeness from the fruits introduces a moldy, leathery earth component, complimenting the stone qualities of the fruits, up to a jammy, sweet peak. Apart from this, the fruits create a fresh, almost unripe impression, highlighting the prickly raspberry stone pits among wet hay and crisp lemon peel.

Has a lively, yet soft carbonation to it, resulting in a refreshing but smooth mouthfeel, with a mineral quality during the beers finish, complimenting its tartness perfectly. 

Tastes of lemon peel, dusty, old malts together with wet hay, creating the foundation of this beer. Raspberry and cherry settle among this immediately, adding a rich fruitiness during the mid palate, perfectly blending into the beers lemon tartness during the finish. This lends a noteable sweetness to the otherwise pleasantly tart beer, sticking to its lambic roots, while adding an awesome complexity.

Its fruitiness is certainly a pleasant addition, while complimenting to the pungent tartness during the beers typical, teeth drying finish. A soothing stony mineral quality tames the prominent lemon in this, while highlighting a short, sweet peak from the fruits, adding pleasantly to the body of the beer.","GERMANY","aleigator"

4413,"2015-12-02",4.6,"(750ml 2013 bottle @ Grote Dorst, Eizeringen, Nov 15 2015, split w/ phyllomedusa) Pours a lightly hazed light red-brown with a small dense lingering ring of whitish head, no lace. Aroma is so so very jammy, lovely raspberry and no small amount of sour cherry preserve given the proportions. A little caramel malt for body, fairly light lactic yogurt tang, bready hints, some oak and moderate wet barnyard funk laying over everything. Flavour is again jammy as anything Ive ever drank, raspberry and tart cherry with a touch of supporting caramel up front, and wet earthy Brett. Sweetness is balanced by a moderate level of lemon yoghurt acidity in the middle with oak and raspberry seeds. Finish is fairly dry, moderately sour and a bit wine-like with persistent cherry and tart raspberry, a little astringency from the oak and fruit, and barnyard still present to match. Very long fruity aftertaste. Medium bodied with a little more heft than your average lambic and soft but tingling effervescent carb. Wow. Hard to do justice to, this is just a sensational fruit lambic. Complex and nuanced and yet such a jammy, honest extraction of the fruit character as well.

M- light to medium sticky body with a medium acetic palate with good carbonation. 

T- good, but not exactly living up to the hype. Sour cherries, salt and lemons are strong up front. Mid palate is raspberries, grass, and vinegar. End is long and tart with lemon juice, grapefruit, sour cream and extra sharp cheddar funk wrapping it up.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"

4413,"2014-01-01",4.4,"750ml bottle, 1st batch. Original review 11-09-2010.

Pours dark ruby red (this was the last of the bottle), off-white head, some spotty lacing along the side of the glass, and a medium ring around the glass and some bubbles here and there on top of the glass with some wisps. Nose is sour cherries, oak, funk. Just wonderful to sniff over and over. Not overly complex but it gets straight to the point of awesomeness. The funk, oak, and cherries are wonderful. Flavor is raspberries, cherries, oak, funk, sour/tart notes. A little bit of each of these characteristics meld together to create one helluva blend. I get a lot of sour cherries, raspberries, and oak. Light body, crisp, fizzy carbonation, dry finish.

4413,"2013-12-30",4.1,"Batch #2, bottled 6/26/2013. Deep, intense red hue yields fizzy pink-white bubbles that fade quickly. 

Dark, freshly crushed raspberry aroma atop the distinct smell of a 3F fruited lambic. Distinctive; unique. Is it wrong to label this their ""house yeast strain""? 

Raspberries are fresh and, again, dark. Musty, cheesy, and an effervescent feel without actually being over-carbed. Feels almost gritty in the mouth. A totally different approach compared to the Cantillon raspberry lambics. 

Mild pucker at the end. Not particularly sour, just damn complex and tasty. Fruit will fade, but this should age like a champ otherwise. Need to get my hands on some b1.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

Hommage pours a hazy crimson color with just a tiny wisp of an off white head.  

The raspberries are definitely noticeable in the nose, although the cherries are surprisingly prominent.  A strong tart aroma has a strong acetic vinegar component to it.  The acidity in the aroma seems to mostly overwhelm any funky wild elements that might be there.

Cherry is actually the stronger flavor coming through with my first sip.  Tart cherries, overripe cherry skin, sour raspberry, red grapes, oak, and balsamic vinegar all come together nicely.  The flavor has a gentle sweetness up front and then strikes a nice balance between fruity tartness and acetic vinegar.  There is a slightly off-putting plasticy note that comes through at the beginning of the sip, but other than that this is very enjoyable.

It has a nice, smooth, medium body for a lambic that is peppered with vinegar acidity.  The carbonation is on the lighter side of medium, and there is a slightly oaky and tannic finish.

This is clearly a well-crafted lambic.  I thought that raspberries would be the dominant fruit, but I was not disappointed that the cherries came through so strongly.  The plastic flavor in the flavor was enough for me to knock down the flavor and overall score, but everything else was solid.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Pours a murky purple, brownish red with little head formation on the pours. Its rather ""dirty"" looking in comparison to Framboos. Nose is surprisingly full of raspberry still, some very light vinegar, and slightly phenolic. Raspberries are prominent in the flavor as well, with a little bit of plastic peaking through as well. There is less funk than usual 3F of this vintage, but I am actually ok with it considering how much fruit is still showing. Moderate mouthfeel, heavy acidity, light carbonation, and a long finish. I think a lot of the slack this beer gets is unwarranted. It holds up very well to Framboos and despite having some plastic character to it, it doesnt detract much from the beer.

Rating #2,000. For a milestone like this I had to break out a big gun. Rooting around in the cellar I found this to share with about a dozen others at a pre-GTMW tasting. Preceded by another monster (Blauw) it was the perfect way to finish an evening. I dont know how many bottles are still in the wild but I would love to try this one again. Even after five years it is fresh and tart.

Aroma / Appearance - The rosy red pour looks like someone blended a pound of raspberries then filtered out the pulp. Sparkling and brilliant it has only a trace of carbonation. The nose is sharp, acidic, and pure raspberries. It isnt rich and complex but it doesnt try to be blunt either. Despite the intensity it has an approach that makes it inviting and savory.

Flavor / Palate - Each sip is more intense than the one before until the taste buds begin to melt. Sharp raspberries taste like licking a handful which have been powdered with the residue from a bag of Sour Patch Kids. This top notch beer is something that American brewers can continue use as the ultimate benchmark. Somehow I think few will come anywhere close.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The beer is ruby hued with an oily, thin head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very musty, funky, and fruity. Dank basement comes to mind. The flavor is quite tart, with plenty of raspberries and a hint of cherries. Also a bit of oddness and bandaids, though these characteristics dont completely overrun the beer. The finish brings a puckering sensation in the cheeks (the ones on your face). A quality lambic. Recommended.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

4413,"2012-05-31",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2012 Enjoyed this beer in 75CL format at Delirium Cafe in Brussels. Paid about 20 Euro for it and it was served in a Gueuze glass at cellar temp (around 60 Degrees F). I gave one third of the bottle to the bartenders who were interested in trying it. 

A - Absolutely zero pop of the cork. It just came right off with no hiss. I poured rather vigorously and had a quarter finger head that subsided quickly. Slight amount of bubbles on the edge of the glass. SRM was around 29. It was a dark blood red appearance that looks like raspberry skins or maybe plums depending on the light. 

S - Big grape scent. Im getting a nice oak backbone and pears. Raspberries clearly dominate the smell but age is starting to creep up it seems with lemon zest also coming through and a funky barnyard scent. 

T - Wow. Huge raspberry notes but the expected power feels a bit muted. Its big but not bold if that makes sense. Fading fruit seems to be common in beers of this type. No, the taste is slightly more vinegar than raspberry. Slightly tasting shoe polish and some chemical aspects to this beer. I get a decent level of cherries and ripe fruits.

M - Surprisingly, the carbonation while drinking had held up well. 10% carbonation on the mouth swish. Medium body and an incredible red wine dry finish. 

O - This is a unicorn beer for a lot of people. Its very tasty but has started to show signs of age. It could have been a complete sour bomb but has held up nicely. It would have been great to have this fresh.

*Update: I drank the sediment at the finish. Why not? Turned the beer less fruit and more bread like. Taste moved to a musky finish and more oak characteristics with some rotten grape. Still delicious.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Arôme est terreux, framboise garde un très beau bouquet fruité entre framboise et cerise qui prennent le dessus. On se rend tout de suite compte que 3F laisse loin derrière les qcq coupeurs qui eux préfèrent rajouter du sucre. On a donc ici, du vrai avec les fruits qui contribuent grandement au bouquet de cette bière, et garde même avec les années un bouquet très frais.

En bouche, aigreur prenante au palais avec ce profond profile framboise qui est divin, oscillant entre un côté champenoise et fruité de lambic donnant pleine vie aux framboises pour se développer. Ces dernières laissent une fin de bouche en picotement ui couvre le dessus du palais et la gorge. Vraiment une bière à déguster, et ces notes ne lui font pas vraiment justice.

Yet this was not a complete stunner as the first time I got it. Dont know if its because of batch 2 or because my taste buds changed or whatever.

Brettanomyces, barnyard and a lush, velvety touch of raspberry, which provides just the right amount of sweetness to create a near perfect balance - everything just comes together wonderfully.

4413,"2012-02-21",4.1,"HUGE thanks to xpimptastikx for bringing this beer to our impromptu/epic tasting last night. 750ml corked & caged bottle into a Ranger Creek tulip.

Hommage pours with a rosy, violet-amber hue studded with a fine yeasty haze. A pink, Valentines day head retains surprisingly well. Gorgeous beer! Sadly, the aroma has not held up to age as well as the appearance. Big phenolic notes greet the nose alongside a leathery, cheesy, funky armpit presence. Cooked asparagus and green olives were suggested, and I agree. However, sniff past the pickled funkiness and there are some nice acetic berry tones lurking beneath.

All is forgiven upon the first sip. This Lambic is heavenly in flavor, with a super tart lactic punch to the sides of the tongue offset by a decadent, funky raspberry jam note in the middle. Mouthfeel is dry, tart, and refreshing with a perfect carbonation level. Overall, an amazing beer; I am grateful that I got the opportunity to try Hommage. Its a shame the nose hadnt held up, but the deliciousness more than makes up for that fact. Thanks again Michael!","Austin, Texas, USA","dreddy"

A - Pours like carbonated cranberry juice as an inch of light pink head arises. A thin sheet stays around for awhile and leaves light lacing on the glass.

S - This is the wild card for this beer. First I got a very light raspberry jam followed by band aids, which seemed to have layers of musty cheese and pickled eggs. Someone else said green olives. There are raspberries, but they sit under some heavy funk layers.

T - Bright fresh raspberries still, raspberry jam, slightly acetic, but still a heavy dose of wet hay and cheese. Light vegital aftertaste. A better balance here than the nose, and my favorite fruit lambic from 3F.

M - light creamy carbonation with a nice oaky tannic finish, it leaves you lingering for more.

O - My favorite 3F fruit lambic to date. The nose was not as good as it could have been, but age might have something to do with that.

A - Pours murky pinkish red with a small half finger tall fizzy white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving little to no lace down the glass.

S - Smell is all over the place. Hints of tart raspberries initially quickly changing with what I can only imagine sulfuric acid to smell like, ok maybe just some strong vinegar. It then changes again to dank basement funk and some medicinal band-aid. I can only imagine how this smelled fresh.

T - Starts off with a mix of tart raspberries and lactic sourness slowly giving way to a strong mineral flavor. Hints of vinous fruit skins, wet hay, dulled citric fruit and wet oak make up the rest of this one. Finish is very dry, lingering on the pallet for quite awhile.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tart, dry feel with quite a bit of pucker, lingering for some time after consumption.

O - This beer really did live up to its reputation, changing nearly every time I took a sip. The pucker is strong but it is still manageable. I hope they do make this again, I would love to try it fresh.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

4413,"2011-04-24",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2012 Huge thanks to ygtbsm94 for opening this bottle last weekend. Served in a Bruery tulip.

Pour yields a bright red body with a thin white head that nearly immediately fades to a thin collar around the edges. The nose brings forward some slight earth along with quite a bit of musty raspberry. In the background, theres a bit of light oak. Overall, the nose is kind of like a damp vineyard. Theres a bit of bandaid lingering in the background of the nose, though this disappears in the flavor. Taste has a good amount of raspberry and damp earth. Light wood and a moderate amount of acidity. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a sour, dry finish. Not too much funk anywhere, more toward a light earthiness. Overall, a very nice beer with the mouthfeel as the highlight.

Hopefully it was just the bottle I got, or I should say that my wife got. I couldnt get past one sip. Maybe it was bad storage or an infection, but this was a horrible beer.

S-this has some light earthy funk notes to it, hints of leathery brett, bright ripe raspberries that are dried out but fresh, reasonably sour and light acidity in the nose.

T-the funk is again earthy but very light, the brett is more pronounced and assertive adding leather in with the tart green raspberry, there seems to be some juicy cherry as the raspberries are dry and sweet with a hint of tartness and light acidity in the finish.

M-lighter body, very juicy creamy feel to it with a moderate carbonation and hint of driness.

D-this has a nice little balance to it.  not the funk I would have expected from a drie fonteinen beer but the fruit flavor is very pronounced.  actually more acidic than I thought it would be but not burning.  the body is so juicy and creamy on the palate it is very inviting.  the flavors are subtle and well integrated.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

Hommage pours medium amber red and not too dark to see through. The smell is crazy! I get very rotten, sweet fruit--especially raspberry--along with funky puke, poop, rhubarb & cheese. The taste definitely connects to the smell, but is much less offensive to me with tons of funky raspberry & hearty fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is not very dry, but a bit sweet.

4413,"2010-10-03",4.3,"750mL from Maxs in Baltimore. Celebrating my 1700th rating with Travlr. Pours a murky pink (later will look like brown mud with the massive yeast sediment) with a medium, rocky, pinkish white head. Excellent retention. No lace. Aroma starts off as phenolic, sort of band-aid kriek, but moves thankfully to cherry pie, raspberry sorbet, raspberry yogurt, fresh pears, some spicy sourness, very rich and complex. Taste is perfection- massively lactic with a major mouth-watering component that forces to drink this is giant gulps and unfortunately it is hard to keep this rarity in the glass to savor. You want more every second. Raspberry yogurt, grape seed, fresh cherries, light spicy white wine vinegar. Lactic sourness moves to a bit spicy, all-encompassing sour for a split second before the palate is zipped away into a fresh, understated dryness. The coating mouthfeel leaves you with an oily texture on the palate even though the body here is spritzy, refreshing.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

4413,"2010-08-20",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2012 2007 bottle shared with the wife on August 14 2010 at Kulminator in Antwerpen.
A: A lighter shade of cherry red best describes the fairly transparent body. Moderate sized pinkish head didnt stick around long and only left behind the faintest traces of lacing on the glass.
S: Mmm. A bright tart raspberry aroma finds its way to the nose immediately upon the beers arrival at our table. A little sweet with just a hint of cherry notes. Good oak presence but not a whole lot of musty funk, however.
T: Gentle raspberry sweetness and tartness from start to finish. Oak and funk take a bit of a back seat to the fruityness. A little shiraz like fruity pepper. 
M: Smooth with a moderate effervescence. Despite the sweetness of the raspberries up front, Hommage finishes nice and dry. Solid, but not mind melting tartness.

Lots of tannins abound that will prop this up for years. Raspberries and tart cherries, clean acid. Some cheesy notes, in a good way.

The pour was ruby-mahoganey, nice generous pink colored head, steady carbonation bubbles rising to the top. The aroma was tart raspberries, funky barnyard elements, oak, and I guess cherries. The flavor followed, raspberries tart but not over the top, a pretty unoffensive but assertive sour brew, lighter fruits underneath, oaky finish. The mouthfeel was clean, acidic, featuring even a faint residual sweetness, perhaps. Excellent, shoulda bought two bottles on the day I saw this out of the few it was on the shelf at SL a year and a half ago or so.","","User37895"

Reddish pink color with a sparkling pink head that settles quickly.

A great smell, clean and well defined. Great aromas of tart raspberries and cherries. The fruitiness is very pleasant, acidic, genuine and pulpy. Some gentle funky notes. Grass, earth and yeast - the usual lambic suspects are present but subdued due to the fresh fruitiness.

The taste follows suit with a beautiful fruit character of semi-sweet and tart raspberries and cherries. Pleasant acidic character all the way. The fruits are just unbelievably well defined and rich. Notes of grass, dusty cellar, earth and just a hint of funky wet hay. Fruit pits, some barrel notes. The finish is very dry and rather sparkling with a nice sourness and lingering fruit aromas. A very gentle, well balanced and pleasant taste.

Medium body, gentle yet active carbonation.

This is a fantastic beer. Great, razor sharp fruit profile and clean flavors. Good balance between the fruits and the rustic lambic flavors. Refreshing and easy to drink.

4413,"2010-01-02",4.7,"Bottle @ Ebenezers. Beautiful pour; dark rose/plum pour with an effervescent head. Aroma is magnificent; start is an insane raspberry character that melds into cherry. From there, a woody and vanilla tone emerges, with some interesting spice ideas, much like nutmeg. Throughout all of these stages, a beautifully mellow barnyard funkiness provides the foundation of the nose. Flavor is out of control; the tart cherry is phenomenal, and the raspberry sweetness compliments it adeptly. Really nice secondary tier of flavors includes pear, apple cider, oak, and grape skin. Palate is full, with a bone dry finish. Exceptional lambic.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
4413,"2010-01-02",4.7,"The pour is a murky rose in color  with a patchy white veneer. Aroma is bursting and vivacious with loads of pureed raspberries that culminate with distinct funken cherry notes near the end. Further notes are prolific and hard hitting, manifesting in with wet hay, straw, barn, and subtle earthen funk. The flavor makes my jaw drop with wonder and intrigue. Massive raspberry is prevalent, while the sour cherry is accentuated by the wild yeast arrangement. Pear and apple with mild notes of acetic acid, grapeseed, and super subtle tannins. The palate is full, mildly effervescent, slippery in the body, and dry in the finish. Perhaps the best fruit lambic Ive ever had.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

The flavor is a nice, creamy cheesiness with a very assertive sourness under it. The raspberry is rather evident, but I have to struggle to pick up any cherry. There is plenty of oak and general woodiness, as well as a bit of zesty character.

The aroma is boggling my nose with its depth and complexity. I can pick out cherries, fresh wood, sourness, basement, barnyard, cloth. I could probably sniff this all day and not really come to a solid conclusion. The flavor is less sour than I was lead to believe, tough still with a tartness. I find hints at cherry, muscadine, oak, and a lingering honeycomb quality in the finish, oh and cheesecake.

Not an overwhelming yeast at all though, very mild mannered for a lambic...or maybe ive just had too many :-P  Unlike most raspberry dominated lambics this one has a flavor of overripened fruits rather than unripe ones.

Barnyard funk aroma that is very earthy with some ashy oaky wood. The raspberries have faded a bit by this point and there is a somewhat scorched earth, moldy musty character. The fruit is there although it seems concentrated and I could swear that I could even smell the seeds.

Extremely tart, sour and funky. Very puckering and lip smacking while only mildly acidic. Lots of sweet dry raspberry buried beneath the barnyard lactic funkiness. As in the aroma, the raspberries have faded but they are still evident. This beer is intensely sour but is somewhat balanced by the sweetness of the berries. There is also some earthy oak and vanilla notes and a very sour puckering dry acidity with some more acidity coming through. The burnt ashy wood character from the aroma comes through a bit.

I cant believe how sour this beer has become with the aging. I wish I could have tried this fresh to see how prominent the berries were. Either way this beer is very complex with lots of delicious flavors bouncing off of one another. I picked something else up with each sip. Im not the biggest fan of raspberry beers or raspberries for that matter but this beer was very impressive. All sour heads should seek this one out.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

So much raspberry fruit, its stunning.  Brilliant clear red orange colour, with disappearing slight pink head.  Raspberry, cherry and a touch of funk.  Lovely in mouth, smooth, bit too carbonated, so I had to do a bit of decanting to get rid of the bubbles, but then this swallow of pippy raspberry and sourness starts and lingers into one of the best finish of a beer Ive had.  So easily a 10 for aroma, a five for appearance.  The flavour amazing, just maybe too much verging on the vinegar.  The sourness is excellent with just that touch of funk.

Upon taking the foil off I can already smell this stuff (cork still in... a synthetic cork too, what the hell is up with that?). Pours a beautiful raspberry ruby red with a slight purple hue and a small pink head that took a bit of aggression to stir up, and which faded pretty quickly to a pink ring. Aroma is very fresh and funky - smells like bitter tart cherries upfront followed by sweet and very enticing fresh raspberries. The typical 3F musty, funky, wild character is there as well, and works great with the fruity aroma.  The flavor lacks the sweetness hinted at in the aroma but is still very pleasant.  Bitter tart raspberries upfront that lend to the funky barnyard character that follows through the moderately dry and acidic finish.  Very well blended.  Not one of the IN-YOUR-FACE lambics, but there is much to appreciate in the subtleties and the freshness of the fruity quality of this one.  Medium bodied with meidum to minimal carbonation, which to me is PERFECT for this style.  Overcarbonation -despite ebing a standard quality for many lambics- is a turn off to me.

4413,"2009-05-20",3.3,"750 ml bottle from Bieropholie, shared by Ben (thanks), served cold in a goblet. AP24/09.
App.:  Cloudy, very reddish-amber, remnants of an off-white head.
  
Aroma:  A good dose of barnyard funk, light ammonia, light rubber, some nice juicy raspberry and raspberry bush, white pepper, plenty of organic acids, sour cherries, leathery, raspberry seeds.
  
Palate:  Medium-ish body, fairly sparse effervescence, a bit astringent.
  
Flav.:  Lots of tart raspberries, some cherry, quite a bit fruitier than the nose; minerals and funky organic acids, barnyard and leather, bitter green herbs, quite sour and bitter with light funk and mineral-fruit.

Seriously seedy, fresh, juicy rapsberries in the nose, vibrant, sticky, hugely forward and intense in the aroma.  Musty, sour seedy raspberries, and not just sour from the lambic yeast, but actual sourness from the raspberries, very much an under-ripe, seedy, hugely fruity and juicy.  Amazingly complex, juicy, fruity, tart, sour, everything I want in framboise. (4.2)


2007 750ml bottle consumed March 2009.  Clean first pour reveals cola-like carbonation that fizzles dead quickly on top of a clear and bright ruby red body.  Lactic acid melds exquisitely with the raspberries, but this clean pour seems to lack depth and comes across as plain and subtle.  Subsequent pours with some yeast mixed in reveals significantly more depth in the nose.  Body is spritzy, theres some medicinal notes in there, some aspirin, etc.  Good but not mind-blowing.  Decent balance of lactic acid and acetic acid (resembles Flemish red, actually) which seems to stem from the raspberries themselves.  Nice, but somewhat underwhelming.  Maybe this one truly does need a few more years, but I think its more to do with the base gueuze blend of 3F at the time they made this (look at 2006 and 2007 oude gueuze, its not exactly the best example of the beer theyve made).

Unfortunately this marvelous beer has not been brewed for a while, but the brewer told he was thinking of making it again
With some friends we shared a bottle at the 3 fonteinen restaurant.
It is a shiny deep red brew with a pretty pinkish head. It has a delightful, fresh fruit aroma, with champagne and some honey.
The taste is beautiful fruit, nice acidity and tartness, reminding of champagne and red wine.

Beautiful color, appearance is completely flat.  Aroma shows awesome signs of funk and fruit.  Total fruit bomb.  Juicy, ripe, intense raspberries.  Wow that it is an amazing fruit aroma.  There is a slight medicinal quality to this, or it could just be a reminder of other Raspberry wine/mead/beers Ive had that were bad or medicinal.  Vanilla and floral notes are also apparent.  Barnyard is pretty subtle, funk is more of a urinal/lemon rind quality.  Taste is very fruity, acidic, dry, tart.  A long, lemony raspberry finish.  This is nice.

Lots of raspberry, but it never becomes overly sweet or sticky. Some straw, funk,  and yeast in the background. Some hay-type notes in the background.  Very sour on the palate. The funk, sourness, and fruit come together almost perfectly.

By this I mean the raspberry is so real it transcends the lambicness at times, then just melds with it. A stony, pitty aroma presence, minerally at times, runs around in waves. The color is incredibly gorgeous, with the hints of tan increasing thoughts of leather in the horse barn. Flavors are somewhat acetic, somewhat lactic, sweet and sour and leathery. Incredible back of the throat sourness. Palate lets down just the tiniest bit; first brawny and slippery and thick, then with the feeling of a slight watery hole. A truly great beer.

4413,"2008-05-08",3.9,"Bottle (Feb 07 bottling).

Head is initially small, fizzy, pink, fully diminishing.
Body is hazy medium reddish-purple, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately yeasty (horseblanket, barnyard, cobwebs), with notes of raspberry and cherry, light notes of band-aid, sour apple, and wood.

Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively/soft carbonation.

I rarely say this, but thats because I rarely believe its true: this will probably benefit greatly from another couple of years in the bottle.  Although the aroma is very enticing and vibrant, its pretty fruit-forward right now, as with young wine (and priced like the latter as well, at least in the States...$35 a bottle here in Colorado).  I would also ideally want a smidge less sweetness and a smidge more tartness. These are nits...its great stuff as-is to be sure.  And given a few years for the fruits to fade a bit and some aged characters to take their place, I have little doubt that it will gain more depth and breadth.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Salty barnyard and oceanic funk.  A sharp bite of ginger and tangy vinaigrette leads the flavor to cut the cheeks, before settling into a rounded, damp cheese mold, wet oceanwater fur and dried grass character; lots of phenol and sweaty yeast impartation.  Lovely, with a firm burst of lactic acid leaking out from the bed of raspberry and dead cherry.  Taut and precise, but offset with plenty of wild recklessness in the mouth.

Served lightly chilled at 60*F+
A careful pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a two-finger thick, faintly pink tinged, off-white colored head.  The beer is a deep red hue that shows a stunningly, brilliantly clear, bright red color that has touches of gold to it when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of raspberry pits as I pour it and a deeper inspecting yields sweet raspberry flesh followed by medicinal phenolics, a touch of plastic notes and just a big Brettanomyces presence.  The finish is quite phenolic all in all, but serves as a balancing note to the up front expressive fruit and light lactic tartness. 

Quite dry tasting, which is quite different than young bottles, with a solid lactic tartness, a woody raspberry pit note, sour raspberry flesh and a medicinal / phenolic finish that doesnt come on quite as strong as it did in the nose.  The body is quite creamy; perhaps even a touch slick, with a fullness that plays quite well with the other senses.  This still has quite a chewy raspberry flavor to it, but now that it has dried out it is much more woody, more tannic seeming and has that green, almost vegetal quality that all dry, heavily fruited raspberry beers always get.  I should mention that there is still some sweetness to this beer, it is well on its way towards drying out, but this will dry out even further over the coming years.

I will say that this still has quite a few years of life yet.  It will also likely get better than it currently is; it should dry out a bit more, with much of the phenolics being changed and softened with time and perhaps other funky notes coming to the fore.  This is still quite good, but I think I liked this better when it was fresh.  There isnt enough developed funk and complexity in this right now to offset the loss of the fresh raspberry component that this had when young; I still have high hopes for this improving quite a bit over the next couple years though.  So, in the end this is a bit simplistic to be a world class Lambic (at least this particular snapshot), though visually and texturally this is currently just about perfect.
February 2007 Bottle Date, Sampled January 2008
3.9: 8/3/8/4/16
A light carbonation for a bottle conditioned Lambic, the beer pours with a head that starts out one finger thick in height and is a pinkish stained, pale tan color.  The beer sits in my glass a deep, cherry red color and shows a bright, lightly hazed, cranberry color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite fruit focused at first with aromas of cherries and raspberries being noticed.  The raspberry note is not quite as dominant as I was expecting and cherry like aromatics come through more than I was expecting.  I think a big part of this is the particular type of raspberries used here; they dont have that huge, sticky, in your face raspberry distinctness that one usually finds; instead it is a much more fleshy, fruity, softer raspberry character that is almost cherry like at times.  The pure fruit focus of the aroma quickly dissipates to a mix of fruit and typically funky Lambic aromatics.  Musty, worn leather, moldy cotton, damp cellar notes, aged-damp wood aromas, uriatic acid, definite barnyard butyric notes, wild mushroom notes and perhaps a hint of ripe cheese all are quite noticeable and in fact become the more noticed part of the aroma.

Tart, yet not grippingly so, the beer is very dry.  For some reason I was expecting a bit of residual sweetness, but I am glad there is none.  The acidity of this beer has both the typical Lambic notes to it, but also a fruity acidity that is definitely berry like.  This is a pretty soft interpretation of a Lambic, the acidity is certainly not overpowering here.  This has quite a bit of body; fruit tannins and woody tannic textures add a heft to this brew.  Fleshy cherry flavors up front yield to smooth raspberry notes towards the middle and lingering on into the finish.  A bit of raspberry seed character (slightly tannic, a touch nutty, but definitely raspberry) is also found in the finish.  Butyric acid notes add a soft funky note that underlies the entire flavor profile; sometimes sharp, with notes of musty leather, something a bit like a liquid phenolic-plastic soaked cotton ball, touches of damp wood and a light oak character.

As my palate gets used to the acidity and funk, the fruit flavors become more noticeable; specifically the raspberry notes pick up in intensity a bit.  A bright, yet still bone dry, raspberry pulp flavor with touches of cherry flesh to it.  The carbonation of this beer is definitely on the light side (especially for a bottle conditioned Lambic), but it does add a certain texture to the beer and allows for that tannic heft to come into play a bit more.  The second pour of my 750ml bottle just seems to disappear far faster than I would like it to; this is so drinkable and tasty.

Not as intensely fruity as I was perhaps expecting, and it is on the soft side for a traditional Lambic (even for a 3 Fonteinen one).  A bit harder, with a more pronounced fruit character would make this just about perfect.  It seems to be missing that jam-like (sans sweetness of course) fruit intensity that I was expecting, though I like that this is quite dry and quaffable.  Still this is a very good beer, though I have a feeling this wont age nearly as well as the Framboos has / did.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4413,"2007-12-17",4.4,"Bottle from JoeinUccle. Thanks Joe!  Shared with my friend Leah upon her return from Cali. She appreciates good lambics and I appreciate her for that. I was really excited when I heard this beer was being made (assuming it would be the same as the framboos last bottled in 1999).  After finding out it was a totally different beer, I was a little upset, but that didnt mean I wasnt dying to try it. After all, it is a fruit lambic (one of my favorite styles) and its made by 3 Fonteinen. Well, I wasnt disappointed. Pours a deep pinkish red with some wispy white lace. Nose is funky, but not over the top acidic, with some fruity aspects of the raspberries and cherries within. Also smelled some oak. Flavor is smooth and very nice.  Adequate tartness throughout, not over-the-top sour like some vintage cantillons, but a very nice fruity tartness that is just a pleasure to drink.  Like the doesjel, this stuff is so incredibly drinkable I think my parents might even like it.  I always use to think that the more sour a lambic was, the more complex it was (or the more I would enjoy it), but thats not always the case. Sometimes youre in the mood for something more mellow. Would be interested to see if this grows more sour and funky over time, but Im glad I had a taste of this now.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

4413,"2007-11-23",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2011 
In short: An excellent soft and juicy raspberries & cherries lambic.
How: Montreal-crew sour-beer tasting.  Bottle from Goldorak.  Fresh, drank a few months after it came out.
The look: Cloudy red body with almost no head
In long: Very fruity beer.  Raspberries of course but also quite a bit of cherries.  A little spicy on the tongue (thyme and cinnamon) but just a little.  Lambic part of the beer keeps a low profile behind the mountain of fruits.  A little more funkyness and acidity would have been great.  Maybe time will balance it off a bit.  Carbonation is very soft, maybe a bit too much so.  Compared to its predecessor (3F Framboos) the Hommage is softer, juicier, less funky and a lot less aggressive.  As it stands I also prefer the Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus over the Hommage.  Ill give it a year or two and see what happens.  Dont get me wrong the beer is good, very good.  Still I was a little disappointed but only because the original Framboos was so great.  Thats unfortunate but my expectations were as high the dudes in the three first rows of a Grateful Dead concert.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4413,"2007-11-18",4.4,"Courtesy dsnowden.  Pink-purple color with floes of white soapy head.  Grapeskins, raspberries on the aroma and a surprisingly low amount of sour or acetic aromas, but there is a nice bedrock of funk that the fruity aromas are lying on top of.  Taste is smooth, elegant, and vinous.  The fruit is well apparent and even with the sourness rather than bowled over by its intensity.  The finish is dry and moderately sour, and leaves the fruit and remnants of the yeasty funk behind on the palate.  A fantastic, well-balanced fruit lambic.","Florida, USA","JMFG"
4413,"2007-11-18",4.0,"Courtesy dsnowden.  Pours a dense, cloudy, star ruby grapefruit body.  A fizzy head quickly dissipates almost completely.  The aroma is like a fresh fruit garden.  Raspberries, strawberries, cherries and blackberries exude freshness, while moderately funky barnyard scents let you know this thing means business.  The flavor is sweeter than I was expecting, no doubt the result of the high fruit content.  Still, ample Drie Fonteinen sour funkiness is on full display, even if a bit less potent than usual.  The body is very lightly syrupy, with moderate liveliness. Finishes mostly dry and sour, with excellent concentrated fruit flavors.  The fruit really is the star of the show here.

The fruits and sourness almost blended together perfectly.  Not too sour or acidic, but not too fruity either.

4413,"2007-11-18",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Spicy, herbal ideas are rooted in bursting raspberries, leading to gum-licking sour goodness and the perfect dose of fruity sweetness. Drie Fonteinen have crafted another masterpiece of a lambic which should be phenomenal a few years from now.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-There is no ring of foam to crowns the deep red.
-The body is sturdy and carbonation suitably lively (yet it never impedes on the flavor profile).
-These wild herbal notes within the fruitiness are almost coniferous at times.
-When paired with its predecessor, 1999 Framboos, we could notice many similarities in the aroma, yet this Hommage was not as mature and cohesive flavor wise. 
-The juicy raspberry tartness makes you imagine a few seeds going by.
Addendum:
-This is already getting better and better. The nose is simply stunning and the flavor profile seems to be following now. A year or two from now, it could very well be as orgasmic as the Framboos.
-A 6-year-old bottle (in 2013) is just as fantastic!

4413,"2007-11-11",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2008 Sampled again with the montreal crew (late May), and it is stilll getting better.  The raspberry is coming out really nice- very jammy, red rasp fruit, cassis, and cherry on the nose.  Body is smoothing out a bit, plasticy notes are all but gone.  Acidity and extreme tartness need to come in, as well as more funk, but that will take time.  I have a feeling this will age really well.  
Just sampled again with Armand, and it seems that the raw plasticyness that I got about 4 months ago has mellowed nicely- the fruit almost springs out a bit more now, and the raspberries seem more ""real"" to me.  Lots of overall red fruits and even soem strawberry noticed int he aroma and flavor.  I have decided to bump it up from 4.2 to a 4.4 now.  Cant wait for this to come into the states.  Should be real soon now!!

750 ml bottle. thanks to Eric for sharing.  Pours a bright pinkish almost purple with red/bloody hints on the edges- good carbonation and a fizzy head which dissipates.  Aroma of chlorine, and bromine with some funky off raspberry and cherry pie- pedio character and a dirty burning diesel fuel with ethyl and butyl esters but somehow it is still pleasant.  Fruity lacto tartness upfront and more dirty sharp sour and acidic house character that most 3F beers have.  More cherry and rasp tart fruit flavors in the middle and end with a bitter stomach acid sourness in the end with some light rubber hints and prickly finish.  Crazy funky and off the wall lambic.

Growing cherry presence as it warms. Hard to decipher, the wild yeast brings up a cheesy and bready backing, but the main character might be the huge citrus backings: lemony, grapefruity. Elegant to the max. It unveils itself not as perfumey as the original Framboos at this point, but perhaps as vibrant, not as acidic, but more jammy and in its own way, almost as brilliant. Fleshy palate, pie-like, delicate in its character fullness. Champaigny body. Superb and to me easily one of the best new beers of the year.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4413,"2007-10-23",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2008 Bottle at Delirium Cafe, for a mere 25. Ouch. I was thinking Id be seeing this beer all over the country as it was just released, but after 4 days in Belgium and 4 bottle shops, this is the only time Ive seen it, so Im glad I jumped on it. Very lactic, milky and strong raspberry aroma. A touch of grass, good cherry, but the raspberry is compeltely and utterly dominant, more like one of the sweet ones. No head. Less milk in the palate. Raspberry is still strong, but there is not enough carbonation and the sourness is a bit lacking. Fruit is completely dominant all around but the base lambic is quite disappointing. I think this needs another couple years to sour up and for the raspberry to come into check. Ive got another bottle to bring home, so well see. 7/3/7/4/3.7

4413,"2007-10-05",3.9,"From ygtbsm94. First I need to say that I really like lambic and sour beer in general however the Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze is not on of my favorites. The house flavor on this beer is ""rubber for me and while its nice enough its not usually my bag of tricks. Despite this I have loved other Fonteinen beers like 50th Anniversary, which was definitely missing this ""rubber"" aspect.  But none the less I was extremely looking forward to trying this beer.Poured raspberry juice color, dark enough that you cannot see through it, yet the edges, all around, are a much lighter shade of pink. It has that signature aroma of rubber that the Oude Geuze has as well as an herbally barnyard funk.  All that is wrapped up in a thick sweet raspberry aroma that is not artificial or overly sweet at all.  Low on acidity and not all that sour but more oak and barnyard aspect.  Taste is very drying and herbally.  I am able to chew the rubber taste, which is followed by light sweet raspberries.  A lower carbonation adds to the chewy aspect of the beer.  Leaves a long very dry and [again] rubber aftertaste.  Very mellow on the sour. 750mL bottled on 02/07, Rodenbach Grand Cru tulip glass, again thanks Brad.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Aroma reminds me of a mellowed gueze.  Mildy sour and mild funk.  The raspberry flavor was good, and pleasantly different than other raspberry beers, because of the lower unfermented sugars.  Was expecting a punch in the face of flavor and sourness, but found a world class beer that is easy to drink.  Something that everyone would like connoiseurs to grandmas.

4413,"2007-09-29",4.1,"From a 750mL Bottle, Feb. 2007.  Generously shared by wetherel.  Thanks, John!  Pours a hazy, pinkish ruby color with a thin, even layer of creamy off-white head.  The body has a brilliant, pectin-like even consistency that practically glows with raspberry coloring.  Big fruity nose with a restrained, yet freshening acidity.  Loads of fresh raspberries that have a young, almost borderline under-ripe character thats complimented nicely by a dry, herbal raspberry seed character.  Didnt pick up much wood or excessive funk in the nose, but the berries were backed by an underlying acidity that suggested a squeeze of fresh lemon.  Light bodied with a spritzy carbonation, crisp acidity, and wonderfully dry mouthfeel.  Fresh raspberry flavors hop out on the tongue right away with a balancing dose of seedy bitterness.  A pleasant floral character emerges on the tongue with a cleansing sour acidity.  Didnt really pick up on the cherry characters, and the wood presence was also restrained, but the sour level was definitely on par with expectation.  A touch of solvent-like character crept up in the final smack, but didnt really detract.  Delicious.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Smells like a marriage of New Glarus Raspberry Tart and an excellent, traditional, highly acidic Belgian framboise. Mild, smoky, meaty phenols and a note of raw leather. The flavor offers restrained sweetness, mild, aged hop bitterness along with lovely, biting, funky acidity. Fruity raspberry and modest cherry. Yum!  Medium to full-bodied with a creamy, then abrasive mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Fruity, wonderfully tart, Mojave-dry finish.

Raspberry, lime, cherry pits, almond, oak, honey, some smokey notes even. Absolutely dry with a firm, but not outrageous sourness. Medium bodied. Raspberry, dust and cherry pits in the aftertaste. Great beer, but IMO not the very best 3F can offer.

4413,"2007-09-26",3.8,"Big thanks to MikeTD for this rare beer. Dark red pour and just a faint set of tiny bubles appear. Aroma is fresh ripe raspberries and cherries. Taste is dry with the essential gueze like dry funk taste. Cherry and raspberry rides along but does not blast you with sourness. Aftertaste has a lingering sharpness with more of the gueze like funk. Very hard to describe.","Brook Park, Ohio, USA","crizay"
4413,"2007-09-26",4.4,"2007. Hazy, deep pink with crimson and underlying violet hues, a dense coloration that is darker than anticipated and glows with a radiance only a bottle conditioned Belgian masterpiece could provide. Very low evident carbonation, just some oily residue and scattered bubbly clusters at the edge of the glass. This looks tame, but too enticing to hesitate. The aroma leads with fresh-crushed raspberry, a nose that is so initially complex its startling. Very jammy, with mild tartness and low noticeable acidity and little acetic tonation. Mild bread and a hectic and sprawling funk and spice blend are restrained by farmhouse notes that create yet another unique lambic scent array. A strange taco meat/meaty/fleshy nuance emerges, an off-the-wall expression of the overabundance of very little filtering and so much wild raspberry notes...incredibly distorted and awesomely unique. Light floral notes follow, with a low yeastiness for such a fresh bottle of lambic. Mild charcoal and ashen notes creep in at the end of each whiff and provide a fresh brand of mineralic congruence. Fruit notes surely mask much of the other components in the aroma, but never completely. This is just right so far, with an amazing twist on the typical(no insinuation that 3 Fonteinen is ever typical) and fabulous complexity that rings out with little effort on my part. The flavor discharges much more citrus variance, beyond raspberry, than the aroma. Additional notes of fresh green apples, underripe banana and puckering, pithy orange all fold in upon first sip. Shoe leather/sude tinges trickle in(an expansion of just the slightest note in the aroma). Grrenery and powdered sugar sneak up as well, with further warmth. More traditional lambic fruit notes emerge and round out the taste into something more recognizable and more challenging. Sweetness is medium, but a quick downslide to a light level happens shortly after each sip touches the tip of the tongue. Steady dryness comes quickly thereafter and is pleasing and quenching. Acidity is mild and bitterness is low but there are plenty of hints of flowery, aged hops throughout, possibly moreso than was intended or is typically to the traditional adherance of the style. The finish is of strong farmhouse flavors, hay and moderate funk, raspberry flesh and wild yeasts lingering. Light-medium in body, with low carbonation and a challenging palate that leaves particulate feelings stuck in the throat on the way down. Interesting and wonderfully drinkable, this will no doubt only get better. Multiple revisits are a sure bet, an increased enjoyment leading to an increased score a definite possibility. I love 3 Fonteinen. This beer is worthy of the tribute it is intended to signify, worthy of the man who made this blending heritage and brewery a world-class realization.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
4413,"2007-09-21",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2007 Beer one in the tasting to end all tastings.   Pours an elegant ruby red, slightly hazy, looks as if kilos of raspberries were gently coerced into relasing their souls.  Subdued carbonation, which adds to my introspection.  Aroma reveals raspberries, with supporting notes of almond, rose petals, must and earty, with an odd leather back note.  It is almost a sensory overload.    Flavor is extremely tart, with a mild fruit charecter.  Wow.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
4413,"2007-09-18",4.2,"Bottle, from the BSF at the GBBF. An unclear but shiny cherry red, rough off-white head that settles away quickly. First layer of aroma is heavily wool; lemon, dandelions and pepper follow, then a prickly dry earthiness. Its not until several sniffs in that the berries register. But then there they are, in a really interesting way. To my nose, its half the leather- tart underipe spring berries, half the noble rot berries of late season. Lovely mouthfiling lemon sourness, filled out with earth and leather. The raspberry character is here too, but a bit coy amid all the other flavors. There is a softness to the palate and a flavor that seems to suggest fruit, without actually being fruity. (If that makes any sense at all.) This is a delicously brash youngster. I cant help but wondering what a few years will do...","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

4413,"2007-09-10",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2008 A Mes rate: 75cl bottle at home with Sim.<brCloudy and dark blood red colour with a pinkish rim around the edges. The colour is typical 3 Fonteinen. Very fruity aroma with plenty of raspberry obviously but there is also strawberry and cherry and just a lick of  3F sourness. Its both earthy and fresh at the same time. Flavour is even more special. Wonderfully tart with amazing complex fruity sourness. So many different fruit flavours emerge it is hard to do it justice. Strong citric notes, lemon, orange, kiwi, lime, then completely flooded by strawberry, cherry and a punch of puckering raspberries. Its like eating a whole pack of Jolly Ranchers at once and it just keeps going and going right the way through to an amazingly lengthy finish. Beautiful sweetness of the likes rarely witnessed but held perfectly in balance by the sourness. I could go on for days. Palate is certainly one of the best I have experienced. On top of all this, it still feels young. 100% certainty to be a future classic.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Purple head quickly disappearing after pouring the bear. Good carbonation. Self-evident fruity aromas dominated by the cherries but after some time I also recognise the raspberries. Cherry is dominantly present at the start, but when the cherrys faint away, the raspberries pop up.

4413,"2007-08-17",4.7,"Shortlived dark pink head, fed by very good carbonation over deep red beer, varying from clear ruby over the colour of bloodorange juice to a muddier brownish red. Having rested the necessary months, here are the raspberries - superb!  Theres an additional fruity smell, that was in the beginning clearly cherry. Little perfumey, but in the best way possible. Very perfumey flavours as well, a jumble of raspberry, cherry, lemon, sour apples, a tutti frutti of the best quality. Finish is still mainly sour cherries, very ripe. Aggressive acidity, the lactic, fruitacids and the carbonation confluent. Still, there is that much fruit, that no one could call this light. I did not believe the Master when I told him, after the first tasting, that I found too much cherry, he told me it would better with aging. Now the drinking accompanies humble pie - Armand was right.

Aroma is super rasberry, like as soon as the bottl opened the rasberry filled the air, hint at tart berry fruit, very slight funky nuttyness. Taste is just outstanding, theres soo much berry fruit in here it could almost be fruit juice, the tartness off the rasberry, the dryness off the lambic base, i had the entire 750 to myself in about 20 mins, theres poissibly never been such a drinkable ale. Carbonation is very fine and gives it a great appearance. An experiance an one i want again asap! RERATE: Same score. Gee this has developed, the sourness has totally kicked in, the sweetness is not all gone but its alot sourer than what it was.  Tart pluckering, very drinkable. The cherrys are noteable now too and the rasberry is tammed down somewhat. Its sharp and cleanses the mouth well. Carbonation doesnt seem as excessive but still ads an edge to it.

4413,"2007-08-08",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2008 New batch @ GBBF, the sole reason I attended.The epitome of framboise, a bit young as far as lambics go but none the less amazing still. Hazy reddish-orange with a thin pink head. Fantastic sour raspberry and lambic nose. Very tasty with lots of real raspberry flavour, well balanced sweet and sour ratio (for me anyway as I prefer sour)  Dry and quite fizzy with a looooong finish. Cant wait till it gains some age and due to my lack of patience its a good thing I brought 2 bottles home.
Its about time I re-vamped this rate, theres so much more to this than I noted in my drunken GBBF stupor. Pours an opaque blood red, slightly orange around the edges where the light penetrates. The nose is sherbert raspberries, juicy cherries and strawberries with yeast and hay notes. Taste is yeasty and tart with so many fruit flavours, all the berries aforementioned and also, lime, kiwi and lemon. I can liken it to several things, raspberry lemonade, sour cherry candy and berry sorbet just to name a few. The finish is dry, so long and tasty you just want to smack your mouth and enjoy for a while. Even though it had only been a couple of months there was definitely some change, its gonna be really interesting to see what some real age may yield.
