1657,"2012-02-12",3.1,"On nitro at Russian River. Deep cola ruby pour looking black in the nonic pint. Nitrogen provides a thick, Guinness cream foam with huge retention and sheets of nitro lace. Nose is essentially absent as expected in style. Perhaps twang of lemon and acidic coffee. Taste is quite hoppy for style with lemon tea up front and bitter cocoa powder in the back end. Watery body as expected for gravity. Nicely sessionable though not a big step up from Guinness and certainly not as good as the Aud Blonde so....why bother?

It looks great, with a thick, solid dark body and a very thick, rich tan head that lasts and leaves excellent and exceedingly rich lacing.  It starts nice and roasty, with a good stout chocolate-coffee element and fairly full flavour, but then it briefly becomes a little weak and watery (not uncommon in dry stouts, but hardly necessary), before leaving a mixed finish.  On one hand, the finish is a little sweet and has the nice toasty, smokey element of a good stout, but this unfotrunately becomes just a little too harsh, with a faint burnt skunky taste.  This is sitll a very good stout since the skunkiness is not strong enough to ruin it by any means, but it is just strong enough to detract a bit. I get this occasionally, but not often, especially since two blocks away, Third Street Aleworks usually has a better tasting, if less aesthetically pleasing, dry stout on tap.","California, USA","Wulfstan"

1657,"2007-06-20",4.0,"On tap at the brewery; nitrogenated.  Pours a dark creamy, blackish brown color with a thin layer of nitrogenated beige head.  Aroma is a clean, smooth, subdued amalgam of arabian mocha coffee, toasted almonds,  and frothy cream.  It smells inviting, but restrained by the shackles of collapsing nitrogen.  Ill just go ahead and skip the description of the mouthfeel, simply because while not disappointing, N2 is the only fitting descriptor for that experience.  The light, yet complex, flavor profile is astounding.  Dark belgian chocolate, earthy sumatran coffee, and toasted pine nuts flood the tongue with an amazing amount of flavor for the inexpensive price of ABV.  Roasty, nutty, malty, yet light and easy drinking; pairs excellent with the smoked salmon foccacia on the menu, especially considering the lightness of the body makes it refreshing as well.  The black board lists this as having 46 IBUs, which I expected to be overwhelming for a beer of this magnitude, but its quite the contrary.  Supplementary is a much better word - the bitterness of the hops carries a rich minty, earthy flavor on the backend that disguises itself perfectly in between the roasty bitterness of the malts, leaving behind a non-herbal smack of palate cleansing, dry stout goodness.

One of the nicer stouts that I’ve had recently.","Orange, California, USA","Heatwaves"
1657,"2005-06-03",3.3,"Heavy roasted aroma, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, caramel.  Why Nitro though, it kills beers?  Smooth, and nice dry stout.  Much better then anything that you can find at Vons.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
1657,"2005-05-28",3.5,"On tap @ brewery.  Nice dark body with a creamy tan head.  Fair lacing in rings and other loopy shapes.  Weak aroma.  Smelled of dough, musky and earthy, lightly roasted.  Flavor was similar, if a bit sour and not terribly pleasing for a stout.  Some coffee, nutty character, but not much.  Mouth was pleasant and dry, light creamy carbonation.  A dry stout like Murphys but not as harsh and more agreeable.  Easy drinking.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"
1657,"2004-08-19",3.7,"tasted in santa rosa. quite a nutty, creamy aroma reminded me a little of kahlua. pretty dark, coffeeish, sweet, quite dry, nice stuff","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
1657,"2004-07-19",3.5,"Deep brown.  Creamy light brown head.  Light coffee nose, light creamy  nose overall, with a regular burnt coffee and milk chocolate flavors.  Decent.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1657,"2004-06-20",3.7,"Tasted at the 2004 Pizza Port Real Ale Festival. Eclipse black color. Small head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. Slightly sweet. A medium bodied dry stout. Malts are chocolate and sweet. Slightly spicy hops. Nicely balanced. Very smooth. Nicely roasty and toasty. Small soft and round carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1657,"2004-06-15",3.9,"This beer was sampled at the San Diego Real Ale Festival 2004 on cask. This beer poured a fairly viscous dark brown color with hints of black and a thin sheath of orangy/tan lacing which lasted roughly 2 minutes. The aroma was very stout-like......cocoa, coffee and a milky vanilla in the nose. The taste is much the same. Very milky chocolateyness in mid-taste which sets it apart from most stouts. Grainy chocolates in the finish, fairly dry and long-lasting. Some hint of hops in the finish, overall a well rounded stout. Vinnie knows how to make a damn good brew!","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
1657,"2004-06-15",4.4,"Cask @ Real Ale Fest
The beer pulls from the cask an onyx color the head thick and tall, the color chocolate brown, the texture creamy with the lace a glutinous sheet to cling mightily to the glass. Nose was sweet chocolate; coffee with a rich toasted grain aroma to end it all, start was ambrosia, rich in malt and the top full and creamy. Finish was gentle in it acidity, the hops perfection, somewhat bittersweet and dry aftertaste, I voted this the hit of the fest at least for me, and just missed by a frog hair of getting some at OBriens, damn well better luck next time.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1657,"2004-06-13",3.7,"Dirty cream head with a pitch black body.  Cream, hazelnut, tons of roasted malts and a touch of flowers in the nose.  Smooth rounded flavor with robust coco and coffee notes with just enoughf room for a hint of Bailies.  Dryer mouthfeel then the nose would imply finnishing with more coffee.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
1657,"2004-06-12",3.8,"cask at the real ale fest at pizza port. light flavor and body, slight lactic tones, a nice drinking stout","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
1657,"2004-05-31",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2004 (Cask draft: O'Brien's in San Diego, CA) A stout with a lighter flavor and body than many in the category, and a slight sweetness; Moderately strong dark roasted malt flavor is more toasted than roasted, and the bitterness is fairly mild as well; Somewhat smooth and creamy mouthfeel; The palate is medium bodied and, as expected from the cask, low in carbonation; There is an alcoholic, perhaps a bourbon nose, slightly sweet, very nice; Jet black in color and fully opaque; As the light brown bubbly head settles, it clumps together like curdled milk, very interesting looking, but not a negative characteristic in my opinion; Not much lacing(Draft: Russian River Brewing Co. in Santa Rosa, CA) Second tasting at Vinnie's brewpub was on nitro, but not cask like at O'Brien's, and the result was a drier, somewhat standard Irish stout, though still on the thin side in body","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

1657,"2004-05-29",4.2,"Had on cask at Obriens...This stout pours with a black body topped by a thick, tan head with a good amount of lacing.  The aroma is slightly sweet and malty with a nice roasty note and notes of coffee with a touch of chocolate.  The flavor is great.  Its sweet yet slightly bitter and malty with a nice mocha note and a slight roastiness.  Very smooth, creamy and full bodied.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"
1657,"2004-05-29",2.9,"Had on cask at obriens.... pours a deep brown with an off-white head that didnt last, probably due to the cask.  The flavors seemed watered down with little flavor.  Slight bitter dark chocoalte flavors, but nothing memorable.  I will have to try it again, hopefully not on cask.","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
