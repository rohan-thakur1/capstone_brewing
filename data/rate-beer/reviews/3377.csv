3377,"2017-03-22",2.5,"tap @ tap & bottle: woah, I was looking forward to tasting this one, given that I like that style and a top50 is most often an indicator of good quality. However, the Ponto really doesnt agree with my palate at all. The nose is a lovely mix of many US, NZ and EU hops which clearly indicates that this is an IPA or even an IIPA in hop-character. The taste is where it breaks down for me, there is a sharp bitterness which I usually associate with hop pellet chewing. This taste goes over into an aftertaste of metallic and mineralic with even more hop pellet character. Seeing as I have this problem with quite a few of the NE-style IPAs it could just be my palate or something went slightly wrong with the process here. Definitely not my kind of thing.","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","derA"

3377,"2016-08-10",4.2,"De la ya muy conocida micro cervecería Pizza Port(U.S.A) esta session IPA Ponto, esta cervecería fue una de las iniciadoras del movimiento craftbeer, fue fundada en 1987, actualmente California es la capital de la cerveza artesanal y esta cerveceria es ya un emblema reconocido a nivel mundial, esta Ponto es la versión Session de una I.P.A tradicional, es por eso que se leen las siglas S.I.P.A abajo del nombre de la cerveza, una Session IPA a grandes rasgos es una IPA de baja intensidad en alcohol (menos de 5.5% ABV), amargor y cuerpo pero manteniendo las características aromáticas de los lúpulos e impresión visual, en especifico esta Session IPA contiene 4.5% ABV.
En aspecto tiene una cabeza de espuma amplia de perlas chicas y medianas de color cristalino, una excelente retención como normalmente debe ser en una IPA común ,en todo momento presente la capa protectora de espuma, el color es un amarillo turbio pajizo con destellos amarillos mas obscuros, en las paredes del vaso se puede observar un cuerpo ligeramente mediano.
En aroma es una conjunción de notas frutales y algo cítricas con un dulzor discreto que aparenta una muy jovial convivencia con los lúpulos americanos que contiene, los aromas mas perceptibles son a mango, toronja, ligeras notas a piña, maracuyá, cascara de naranja, ligero olor a dulzor de malta solo como respaldo a las propiedades del lúpulo.
En sabor no es una IPA tan agresiva, si tiene una ligera cantidad de dulzor proveniente del grano que le da una buena base pero tampoco son tan marcados puesto que el amargor es menor que al de las IPAs americanas y reluzcan los sabores a toronja, piña, mango, ligera resinosidad, el dryhop no deja tanto rastro en las mejillas y se siente una textura mucho mas liviana a comparación de su icónica Swamis o de la mayoría de las American IPA, tiene un final seco que alenta el consumo rápido y un retrogusto mediano que no es tan pasajero de carácter cítrico.","MEXICO","Yased"

A little pungent, abrasive, but still not as off-putting as it sounds on paper.

Ok, this brew does deliver what is promised. Larger hop flavor with some balance and sessionable for sure. But why spend the money on a lighter version of a standard IPA? Ok... Anyhow, lightly resinous upfront followed by floral hops with hints of grassy hops. Bitterness lingers slightly with a hints of resin toward back end as well. Very weak doughy malt to try and help with balance. Body is on the thin side. 
Yes it is what the brewer advertised. And I love how much how flavor is here for a low ABV brew, but If I pay for an IPA at a normal craft beer cost, I would like a bit more bang for my buck. I guess I think this is a stupid marketing strategy as opposed to a quality style that will stand the test of time. Glad Craig gave me a can too try but this style is silly to me.
