2421,"2016-07-17",4.4,"2010 version and a big thanks to Duffman for this! Had it at the RBSG Pgh 2016 grand tasting. So beautiful in the mild fruity perfume aroma, makes me think of sex and this girl has legs too boot, right up to her ass. First taste is oh so good and gracious, so civilized with its sweet waxy feel. So strong too, I havent had many iced ciders (and this is a perry) but it seems to bring more heat than Im used to. Mouthfeel is so smooth and civilized, yummy! Makes me all happy inside. Great stuff! this stuff ROCKS! Thanks duff!","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

2421,"2016-06-21",4.1,"Bottle shared with Jao. Crystal clear deep golden copper color. Aroma is very rich, jammy, apple butter, pear character is pretty light, could easily be mistaken for an ice cider. Taste is sweet, rich, decadent caramelized sugars, maple butter, very low acidity, perhaps the main difference with an ice cider. Palate is rich and mouthcoating. Delicious, very good value as well.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

2421,"2015-08-06",3.8,"Vintage 2011. Cuivrée est sa couleur. De courtes jambes sont observées. Au nez, alcool floral et épicé légèrement trop bavard et poires confites, caramélisées, mielleuses avec des pommes vertes concentrées, très odorantes. Tout ça est bien appétissant malgré la sensation «éthylique». Au goût, un boisé imbibé de cannelle ou dune épice du même acabit avec des poires et des pommes chargées par les sucres, des fleurs caramélisées, de lalcool et possiblement dautres fruits du verger en compote. Corps bien collant et liquoreux. Finale assez douce avec une pointe dacidité qui se réchauffe. Très bon.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

2421,"2015-07-16",3.8,"Bottle @ 4th of July. Smuggled this back from Montreal, vintage 2012. Rich amber color. Huge maple syrup and apple pie filling on the nose. Some pear tart, a touch of acidity, and a whole lot of brown sugar. Theres a slight spice note on the tongue as well as a very mild almost tannin. Acidity is on the mild side, which makes this come off as very sweet, even for an ice perry. Still, quite enjoyable.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2421,"2014-12-25",4.0,"Bottle (200 ml). Harvest 2011. From and shared with my brother. Thanks!

Appearance: Deep amber with little alcohol legs. 

Aroma: Honey/floral presence, pears, green apples notes, light spiciness and hints of alcohol.

Taste: Moderately sweet with a nice acidic presence, honey/floral notes, pears, light green apples, lighs spiciness and a touch of alcohol.

Palate: Full bodied. Still. Sirupy and liquorous mouthfeel. Warming alcohol/spices finish. 

Overall: One of my first Ice Perry and I liked it a lot. Theres many similarities with Ice Cider, but its (at least this one) a lot more floral and the pears arent showcased as much as the apples in Ice Cider. Delicious sipper. I will definitely buy some more Ice Perry in a near future.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2421,"2013-05-03",4.1,"Édition 2010.
Doré et limpide, une robe veloutée et liquoreuse glisse sur les parois du verre lorsquon remue le tout. Des arômes de poires, forcément, en émanent, accompagnées deffluves florales et herbeuses, presque médicinales. Un goût, qui encore-là, tourne autour de la poire. Cest légèrement acidulé et ça picote lintérieur des joues. On perçoit le côté mûr du fruit, dévoilant ainsi toutes les saveurs de sa palette; sucré et suret sur la langue.

Lots of vanilla notes and a soft tannic component as well that adds a little but of rustic earthiness.  Honeyed fruit with a surprisingly bright acidity.  Lots of pineapple and other stewed tropical fruits as well.  Flavour has a little bit of peppery heat.  Very complex cider.  Warming brings up a little bit of light berryish character.

2421,"2010-08-09",4.2,"Bottle, shared by JoeMcPhee.  Pours a clear deep honey gold body, rather viscous and clingy on the glass leaving thick heavy legs.  The nose is sweet and decadent, not all that far off from the few ice ciders that Ive had.  Deep honey and sugary notes with some caramelized pears, floral notes, and some slight wood notes.  The flavor is sweet and bursting with honey and concentrated fruit.  Some light wood, a touch of alcohol, lots of fruit skins, and some light tannins.  Slightly sticky and mouth coating, this just feels awesome on the tongue.  Minimal alcohol apparency.  Delicious!","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

2421,"2010-04-17",4.3,"I shared this bottle the last day of RBWG 2010 with Dan, Ryan, Jon, and Eric, and maybe Larry?  Wow- this stuff is crazy good.  375 ml corked bottle like an ice cider.  Pours a very deep honey coppery golden - very viscous and shows very nice legs in the glass.  Aroma is actually more skewed to an ice cider- very apple cider like, with tons of honey sweetness, some floral notes, and of course some nice caramelized and fresh pears, gets slight green apples as well, but moslty very sweet with slight tropical fruity notes as well.  Flavor is viscous and sweet- honey, and lyles syrup-like, slight herbal notes with pear skins, very viscous- about the same as la face cachee inspiration.  Pear mango and apple dominate the flavors as it warms and even gets some pineapple- over ripe very dark pineapple, slight tannin and astringency with the green skin gives it some nice slight bitter astringency and tartness to round out the very thick sweet body.  Very viscous body, coats mouth tongue, throat and even gives that waxyiness on the teeth which is kinda cool I guess- flavor and body lingers for a longtime- very long aftertaste.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2421,"2010-04-07",4.3,"Bottle shared by Paul or Dan right before leaving RBWG.  Pours a pale golden body with a still head.
