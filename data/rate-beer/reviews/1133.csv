Excuses aangenomen. Deze afgehaald bij mijnbierdoos.be op 18/11/2016. En geproefd op 21-01-2017. Rodenbach Caractere Rouge / 2013 is een rood-bruin (EBC 65) en helder biertje. Het schuim heeft een licht roze kleur en bij het uitschenken krijg je een normale hoeveelheid van, het vormt een gelijkmatige laag op het bier maar slaat zeer vlug neer, het gaat snel bijna helemaal weg, er blijft slechts een ietsie pietsie van over. Ook een normale wandkleving genoteerd. Rodenbach Caractere Rouge / 2013 heeft een zoet en fruitig aroma, ik moet denken aan framboos en natuurlijk krieken. Dit aroma wordt na een tijdje steeds sterker. De smaak is zuur, en licht zoetig, ook de frambozen en de krieken zitter erbij. Kwa mondgevoel geeft Rodenbach Caractere Rouge / 2013 een volle smaak, is hij wat bitterdroog, volmondig van textuur en komt hij wat prikkelend over (misschien door het zure?). Alles tesamen is Rodenbach Caractere Rouge / 2013 een harmonieus biertje te noemen ondanks dat het zure het zoete wat overheerst. De nasmaak vloeit wat uit en is zoetig, zuur en lichtjes droog, de krieken en nu ook de veenbessen zitten er in. Rodenbach Caractere Rouge / 2013 is niet slecht, maar hij zou toch wat zoeter mogen zijn. Ik denk wel dat hij heel ideaal is om er gerechten mee te bereiden.","Dendermonde, BELGIUM","RudiGR"

Rather active carbonation, body medium, finish woody dry and somewhat sticky. Pretty good but kinda confusing considering its average score is above 4, and it being no 5 in the Sour Red/Brown category.

1133,"2016-10-04",3.9,"75cl bottle at home (25 IX 2016), shared with friends. This is the 2013 

edition, as the other batches since 2011 a degustation beer created by Brouwerij Rodenbach/Palm and food chef Viki Geunes. The maceration of fruit is an important, wine-derived treatment, used in this Rodenbach process for six months for different berries: sour cherries (five percent), cranberries (four percent), raspberries (four percent). This juice is blended with a two-year oak aged sour red ale, a wine-like specialty brew. With a scarlet red, red-orange or fluorescent red coloured brew with dark body, it lacks the impeccable head - a white foamed, pinkish gloomed collar - for having the perfect fruit beer look. The nose already comes with a sour aroma, backed with several wood, almost oak notes. Within the flavours, one can easily spot the red ripe raspberrie and red currant features. The mouthfeel is beautifully soft - could this be the maceration, or is this just imagination - with a tasteful medium carbonation, added to the acidic and fruity start. The body is more raspberry and some juniper even. The oak foeder ensures a creamy, lingering vanilla base, altough the body is not that firm in the whole. The malt features have a corn backbone, without tasting awkward nor unpleasant. The sourness is surprisingly soft, except for the raspberry mouthfeel. There is a sugary sweetness on the background, supported by sweets and leaves sensations. In the taste perception there are even hints of oranges, mandarin oranges and even some peaches. The wood features come with a keen dryness, adding to the warm red wine, bourgogne or Saint-Emilion character. This sour red wine body is not that powerfull to the very end. How to conclude this lovely brew? The macerated sweet-sour red fruits and the foeder base make up for a fine, gastronomic match. The almost perfect looks and an equally vinous nose ensure an elegant brew with a mostly firm, yet velvet mouth, making a complex old brown, with a somewhat swift finish. A Flemish classic in a wine treatment version, successful for sure.","Waarschoot, BELGIUM","Hamirubi"

Interesting, and no flaws or alcohol, but like many of their beers lately, it seems like they are designed to actually blossom with age, as theyre just too rich, compact and overly fruity when fresh/relatively fresh.Tart, not terribly sour, with tons of varied red fruits and surprisingly more cranberry than expected. Some grape character mixes in and there is a fair amount of oak tannin, light caramel malt and tight carbonation creating a substantial body. Malic and acetic acids tickle and then pucker the mouth on the finish with cranberry and cherry lingering. Would like to revisit in about 2-4 years.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. The fruit works so great and is extremely noticeable in both the aroma and flavour.

Sweet vinous aroma with luscious fruit, acetic acid and a strong barrel presence. Decent amount of oak but not overpowering with delicate char. No toothpick character which is surprising given it aged in oak for two years. Strong acetic acid but more of a vinaigrette sweetness, not harsh or solvent-like. Lots of luscious fruit juice. The cranberry and sour cherries really stand out countering the acid and barrel with a really pleasant juicy fruit presence. Smells incredible. 

Tart and puckering with the perfect balance of sour acidity, earthy oak and vinous fruit sweetness. Subtle funk and acetic acid but again, it not solvent-like, providing mostly vinegary sweetness. Some dark malt flavors in there along with prominent vinous dark fruit. Tart cranberry and sour cherry really stand out along with other dark berries. Well balanced and surprisingly drinkable considering the complexity and sour acidity.

Smaken är väldigt god, gurglade runt i munnen, först kom syran, sen sötman, sen syran igen som avslutades med att beskriva det som rödvinstanniner som drar ihop käften, den blir dock aldrig så sur som andra jag provat, men sötman balanserar upp surheten så magiskt att det är sjukt!

The flavor profile is World Class and serves as the standard against which others should be judged. It is intense, quite complex and a brewers masterpiece of balance. It begins with a burst of tart fruit, raspberries and cherries, over a slightly sweet background. In the middle, tartness gives a slight pucker with only the slightest hint of sour vinegar. The raspberry and cherry fruit flavors slowly subside and cranberry comes to the forefront over a caramel like sweetness.

It tastes like raspberries, cherries (both sweet and tart ones), cranberries, oak, grape skins, caramel, vinegar and a bit of apple and lemon peel.

A generous person opened this at a tasting. While expensive I would certainly not hesitate to pick up another if I had the room in the cellar. A different take on Grand Cru and other Rodenbach releases, this accessible special release fits any special occasion.

Aroma / Appearance - A bright red base with vibrant head looks blood red with a thick light absorbing presence. Musty cherries, hay, straw, and cranberries give this a texture which is part Rodenbach Grand Cru and part earthy saison. How it works I dont know but I could savor it for a long time.

Flavor / Palate - Cherries and bright fruits shine from the first sip. A sweet transition is akin to Grand Cru but with more fruitiness and complexity. The cranberry finish brings to mind some of New Glarus offerings if they were transported to Europe. Thanks to the person who generously shared this world class release.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Had the pleasure of sharing this with a few good friends to celebrate our 30th birthdays. The night prior we indulged in a couple of rather good (and expensive!) bottles of wine; so the standard was set high.
Presents a hazy, amber body, stained red with a small, slightly pink tinged head.
Wow, this smells amazing! Red berries explode from the glass - ripe raspberry, sour cherry, some vinous almost Pinot-like character about it bolstered by a kiss of toasty oak, burnt caramel, some musty old wood and that ubiquitous browned pineapple Brett funk character.
Its a smooth ride on the palate, at least at first - a generous body to it, silky, leading with an unsurpassed elegance into a sourness thats somewhere between sour cherry & a fine aged Balsamic.
Sensory overload of red fruits on the palate - concentrated, luscious, fresh yet stewed yet not, and drizzled in a sticky balsamic reduction, with a bit of woody, barnyard funk. Sits on the palate, lingering, brooding, begging - its so easy to drink!
Phenomenal stuff! Something really special, worthy of a great occasion.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

1133,"2014-10-03",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2017 Luxury product developed in collaboration with Michelin-starred chef Vicki Geunes; the original batch (2011) consisted of only 900 bottles and my rating is about one of those only. This beer consist of a specific unblended Rodenbach Foederbier with sour cherries, raspberries and cranberries dissolved in it, after which the bottles are laid to rest for half a year before being put onto the market. Pale off-pinkish head, medium thick but stable, colour a deep dark copper with warm ochre hue and calm sparkling. Powerful, utterly fruity and estery aroma, in which the Rodenbach complexity is beautifully mingled with the typical aromas of the respective fruits; impressions of vanilla and tannins, old sherry, honey, passion fruit, mango, yoghurt, passion fruit, port wine, wine vinegar... Taste equally complex and fruity, soft sourish with velvety mouthfeel, vinous, sharpish carbo at first but calming down towards the finish, soft sweetness of raspberries, fruit tartness of the sour cherries and spicy sweetness of the cranberries all noticeable and cleverly positioned against each other, caramelly touch, oak, tart, lemony acid hint in the finish, dry, complex and long, thirst-quenching and with low bitterness as is typical for an oud bruin. This must be one of the best examples of this particular style I ever had and certainly the best Rodenbach - at least that first, limited batch, as the more recent vintages seem to have become somewhat less tart, less complex and a bit sweeter.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
1133,"2014-09-29",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 10-21-13-

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass 

 Appearance  The beer pours a lightly hazed reddish-brownish color with a rather thick and billowy pink tinted head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading and leaving some nice levels of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is biggest of sweeter red fruit smells, with lots of raspberry, cherry and cranberry. While some of the aroma is sweet, there is also a good level of funk, oak, a bit of grass, and a rather potent sour vinegar smell creating a nice fruity tart smell for the brew.

 Taste  While there is a sweetness in the nose, there is not so much in the taste. There is a little bit upfront with some lightly sweetened blackberry, cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors. While a little sweet is there, the flavor is largely of a quite tart cranberry flavor. A rather funky and lightly yeasty flavor is present as well along with a rather apple cider vinegar taste. As the flavor advances the sweeter flavors fade while some oak and a bit of vanilla join the tongue. The tart flavors get even stronger more toward the end with the tart cranberry fruit flavor really taking control of the fruit flavors. In the end, with all the tart cranberry coming to the tongue and a bit of a woody and grassy taste joining the flavor, a dry, funky, somewhat unbalanced, and quite tart cranberry flavor is left to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner and lighter side with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. The lighter body and higher carbonation were quite appropriate for the style, helping keep the sour and fruity flavors of the brew from becoming too overwhelming and keeping it overall more drinkable.

 Overall  It was OK, but I wasnt too fond of this one actually (at least in comparison the original Rodenbach). This was just a little too on the sour red fruit side for me. An interesting try, and if you are looking for a rather sour cranberry flavored beer then this is definitely one to go too.","","Darkmagus82"

1133,"2014-03-04",4.0,"Tasted along side Rodenbach, Rodenbach Grand Cru, and Rodenbach Vintage 2011. Crazy interesting beer that changed dramatically over the course of several hours as it warmed and opened up. The beer started very fruity in both aroma and flavor. The beer had very dominating notes of sweet cranberry and to a lesser extent raspberry. At first this was disappointing as the tartness was mild and overwhelmed by the sweet fruit. It was easily the least interesting beer beteween it, Grand Cru, and Vintage. However, as time went on, Rouge changed greatly. The fruit integrated with more cleanly into the beer. Sweetness mellowed. Tart sour fruit notes emerged. Wood and spice and even some fun earth notes presented themselves. All it a tight sliky package. Most impressive.

Dont explicitly get cranberry, but theres a huge berry jam & juicy presence all around, lending both sweetness & sourness. Taste is the same way, sour at first, then flowing into a delicate, finishing sweetness. Sour cherry, raspberry jam, & lemon flesh overload. I finally get some notable cranberry in the mouth coating finish. Slightly vinous at times with an even more robust oak & vanillin presence on the palate. Candy-like aftertaste with a timid kiss of acidity & sweetness. Sharp & carbonated well... Wow, this beer is great.

Aroma is lightly smoky and band aid/medicinal phenols, cranberries, faint acetic notes, tart raspberry, cherry, and strawberry aromas, light earthy cereal malt, imperceptible hops, and some cellar/dust notes underneath. The phenols and berries really dominate the aroma, though swirling opens up the berries a good bit. Flavor is lightly biting and acetic berries (cranberry, raspberry, cherry, strawberry), light peppery phenols, not much of the medicinal/band aid aroma enters the flavor. The earthy cereal malt flavor sits behind the berries and provides support, there is no hop flavor and only the mildest of bitterness which seems more acetic/tart than bitter.

This might have been the reason I wasnt completely blown away by it. My bottle was filtered and pasturised which stripped the depth of flavour and aroma. Both the flavour and aroma where on the sweeter side of sour. The sugar is certainly more dominant than the refreshing sour aspect. Plus with the lack of alive yeast to eat those sugars its not going to change the sweetness with age.

Cherries, red cranberries and raspberries take on flowers and bubblegum in this delightfully tart and bubbly brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy red.
-A spiciness is also present, redolent of cinnamon and cardamom at times. Must be the sour cherries doing.
-The aroma is truly compelling.
-The fruitiness is exuberant but never boring.
-All flavors are well rendered and polished.

Aroma is piercing raspberries up front and some of the classic acetic Rodenbach character comes through as well. Taste is similar, immediate raspberry flavor followed by a more pronounced flemish red profile. Get some oakiness as the beer lingers on my tongue. Palate is average, somewhat nondescript. Finish brings more intense acetic sourness and a little caramel to support that.

I do have the feeling it was a bit young but here we go anyways:
A 75cl bottle served in both a Chouffe glass and an old Belle-Vue Gueuze glass just for me.  :)
Medium to smaller sized, lively and quickly changing vanilla pink ish colored foamy head. Leaves some bubbles/very small islands on top of a light hazy amber red colored beer.
Aroma has loads of red fruit, strawberry, cherries, raspberry, cranberry, oak, hint of yeast, light vinous, crispy, hints of grainy malts and corn.
Flavours of first very red fruity, than yeasty and than more sour: yeast, caramel, oak, brown sugars, cherry, cranberry, bitter, more sour, wood hints of grains, light spiced and malts.
Aftertaste has a yeasty wood ish undertone with some fruit tones, sourness, malts and citric herbs.
Crisp and clean sourness.
Low carbo, sprinkly first than right away a creamy mouthfeel, medium to lightly fuller body and a creamy texture.
I think as I mentioned before that this beer is still a bit young, but after letting it breath for about an hour the beer becomes more balanced but still not optimal. A stronger sour touch which start fruity and ends sour that it seems to make the body a bit unbalanced and not thin but a bit thinner...

But now I had the second batch again, but with some maturation, it improved a lot in taste and the sourness came in great again.
So little advice for everybody buying this beer, keep it cellared for one year, maybe little more, and the beer will be a lot better!","Gent, BELGIUM","PriorL"

1133,"2012-12-31",3.3,"A steady pour into my Bruery tulip produces a two finger thick, pale pink tinged, pale tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated red color, not unlike a dark cherry; when held up to the light the beer shows a light haze, and a bright red hue. The beer has a touch of a childrens aspirin type fruitiness to it, perhaps even a bit like fake Concord Grape, but really the bright, lush raspberry character is the dominant note to the aroma. I believe the cranberry character is noticeable here, towards the end it smells like sweet cranberry juice a bit, the cherry plays a supporting role to the raspberries helping to give them more of a rounded, berry like character.

The beer starts out a little dry up front, but picks up a sweetness pretty quickly which lingers on the palate through to the finish where the acidity finally dries things out again. Not as sweet as I was expecting, Alexander was sweeter, but it certainly could be quite a bit drier as well. The sweetness accentuates the fruit character, once again raspberries are prominent, but the cherries are much more noticeable in the flavor, including a bright, flavorful cherry skin character, while I dont specifically recognize the cranberry notes. There is lots of acidity here, the cranberries definitely contribute to this, as do the cherries and raspberries, the base beer contributes most of the acidity though, with a lactic acidity providing a rounded note and a hint of acetic character providing some additional bite. The beer definitely has a childrens aspirin flavor to it, especially in the finish at times, and this also seems a bit chalky in the texture at times. The beer is fairly light bodied, it definitely has some heft to it, but somehow the fruit character makes it seem lighter than it might otherwise be. The oak is light, but provides some firmness to both the flavor and the texture, though it is not overtly noticeable.

This is definitely a fruit focused beer, not nearly as cloying as the New Glarus Fruit beers, and not as fruit rich as some traditional Lambics. I wish that more of the base beer came through, the rich caramelized maltiness, and the firmness of the base beer is certainly missed here with this fruit focus. Still note a bad beer in the end, just one that has much more potential.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I know this is a beer for sharing, but I said to myself: my friend and Ratebeer admin Yngwie deserves a great beer for his honorary rating, celebrating his rating no. 10, 000 in absence since I cant join the party tonight in Kristiansand. Oh well, this ones for you Yngvar! :-) Pours a clear, deep ruby-hued body with a small pink-ish head. Lovely color. Nose is vinegar and acetone-like notes up front, followed by a lovely deep cascade of berries; all three kinds surfacing gently, dancing around in my nostrils. Nice. Hints of wood and caramel malt sweetness far in the back, but lacto-bacterial tartness and berries dominate for the most. Taste is finely tuned sweet berry notes at first, followed by really tart vinegar and acetone tones; then woody malt tones before a crisp, sweet-sour finish rounds the party off with style. The berries hang around in the aftertaste with a healthy dose of sourness, beckoning another sip. Palate is kind of fizzy but not really disturbing since it propels the taste in a rather enjoyable fashion. All in all a very fruity and lovely berry-focused sour ale.

1133,"2012-07-24",4.4,"75cl (corked and caged) bottle poured into long-stemmed wine glass
Vintage: Batch 1, 2011 (I think). Enjoyed at DHvL in early June 2012. Somewhat unfair to drink/rate this immediately following the Alexander, but thats how it goes. Pours medium amber. Half (off-white) fingernail head on medium pour. Smells sour, tart cherry/cranberry, and some funk/must. Oak and raspberry sweetness. Classic Rodenbach nose that is very inviting and rich. Taste includes bold sourness up-front with cherry and oak. Vinegar overtones along with tannins/leather as well as raspberry and cranberry punch (soft sweetness)! At times, the acidity was somewhat overpowering (I think it will age extremely well), but all in all a tasty beer. Overall a very good beer, but it needs some time to age/mellow a bit (so the tart acidity can work itself out). I think the long-term potential for this beer to be wonderful is very high. Ill be curious to see how Batch 2 (approx. 10k bottle production) drinks compared to this (Batch 1, 900 bottles).","5280, Colorado, USA","spdyfire83"

Aroma of cherries, cranberries and other red fruits. A touch of wood.

1133,"2012-07-15",4.2,"750 ml bottle - pours a cloudy cherry kinf of red with fine bublly pikish white head. Aroma of raspberry, violet flower, cassis, cherry vinegar and almond and almond paste/frangipane (when warmed up). Light to medium body with a fresh sour sweetness, taste is cherries. Ideal drinking temperature is cellar temperature. Nice beer, but I dsoubt that all fruit is natural; there is a tad sweetness that is akward. But overall a very nice beer","Linden, BELGIUM","gEUS"
1133,"2012-07-11",4.7,"An absolutely astonishing and suprising beer. Not at all what I expected from the Rodenbach name. This beer has elements of Rodenbach but also is very much like a fruit lambic. Nose is strong with the typical Rodenbach character and a touch of cherry and cranberry. It isnt until you taste the beer that its full power becomes apparent. Quite acidic but extremely well balanced. More like an american sour than the typical flemish red it has far less of the vinegar notes in a typical rodenbach. Instead the back half the the beer is dominated by huge notes of cranberry, cherry and raspberry. Moderately sweet but sour enough to achieve near perfect balance, this beer is really only lacking in the nose, and note because the nose is bad in any ways, but just because it simply doesnt match the incredible flavor. Probably the best Rodenbach I have ever had, and Ive had them all at this point. Huge thanks to hopscotch for sharing this.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
1133,"2012-07-11",4.9,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2013 Bottle (Batch 1)... This beer rocks! Cloudy caramel-colored ale with orange highlights and a small fizzy, off-white head that never fully dissipates. The bouquet is crazy fruity; providing cherries, loads of acidity, caramel, vanilla, raspberry and red currants with a light splash of pinot noir vinegar.  Medium to full bodied and super creamy with prickly carbonation. The flavor is every bit as fantastic as Alexander, but so much more fruity. Both acidic and acetic, this brew presents notes of caramel, raspberry and cherry, accompanied by a dainty splash of red wine vinegar. Sour, fruity, puckering finish.

Belle présence vineuse. Robe rousse et limpide, effervescence assez active mais peu de mousse. En bouche, on retrouve le caractère classique de la Rodenbach, avec une présence de caramel et un côté vineux et vinaigré. Les fruits sont très intenses et on identifie vraiment la contribution des trois variétés utilisées. Finale plutôt sucrée et acide. Une belle bière, plutôt originale.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"

1133,"2012-01-01",4.0,"Shortlived dirty-pink head over hazed foxy red-copper beer. Intense acids: lactic and acetic, but also lots of red fruit (cherry, raspberry, little scarlets and quite outspoken redcurrant). Zeste of some strange sourish fruit (not so bitter as cranberry). Excellent, fine, but very sharp acidic fruitflavour: raspberry mainly, maybe some cherry, but also more exotic fruit (rosehips, quinces, pink grapefruit, redcurrant). Ends very tart, but the fruitflavours keep going on for minutes. Sharp acidburn, rather light body thanks to the acidthinning. Excellent, but just too acidic to be more than a general 8/10.

1133,"2011-12-10",4.5,"75cl bottle, cheers to ajax25g for sharing this one. Bottle ?/900 no label just a description tag. Had this right after a vintage Vin de Céréale 2004, what a nice contrast between the two.
Couleur cuivrée allant vers un rubis, le tout sur qcq bulles blanches.
Arôme est de fruits rouges, je note plus la framboise qui prend un peu le dessus sur la cerise et canneberge.  Ressent aussi le beau profile du foudre de chêne avec un bouquet prononcé de vinaigre.
En bouche, un profile énorme de vinaigre qui enrobe le palais. Le tout est en addition de laigreur des fruits rouges qui à lorigine sont déjà assez acidulés. Encore ici, je note le framboise plus en avant, suivi juste de la cerise. Canneberge reste plus discrète. Garde bien sur la signature Rodenbach avec ce beau profile boisé de chêne. 
Une aigreur très en avant mais qui convient tout à fait à cette bière et à son niveau dalcool. Se déguste doucement. Pour moi, un vrai plaisir à partager et une belle expérience dans un style qui nest pas assez représenté en Belgique.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
