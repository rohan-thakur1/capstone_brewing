4440,"2017-06-17",4.1,"Bottle at Cantillon, split 3 ways with the wife and Mike (bytemesis), cheers! Pours a deep purple, slightly murky. No head, no lace. Aromas of grape jam, WelchÂ’s grape juice, medium horse blanket funk, light oak and light hay. Taste is fairly soft, compared to reg St. Lam. Mild acidic note into medium tart grape, vinous notes, nice oak touch. Medium hay, earth, light sweet grape juice. Finishes nicely balanced, with tiny bitter brett and medium grape juice. A bit flat, but definitely a great beer.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

4440,"2017-06-04",3.7,"75CL at the brewery. ItÂ’s a dark muted purple color. Blood red. This smells amazing. Smells like a smuckers grape jelly, old shoe, leather and cherry juice. ItÂ’s pretty much flat which is a bummer. Not sure if others had this with carbonation or itÂ’s just me. If you take a big gulp, itÂ’s a very acidic tart puckering feeling on the back of your throat. The flavor itself isnÂ’t actually jammy. ItÂ’s more like wet vine, soil, leaves, apple and some cherry. Grape is of course there but no need to mention that. ItÂ’s tingly in the sourness with a hardcore swish. More jelly. Finish is earthy and bold with a resting bitternesss","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

4440,"2017-04-21",4.5,"Bottle at Cantillon, shared with SinH4. Pours slightly foggy cherry ruby with almost no head. Aroma is distinct grapes and some barrel with tannins, very little funk. Medium body, decently tart and sour, still fruity sweet grapes, but a little stingy in bitterness towards the palate. Still a smooth experience leading to a dry palate. Almost no Lambic properties left, almost no funk throughout. Very good!","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","anstei"
4440,"2017-04-21",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2017 Bottle shared with anstei at Cantillon, my 30th Cantillon tick. Hazy ruby color with small soapy head. Aroma is lots of mellow grapes, just a touch of funk at the first smell, afterwards lots of grapes. Taste has mellow grapes, peppery, and quite some tanninic bitterness in the finish. Very soft mouthfeel with just an ? (epsilon) of carbonation. Very nice and mellow, definitely more straight into the grapes than regular St Lam.","Garching b. MÃ¼nchen, GERMANY","SinH4"
4440,"2017-04-17",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
This extremely juicy iteration of St-Lamvinus almost forgets that it is a Lambic, focusing instead of the character of the grapes it harbors.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam tops the pinkish red haze.
-These grapes are pretty evocative.
-Carbonation is quite low, which increases the impression of juiciness.
-Acidity levels are moderate for Cantillon.

4440,"2017-04-16",4.0,"Bottle (750 m) at tasting. Massive thanks to Simon for sharing! Clear deep purple-ish red with a minimal bubbly ring of foam, no retention or lacing. Aroma is intensely red grapes forward with a well integrated oak spiciness, some cobweb/musty basement notes - but much less than the Carignan and Menu Pineau we had just before - mineral notes and light herbalness. Taste is vinous with red grapes aplenty, mild oak spiciness, moderate musty notes and hints of yogurt. Medium body. Still. Tannic mouthfeel. Red grapes and vinous finish. Drying. I prefer the regular St. Lamvinus but itÂ’s a fun and enjoyable experiment no doubt about it. Nice mix of grapey and spicy oak & fruits notes.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

4440,"2017-03-12",4.3,"#50 Cantillon. 750 ml. bottle @ brewery. How is that for a sample size! This one is another wine hybrid brew by Cantillon who see themselves as wine makers and not brewers. They release products so funky & wild that even the most far out natural producer wouldnÂ’t dare to sell. I love the funk, the wildness, well the lambiek basically. Pours very deep red ruby with baiscally no head. Nose is extreme massive yoghurt profile with sour cherries & red grapes blended in. Profile is sour yoghurt, thick with fruit to the max, yoghurt lactic, no funk here actually, fermenting red grape, more sour yoghurt, red grapes, big fruit & more yoghurt. Body is all yoghurt as well. Interesting but feels like it will improve over time and gain complexity. I prefer the basic Saint Lamvinus vastly with age, about 2 years does the trick for me. Very good & interesting stuff but feels a touch too young for me.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
