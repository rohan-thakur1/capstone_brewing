1019,"2017-04-29",4.2,"December 13th, 2014 - Bells Expedition Stout feels like part of a panther at this point. Classic, well known, and an established reputation, its small wonder I dont have the Expedition Stout with more frequency, save for the previous barrier of being in a part of the country where Bells didnt distribute. The Expedition Stout advertises its unctuous intensity from the pour, slow and oily, like pouring a thick dark nectar into the glass. And there it sits like an anchor, unperturbed, with just a thin, soy-sauce like foam on top, barely a quarter of a centimeter. This allows the heavy aroma to unfurl from the brew, like the Old Rasputin but darker. Notes of charcoal, pine can and steak fond, with a licorice lacquer. The flavor is even more engaging, with a forward boozy quality that is strong by restrained. The heavy flavor oozes with a long, delicious caramel flavor and licorice aftertaste, direct and exquisitely balanced. Not especially complex, the flavors are direct and candid, but also harmonious.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1019,"2017-04-28",4.7,"I love this beer. The first time I had it was watching a Bruins game while at a secluded beach shack of a bar in FL (13). This beer pours black in color with a tan head. Chocolate, caramel, roast aromas. Thick and intense flavor; immensely chocolatey with roast edges that hit hard in the cheeks but then coats the mouth and lingers. This is really just a classic in the style and amazingly stands above so many that have come along since.

1019,"2017-03-14",2.0,"This is a top beer? Ok, good luck with that. My local beer-source had this so I thought Id try it out. Unfortunately its a very disappointing beer. It pours like it should, for a stout of high character, but it has utterly no diversity on the tongue that I can tell. Honestly I just wash through these and barely notice I had them. I recall being very disappointed on first sip that it wasnt actually the flavorful, nuanced beer I had paid 16+ change for but rather a watery, washed out stout that has all the characteristics of goodness but none of the depth. Looking for chocolate, vanilla bean, coffee? Not here. Not even peppers, I honesty cant taste anything in this beer. That this is a top 50 beer to me is hilarious, or maybe its because these people havent tasted Yeti stouts. I immediately thought this stout tries to do what Yeti does but fails. Reason Yetis been top of the heap for years, still best stout poured out of a regular bottle. 

The biggest disappointment, is again, the indecipherable taste, which one assumes was guessable when you realize theres no description of the flavor profile on the bottle wrapping. One of the more boring beers and for the price a complete waste. You all should get out to a pub and try more beers. Id take Dogfish head Breakfast Stout over this any day because at least you can taste something, even if its too sweet. Honestly I think they should take this expedition stout back to the lab because it didnt work, the party was lost.","","DraftCaptain49"

1019,"2016-05-25",4.0,"Jeden z pierwszych RIS-ów w Stanach Zjedoczonych. Pierwsze rankingi na RB są już z 2000-go roku! 
 Alkohol:  10,5% obj.
 Data butelkowania:  09.02.2015 
 Kolor:  Smoliście czarny. Zupełny brak prześwitów. 
 Piana:  Jak na tak kultowego RIS-a przystało pianę można zjadać łyżkami jak bitą śmietanę. Jest zawiesista, puszysta, drobnoziarnista. Po czasie drobne ziarenka przekształcają się w średnie, a nawet duże oczka. Piana bardzo długo faluje na powierzchni. Krążkowanie b. dobre, chociaż nie wzorowe. Kołnierzyk dostojnie podkreśla klasę trunku. 
 Zapach:  Olbrzymia moc słodkich składowych.
W pierwszym rzucie wychodzą na prostą ciemne owoce, w szczególności winogrona.
Zaraz potem duża porcja karmelu i gorzkiej czekolady.
Na dalekim planie nuty czerwonego wina i delikatny powiew szlachetnego alkoholu. Po ogrzaniu ujawnia się gigantyczny wręcz sos sojowy. Paloność umiarkowana. Aromat chociaż intensywny to z pewnością nie jest rzędu 10/10. 
 Smak:  Im bardziej skupiam się na początkowej słodyczy RIS-a, tym bardziej balans przesuwa się w stronę wytrawną. Początkowe tak słodkie nuty gorzkiej czekolady, karmelu, lukrecji i szlachetnej whisky zaczynają stawać się coraz bardziej wytrawne. Dużo tutaj również sosu sojowego, popiołu, a także tytoniu.
Goryczka jest masywna, długa, chwilami zalegająca. Bez wahania celował bym w +100 IBU.
Posmak palonego słodu i orzechów włoskich przez dłuższy czas paraliżuje język.
Alkohol dość wyraźny, jak po przełknięciu baryłek czekoladowych mocno nasączonych spirytusem.
Oleista, gęsta i ciężka faktura.
Jest przyjemnie, rozgrzewająco, dostojnie, ale trzeba podchodzić do tego piwa z rozwagą. Alkohol może tutaj sporo namieszać w głowie.
Potężny trunek! Wybitnie degustacyjny. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Solidny Imperialny Stout. Z pewnością nie dla każdego. Jest dość ciężki w odbiorze, chwilami mocno alkoholowy, ale z całą pewnością ma wciąż wiele do zaoferowania.
Nie uświadczyłem w nim grama tak charakterystycznej dla RIS-ów kawy.
Początkowa gorzka czekolada, karmel i lukrecja tracą z każdą minutą na swojej intensywności. Zyskuje za to wysoka paloność, orzechy włoskie, tytoń i popiół. Sos sojowy także staje się nieodłączną składową trunku.

Miałem ogromne oczekiwania w stosunku do tego RIS-a. Naczytałem się tylu wyrywających z butów opini. Myślałem, że będzie miazga. Piwo tymczasem jest dobre.
W moim mniemaniu niestety....tylko dobre.
A przy tej klasie trunku, to troszeczkę za mało.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

The beer was poured at fridge temperature (meter says 13 degrees celsius at the surface) into a footed Maisel & Friends tulip glass revealing a pitch black body with one finger toffee head. Decent retention and beautiful lace. Aroma has dark fruits, toffee and roasted malt along with some boozy notes that are however well integrated yielding a slightly medicinal yet pleasant result. Creamy texture, soft carbonation, full body and a sweet, warming finish. This is good stuff. Flavour is well balanced with dominant sweet component.

Même si cette bière nest pas bien difficile à obtenir, je me faisais un devoir de la déguster dans une circonstance choisie. Un liquide parfaitement noir et dune densité irréprochable. La mousse caramel brûlé se forme tranquillement, dabord en une pré-mousse des plus riches, ensuite dans une couverture noble et soutenue. Une fois la mousse réduite à un mince anneau, mon verre demeure taché de cette crème brûlée. Magnifique! Un nez qui me plaît peu ou plutôt, qui me déçoit. Je ny note rien qui vaille une 16e place au rang RateBeer. Des malts rôtis, de la fumée et une étoile de badiane, comme on en retrouve très fréquemment dans les RIS dEurope du Nord. Des grains de café grillés. En bouche par contre cest une toute autre histoire. Des saveurs évolutives soutenues par une texture crémeuse et onctueuse. Lattaque est marquée par un doux caramel presque salé. Puis suit une mélasse, un chocolat noir et finalement un café bien torréfié et amer qui persiste jusquà la gorgée suivante.

A stronger sniff unveils booze, licorice, and ashy burnt malt. Taste is molasses again. Really creamy in the middle with just a little bit of sweetness and then the onslaught begins. Licorice, dark fruits, the darkest chocolate. Burnt pieces of chocolate, really. Ashy and extremely bitter. Booze comes back at the last gasp and bites the throat.

This was poured into a mini snifter.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a less than a fingers worth of foamy tan head that dissipated within less than about 30 seconds.
The smell had a big roasty to semi-smooth bitter coffee bean leading into a delicate cocoa and light vanilla to round it all out.
The taste was pretty smoothed due to the date, Im guessing, still a nice roasty smooth coffee and cocoa delicately weaves together to lead to a decent sly roasty aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation definitely smoothed a bit with a nice drying edge leading into a rounded out stickiness over my tongue.

1019,"2015-04-17",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2016 One of the most classic and critically acclaimed American imperial stouts. Very dark mahogany brown colour, almost black but still transparent on the edges in the end and in that sense a bit less dark than many other imperial stouts, under a dense and creamy, cappuccino-like, tan head with good lacing and good retention; the beer itself also leaves thick, oily, yellow legs, as expected. Powerful bouquet rising up from the bottle upon opening... I put my nose above the snifter and I find myself in beer heaven once again: the purest fondant chocolate, ristretto, candied dates, raisins, brown bread, some baked banana, charcoal, fine cognac with a fine cigar, something pleasantly and refinedly sourish not unlike balsamic vinegar but very subtle, bayleaf, subtle vanilla notes, mocha ice cream, fine hints of peat, fermenting soy sauce, pine wood, even something flowery and a very refined and subtle sweetness reminiscent of tawny port. Pointy, aristocratic taste, with a noble, restrained candied sweetness in the onset, very light sourish, salty and umami accents all working perfectly well together, oily and supple mouthfeel, not too sticky as is often the case in this style, soft carbonation exactly as it should be, with prickly little stings to the tongue, providing perfect balance with a powerful, profound yet still relatively light and elegant maltiness, deeply nutty and bitterly chocolatey, a bitterness which becomes even more powerful when the roasted barley appears in full strength, leading to a very pungent, creamy, mouth-lining, deep bitterness embellished with some floral and resinous hops and gently, but deeply warming, bourbon-like alcohol. The fine, powerful but still delicate, almost woody and nutty espresso bitterness remains in the back of the mouth for hours...  In my quest to find the best stout (or beer, for that matter) in the world, this gets eerily close: the word balanced may be used all too often, but here it clearly is no cliché. You can feel that this brew is made with the greatest care; there is not one flaw in it, every part fits in perfectly... Gracious sweetness pops up, makes room for a deep bitter tone, and so the play goes on.  This is one of those authentic, Id almost say historically evocative executions of the style, it makes me feel Im at the court of the czars, like the aged Courage Russian Imperial Stout did when I first tasted it. This stout is so cleverly made, it does not need any further additions, no barrel ageing, no weird ingredients like chilli peppers or whatever; not cloying, no burning alcohol in the finish, good head formation - and retention, noble, elegant, restrained, this achieves near perfection to my taste. Yet, I still have to taste that Black Note version, waiting in the cellar, so Ill refrain from giving it a perfect score - for now. Wow... Im sure anything else Ill have on my tasting table tonight will only be trivial compared to this. Fantastic.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

First were strong chocolate smells followed by sherry, malt and pine. The alcohol also does come through at times.

It is full bodied, light to medium carbonation, warm and sticky. I only got 2 bottles of this and this was the second bottle.

Doesnt come off as boozy in any way at all. Almost a bit of vanilla that sneaks in to an otherwise chocolate filled finish. I cant wait to give this one some age. Perhaps the best stout I have ever had, and ranks up there with the best of beers as well. Incredible stout. Absolutely love this.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

Only the barest hint of dark fruit flavors/aroma. Not bad, but Im more interested in how this tastes with a year or two on it.

Tasted 8/22/2015. Pitch-black, almost no head. Smell is chocolate/cacao, sorghum, rich syrupy character. Taste is smooth, a little bitter -- coffee, cocoa powder, cacao nibs, deep stone fruit flavors, charred wood, but the hops come across strong as well -- theres a floral, piney presence to all this. Really interesting and will only get better with time.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jh773"

Poured into a teku glass, showing pitch ink black and very little if any latte foam that fades into swirls in the glass. 

The nose is complex - a lot of bourbon and charred wood. Generous notes of dark chocolate and coffee beans. Also lighter hints of vanilla. 

The palate shows an oily, slick, impossibly smooth, and light body. The first impression shows a lot of the bourbon, and smoked wood with light hints of the dark chocolate. The mid palate matures into more of the bourbon and smokiness. The finish shows a noticeable but short sweetness akin to vanilla or a milk stout and a strong but not overwhelming espresso bitterness. This is a really tasty sipper. Very curious to see how this ages.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

Aroma really jumps with coffee, dark chocolate, and prunes. A bit of a charred character hinting at the roastyness. 

The flavor when cold is really bitter with a tartness that surprised me. As the beer warmed, however, this smoothed out considerably and everything just seemed to meld. Coffee, char, and dark fruit just seem to be married perfectly with just enough bitterness to keep the sweetness in check. Incredible mouthfeel that is silky smooth and the alcohol is barely noticeable.

Smooth and full-bodied on the palate, a solid thick beer that truly meets that &quot;meal-in-a-glass&quot; description. Taste is mostly rich coffee with a little dark chocolate, not as complex as others as claimed, but still enjoyable. One of the most impressive aspects of this brew was the minimal booziness despite the high ABV, finished refreshing with no tartness, a at least in my experience.

Pours like old motor oil, and I mean that in the best way possible. I appreciate the wide range of aromas that people detect in this, but all I smelled was dark chocolate. The whole beer smells like a 70% cocoa chocolate. Surprising amount of carbonation up front, taste is very bitter. Obviously very roasty and malty, but theres some pininess about it for sure. On the back end all that classic Russian imperial stout stuff shines through: coffee, chocolate, date, plum. Really heavy mouthfeel, to be expected from a beer that is nothing to trifle with. Gets much better as it warms. Overall, a bold take on the style that doesnt make me feel like Im drinking alcoholic hot chocolate.","Youngstown, Ohio, USA","coombuyah26"

Both poured into their own snifters, respectively. Beautiful black base with uniform dark khaki heads on each. Aromas of roasted coffee, cocoa, dark bittersweet chocolate, figs, licorice and brown sugar. The fresh snifter was definitely a touch more bitter, the year old had the ""edge"" taken off a bit. I would also say the year old was just slightly more sticky in mouth-feel maybe a little sweeter as well. Towards the end I blended the two together and finished up. Surprisingly not as bitter in the blend as well so that was nice to see.

1019,"2014-11-17",4.1,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.

A: Pours almost exactly like Old Engine Oil, a thick, viscous black. Almost no head formed with my pour, with what did appear a deep tan. It quickly receded to a ring and patchy cap. No light gets through this beer. None. Not a speck of it, anywhere, along any edge.

S: The smell is roasted chocolate malt, with notes that remind me of a bourbon barrel, oak and booze. Theres definitely some dark fruits playing around in the background as well, like midgits running along the hills the FSM made with His Noodly Appendages.

T: A rush of darkly-roasted, burnt-black bitter chocolate malt opens the taste,which quickly transforms into a swirl of flavors. Seared molasses, espresso, cherries, prunes, and figs all dance about the mouth, atop a stage of dark earth bitterness with some pine needles mixed in. Theres some alcohol burn involved as well, particularly on the back and finish.

M: Oily, thick, chewy, and sticky, this is what a good RIS should drink like.

O: This is a darned good RIS. Being a malthead, Id have loved to see a little less showcasing of the earthy-pine hop flavors, which are noticeable and sort of horn in on the malt profile.

Smelled booziness up front, initially reminding me of a mudslide - vodka, coffee liquor and Irish cream liquor. Also the usual suspects - caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, roasty malts, nutty malts and cocoa powder. A tad like a chocolate milkshake, too. Not too bad on the nose. (Smell - 4.00)

1019,"2014-10-05",4.6,"From the label: ""13415 PKGD 08/22/14 C"" so it is just under two months old.

Appearance: Oily black with a thick creamy khaki head that fades leaving fine bubbled lacing on the glass.

Aroma: I pick up the scent of caramel and a hint of coffee. It is very light on the aroma.

Taste: It has a very very rich flavor consisting of coffee, oak, chocolate, molasses, and a hint of bourbon around the edge. The bottle doesnt say anything about bourbon barrels or anything but this is how it tastes. It is a very excellent tasting stout.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is superb. It is thick and smooth. It is a sipper, but it doesnt burn with the high alcohol content.

Overall: This is a very excellent RIS. It is thick, smooth, and full of flavor. Less than two months in the bottle and it has the quality of a well-aged imperial stout. I highly recommend trying this out and buying more than one. It is very easy to drink and is delicious.","","teromous"
1019,"2014-10-05",4.5,"Bottle traded with Steasy66 a year or so ago. Pours very very dark brown to opaque black out of the bottle with a tan head which dissipates to nothing very quickly. It looks rich with some dark brown clarity at the edges in the glass. Nose is malty, yeasty, yeast extract, little bourbon barrel perhaps, Shreddies malty cereal. Any coffee or chocolate is very subtle in the nose. Little buttery. Taste is very fine. It has a lightness and a delicate body which is very unusual for an imperial stout. Silky and luscious body on the tongue. Very slight oiliness. Ill get to the flavours in a moment, but the mouthfeel is remarkable. Taste is really quite hard to describe. A real blend of perfection. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, yeast extract saltiness, very subtle black coffee in the background somewhere, something vinous and alcoholic like the kind of sunshine you get in a Sauternes, syrupy dark chocolate, the beginnings of some dried dark fruit or roasted gooey plums. Each flavour is almost perfectly balanced. The roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate blends perfectly. The yeast extract maltiness and saltiness is slightly dominating, which is my only pedantic criticism. Soy sauce saltiness. The mouthfeel is just a revelation. Never had something with this silky oily vinous texture other than sweet wines. Its not thick though, really light. Ive had a lot of American imperial stouts which are just totally overrated or bourbon bombs, but this is almost perfectly balanced. Its almost a perfection of subtlety, mouthfeel and texture.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

1019,"2014-09-17",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 7-9-13-

 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a nearly pitch black color with a one finger tan colored head. The head fades rather fast leaving only a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma was dark and roasty with lots of roasted malt, chocolate malt and coffee aromas. The chocolate is a mix of both bitter cocoa and sweet milk chocolate with aromas of vanilla and caramel adding to the milk chocolate sweet smell. Mixed with these aromas is a little bit of smoke and hop as well as some lighter notes of darker fruits giving a rather roasted and sweet aroma overall.

 Taste  The taste begins with a nice roasted malt flavor with lots of chocolate and coffee upfront. The chocolate starts out a little more on the roasted/cocoa side but gains a sweetness as vanilla, milk and caramel come to the tongue. While a more milk chocolate flavor develops more toward the middle it is balanced by an increase in the coffee bitterness of the brew. Toward the end the sweeter flavors fade more while the coffee remains the same. With a lighter earthy and herbal hop flavor coming to the tongue at the end, along with a light alcohol flavor that comes to the tongue at the end, a nice roasted and moderately sweet and bitter (of coffee and hop) flavor is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker and quite creamy side with a carbonation level that was rather average. The feel of this one was quite nice and very appropriate and fitting for the roasted flavors and big feel of the brew.

 Overall - A very delicious imperial with a good blend of roasted malt flavors, sweetness, a tad of booziness, and a nice bitter hop and coffee flavor mixed within. Definitely one to try.","","Darkmagus82"

It has quite a deep and somewhat complex aroma. Somewhat on the sweet side with lots of sweet licorice, lots of confectionery chocolate. So much that Im having a hard time member in the last time I had this much confectionery chocolate in a beer. Soft vanilla, a little gift of green banana and oak. Not sure if this had been barreled on anything, but it definitely smells of oak. A little bit of charcoal and lots of licorice! Its really comfortably carbonated with a good solid oily mouthfeel. Chocolate, roasted, a fantastic bitterness. Just a lovely flavored beer. The finish is packed with dark chocolate.

1019,"2014-01-18",4.5,"Aroma - is full of chocolate and alcohol. There are other elements as well.
Appearance - The appearance on initial pour is amazing! Its moves quickly from its black 1/4 glass fill to that stout set-up where it starts cascading in the glass and turns brown and bubbly. The final set up results in a black body with a big frothy tannish brown head. All the way through it maintains a tan halo.
Taste - the taste is full and complex. Its a perfect balance of coffee, chocolate, alcohol, roasty bitterness, and dark fruit seeps in on the back end.
Palate - the body is full as it gets. The texture is intensely creamy. The carbonation is lively, and the finish is a big long play bitter alcohol pleasant burn.

A - Creamy black liquid with a thick and frothy chocolate milk cap that holds up throughout the entire session. Speckled lacing left on the glass.

S - Chocolate malts, roasted malts, chocolate bread, muddled fruit, sweet cream, chocolate lined alcohol.

T - Creamy milk chocolate upfront, sweet and decadent, heavily roasted malts and strong bitterness come in quickly and overtake the creamy sweetness. The middle provides anise, smoked molasses, and a strong bitterness that runs throughout the drink. The finish brings intense roasted malts, bittering chocolate, notions of fruit, hints of grass and winds up for a smooth and roasted chocolate finish.

M - Incredibly viscous, thick and full bodied. Moderate micro carbonation, dry roasted finish. One of the best mouthfeels Ive come across.

Theres something to be said about being complex in a simple way. This beer is simple but it brings outstanding precision and subtle complexities, with a strong bitterness to round out the sweetness. Very focused flavors that bring maximum flavor with a stellar body that is as creamy as they come. My favorite Bells by far!

Ive been cellaring this beer for a year now and tasting them every 6 months. At first it was much more stouty. It tasted like a 10.5% beer. It was sort of boozy but a very sweet and over the top chocolate flavor. As it has aged it has slid away from the booziness and more towards the chocolate malty flavor. This is a great beer.

A: Pours dark brown with no head formation. Upon stir, get a temporary dark mocha, loose bubbled head (1/2 finger) which disappears very quickly. Border remains.
A2: Dark brown, under 1/2 finger dark mocha head falls slowly to a broken sheet of the same. Spotty lacing. Clarity irrelevant. 

S: Roasted malts, grains, hints of dates, figs, licorice. Theres quite a metallic scent here too, a bit off setting. (2.5)
S2: Roasted malts of coffee, dates and prunes. My initial impression upon opening this beer was a healthy dose of molasses, I no longer really smell this. Some cocoa there as well. Licorice is evident, but nicely integrated. (3)

T: Wow, the licorice takes over here. Also quite bitter. Dark, unsweetened cocoa in here. Fairly one dimensional. Finish resonates for what seems forever. It tastes burnt. (3) 
T2: Dry cocoa powder, licorice, burnt coffee, molasses now bites back. Hmm, reminds me of burnt toast with a wee bit of cinnamon/sugar over the top (very wee bit). (3.5)

M: Thick, low carbonation, very very sticky. (3)
M2: Thinned out a bit, medium on low carbonation. Leaves a sticky finish with a dry feel. (3)

D: One is more than enough. I cant stand behind this beer. (3)
O2: This beer is too roasted and burnt tasting for me. If it had a bit more molasses flavor, it would remind me of Nightstalker by GI. Although I dislike how sweet NightStalker comes across, this one comes out with too much of the burnt malts and not enough balance with the other flavors. (3)

1019,"2013-11-25",5.0,"Wow. Complex and amazing. I had to laugh as I was pouring it--it almost looks like some kind of thick motor oil going into the glass, and then, even with a nonaggressive pour, theres all that deliciously chocolate-like foam. The aroma is dark cherry, bourbon, chocolate, figs. The flavors meld all of the aforementioned with an earthy toasted malt. The 10.5 ABV is a bit evident in the nose but well-hidden in the taste. Palate is smooth as can be. Hops come through casually in the finish. I am not a fan of stouts, and in fact, generally avoid them. Theyre usually much too roasted and smoky for me, but this one has much more going on, and the roast and smoke are held to the background.

1019,"2013-11-08",4.3,"Bottled 8/22/13 and poured into a shaker pint : ... I wanted to age this one, but decided to drink it now, and then age any bottles that I get later. $2.99 single.

Appearance: I poured aggressively thinking this wouldnt give me much of a head, boy was I wrong. I got about 90% of the beer poured and the glass was full, almost half with foam. Gorgeous beer, and one of the best RISs Ive seen. As youd expect, the beers an abyss. The mocha (almost orange) three finger or more of head dies down to about half of one. Lacing is phenomenal.

Smell: Quite good, but just not quite what I was hoping for. Has a very nice aroma to it, but its not as pungent as I was hoping for. Maybe its the thick head I have on top thats blocking out some of the notes. Roasted coffee, deep, dark chocolate, a hint of smoke/ash, and a bit of soy sauce. As Expedition Stout warms, nondescript dark fruits come out to play.

Taste/feel: First off, the feel. It is every bit of what an RIS lover would hope for. Super thick and creamy, with a subtle carbonation. The taste is fabulous, though, like the smell, not killing me with gigantic bold flavors, and the bitterness isnt nearly as harsh as I was lead to believe. Like the smell, roast, coffee, chocolate... theres also a pretty big ash sort of flavor on the finish. There is an alcohol warmth (surprised, surprise!), but there doesnt really seem to be an alcohol flavor... maybe slightly.

Overall, I actually want more out of this. It has a big body. It has a really bold ""feel"" to it, but the flavor isnt reeking of coffee or chocolate like I thought it might. Still, Im ecstatic that I enjoy RISs as much as I do now. Im really enjoying this beer... I couldnt ask for more from the appearance and mouthfeel, as they are truly flawless.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

1019,"2013-09-30",4.8,"(3/26/13) Pour - A deep black brown with a finger of creamy mocha head. Pour it in a cappuccino cup and I would think I was having a cappuccino.

Nose - Tons of malty sweetness. Both bakers and milk chocolate. Roastiness. There are some notes of wood too. Its like booze soaked chocolate cake.

Taste - Again, lots of malty sweetness. Dark chocolate bitterness. Coffee roast and espresso. A bit of roasty earthy bitterness on the finish. Complex and subtle.

Mouthfeel - Thick, creamy, and silky.

Overall - Elegant is the word that comes to mind when I describe this. The aromas and flavors are subtle and play off of one another. This brew (with 4 months on it) was not nearly as in your face as other Russian imperials, and much sweeter as well. I had the same feel drinking this as I do when I have dessert at a good restaurant.","","Lognar"

There is also this awful toffee and vanilla that doesnt work at all.  In the background, there is this dark chocolate that seems to remind me of the 1st bottle of this 6-pack I had 6 months ago.  The mouth is fantastic at this point though.  Velvety and smooth, and dark chocolate in the back of the mouth that lingers for quite a while.

1019,"2013-04-10",4.3,"Aroma: honey and molasses hit the nose in the bottle and in the snifter; almost reminiscient of bbq sauce with a little soy sauce.

Not as rich and roasty as I remember my last glass, but that may be because I poured at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Going to let it warm up a bit.

 Blind RIS experiment [Sample 13 of 20, 4/28/2015] 
 Fresh bottle (2014)
Poured by Summer. Dark brown, with ample light brown head (1 finger or so); dissipates to a ring, some lacing splotches. Aroma: mmm, this smells good. Rich thick chocolate syrup. Roast bordering on smoke and ash. Taste: Sweet, chocolate balanced with roast. Cookie/biscuit going on, giving this nice chocolate-covered cookie dough with graham cracker base. Palate: silky, sexy velvety smooth. Full body. Definitely potent -- Id guess this could go even northward of 11%. Overall: This is great. So much better than anything Ive had so far.
 
Guess: Evil Twin or maybe 10 Fiddy -- not getting the metal that usually ruins 10.5 for me, and loads of roasty smoky stuff, so Im guessing ET? Im kind of praying that this is Expedition, though, since I remember this level of excitement from that beer my first time.
 
Would pay: $5 / bottle no problem. I hope this is a shelfy. 
RB rating: 9/4/9/5/17. 
------- /> 
Blind RIS experiment [Sample 7 of 20, 4/11/2015]
 Aged bottle (4+ years)
Poured by Summer. Near black pour with deep brown head, dissipates in short order to a ring. Aroma: this smells old, so Im pretty sure its the Expo I put in the mix (only aged bottle). The oldest bottle of this Ive had, though, so thats a fun treat and new experience. Anyway: oxidation is present, and works well -- the aged hops/oxidation lends a deep dark fruit quality. Roast is subdued.
 
In the mouth: ooh, this is nice. Very flavorful, with lots of chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit, pleasant subdued roast. Its all very mellow, though -- it gels. My hypothesis is that this ""mellow, subdued, muted with combo of nice sweetness and quiet dry, oxidized finish"" is due to the aging. If it is in fact Expy then Ill have a chance to see how I like the fresh bottle. Full body, oily texture, average carbonation.
 
Overall: IMO, this is probably a testament to a well-made beer that has aged well. Many dont. This one has. (Of course, it will be hilarious if I find out later this is not an old beer at all, in which case we can all just laugh at me.)
 
RB rating: 8/4/9/4/16 
Would pay: up to $5 / bottle without much hesitation as a ""once in awhile"" beer. $4/bottle as a regular thing.

Addendum: Even though its lovely, something about 12 oz of old beer isnt nearly as nice as 6 oz of old beer. I should remember this before I try any more aging experiments ... keep doing them, but be sure I have people with whom to share :).
-------- /> 
(2/23/2015) Ive had this several time since this first rating. My first rating should not be forgotten - as a ""high water mark,"" as Carl sometimes puts it, 4.7 is where this belongs. At its best, this beer is magical. At it worst, its still great. Re-rates (both blind and sighted) have ranged from 3.9 (low) to 4.2-4.3 (more typical), but never quite so high as the first time. Still hands down my favorite imperial stout.

Eloquent, creamy, cascading layers of treacle, chocolate, licorice, dark caramel, and pie crust with accents of piney-citrusy hops, figs, smoke, and brown sugar on a heavy, coating palate finishing with a focus on the chocolatey pie crust notes merging into a drying, spicy, softly warming finish

Batch 11503 bottled 10/22/12
Aromas of mocha ice cream with a splash of blueberry, flavors offer a flash of the acidic, lemony, woody notes set to develop, then wonderful, rich dark chocolate notes, fig and raisin, plumb and dark berry nuances come into play with faint vinous accents, as residuals build, the dark sweet treacle notes appear, prefacing black licorice and cola, sweet with a more acidic cutting bitterness which creates a sharper, less elaborate finish, really nice with some interesting developments in year one

Batch 9435 bottled 11/11/2009
Yikes, this batch comes off acidic and shallow at this age, wafting some muddled brown notes reminiscent of dehydrated cow patty and leather, there are a few transitional notes of chocolate cherry and an overlay of woody espresso like roast, but this is generally unimpressive and unenjoyable, based on reputation, this one must be in a funk, hopefully trending towards something sweeter in a couple years, this acidic, shallow state seems to be par for the course on 3-4 year aged American imperial stouts, had very similar results from Yeti and Founders, well see what happens with the other bottles from this batch in a few years

1019,"2012-12-27",3.4,"Reviewed 12/21/2012. 12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a pitch black color. No ""really dark brown"" bollocks, this one is nearly perfectly opaque. The head is a one finger tan color that gives Ten Fidy a run for its money in terms of darkness. The retention is pretty good, and a thick collar around the glass diameter lingers nicely.

S: I immediately notice a large amount of dark fruits, like raisins, currants, and plums. Beneath that, theres a bit of licorice, anise, coffee, chocolate. and light booze. Very similar to a revved-up version of the Stone IRS - if we can compare it to any other RIS on the market, that is.

T: The flavor seems roastier than the aroma. Roasted malts open the flavor profile with a punch to the face, before a fruity midtaste and alcoholic, vaguely hoppy finish. Even for an imperial stout, the balance is lacking. Really, the palate is just beat down with roast, bittersweet dark fruits, and booze. Not much subtlety here - its aggressive and even harsh. If there was any beer that was more suitable for drinking after a year in the cellar, this is it.

M: Thick as a brick. I cant think of any other way to describe the bigness of the body. It finishes with a lot of wet slickness and lingering roasted malts. It certainly feels decadent, but again, the big booze detracts instead of complimenting the flavor profile.

O: This one is a bit harsh, frankly. Good news is, aging it will kill that harshness stone dead. Bad news is, I only bought a single bottle. Damnit. Then again, Im of the school of thought that a beer should be consumed as soon as its purchased, so the middling scores stand.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Aroma is a balanced blend of chocolate, roast and a touch of alcohol. There is a bit of oxidation and soy sauce creeping into this beer. A touch of dark fruit, mainly cherry and prune. There is a bit of a molasses and burnt caramel note as well. 
Pours a deep black with a thick mocha head that recedes steadily leaving a nice film on the edges. 
Flavor has rich, sweet chocolate notes with some lighter roast character. Some hints of dark caramel present as well. Some low dark fruit character, similar to dark cheers and prunes. A solid bitterness helps balance the beer, though by this time the hop flavor has faded. Some alcohol spice in the finish. Some oxidation, and in particular soy sauce, is starting to show; as it warms the soy sauce fades away and takes on more of a sherry note. The roast character takes on a touch of a smoked meat character in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy. Carbonation is fairly low which only helps to make this beer seem thick. The alcohol is present and warming but quite clean. Astringency is low and almost non existent. 
Overall it's a nice beer, but I would like to have tried it next to a fresh version. I don't know that I would let this go more than two years as its already starting to show its age in a bit of a negative way.

Lots of roast in the taste. Lots. Has almost a smokey flavor from all the dark malts. Alcohol is well hidden behind all the roast. Medium viscosity. Each sip clears the pallet well.

1019,"2012-11-29",4.5,"Location: 12 oz bottle from jcos, 11/27/12, Rating # 2600!


Aroma: It is roasty and sweet, with coffee, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and hoppy undertones

Appearance: It pours a thick, dark brown-black color with a small medium brown head

Flavor: The taste is a little bit less sweet then the nose would have suggested, theres still quite a bit of roast, with a little smoke, and it finishes roast, and medium bitter, with just a little bit of booze

Palate: The body is medium-full, it is creamy and smooth, has a fairly soft (leaning toward average) carbonation, a touch of heat (but remains dangerously drinkable at 10.5%), and has a long, dry finish

Overall Impression: 
Thanks Kramer!  I cant believe I havent rated this one before, but this is a heck of a beer.  They figured out how to meld the roast, smoke, sweet malts, and hop bitterness together pretty much perfectly to make a world class beer.  What else is there to say?  This beer is great!","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Deep caramels and velvety chocolate. Palate is heavily viscous. Very enjoyable. Overall, let it sit awhile and mellow, the sugars are pretty complex and do well with a slight age. Lovely stout.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","burgy"

Taste:  medium sweet and medium bitter.  maybe a bit of mild sour.  coffee and chocolate flavors coming out now.

Overall:  This is a great imperial stout.  I am trying to compare this to founders breakfast stout for my personal notes and I feel like the aromas and taste are better on the expedition stout but the higher alcohol and the fact i can sense it brings it down a bit.  The Breakfast stout hid the alcohol well and had a better mouthfeel but had less flavors/aromas.  Either way they are both outstanding and I dont think i can pick a favorite.

1019,"2012-03-01",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/26/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Batch 9435 (Nov. 11, 2009). Part of a side by side with Great Lakes Blackout Stout and Storm King.

This pours a thick mahogany color all the way through, with a surprisingly ruby and brown head that is creamy and huge. Solid retention, and lace splatters all over the glass.

This actually has sort of a subdued aroma. Raisins, espresso, roasted malt, cocoa, and a bit of spicy hops.

The taste flows so well together it confounds me. It starts with light chocolate and espresso flavors, which slowly build over the sip, but they encounter anise, sweet molasses, and roasted malt, before finally encountering some spicy and lightly earthy hops. The ABV sneaks through toward the end, impressive consider it is 10.5%. The finish has more espresso and a bit of molasses. The lingering aftertaste is a coffee bitterness.

There is a syrupy quality to this, but damn is it silky smooth. I cannot remember ever having a beer with this kind of silky feel. Syrupy, chewy, and very full bodied. 

With how insanely silky smooth this stout is, the taste could be bottle sludge and I would love it. Ok, maybe thats a little bit much, but the taste is damn solid. This beer definitely deserves its accolades.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Aroma: Smells of roasted malt, raisins, chocolate, and anise.

Appearance:  Dark tan two finger head, oily black beneath.

Taste: Slight chocolate roasted malt finishing in a pleasant burnt light caramel sweetness accented by the heat from the abundant alcohol.

1019,"2012-02-23",4.4,"Only brewed in the fall & winter of each year, this is one of Bells Brewerys most absolute potent stouts, and it has the flavor to back it up. I had my first taste of Expedition last October and I have been in heavy search of it wherever I go since. Dark and complex, this is a near-perfect beer (aside from some of the bitter aftertaste) that will delight the senses.

Pours the blackest black (super dark ruby if you can catch it in the light), with hardly any head: some brown that settles quickly to nothing. Nose is powerful: molasses, dark roast, some of the licorice, toffee, slight vanilla, chocolate, and some toast. Taste is nice and sweet but balanced. Palate is big, velvetty, smooth, sticky, solid. Ive had this fresh and the big hop bitterness and alcohol heat have subsided considerably after aging. I mean, hell, this is stellar.

To me the mouthfeel is kind of airy, does not coat the mouth like other imperial stouts I have had. Taste of roasted malt and alcohol. I really did not like it as much. Cant really explain why. I will let the other bottles I have sit for a couple of years and try it again. Should be better, I hope.

Faint nose of roasty coffee and dark chocolate flows into that first delightful sip:  thick malty liquid coats your tongue and brings forth flavors of rich chocolate, a hint of coffee and the tingling of citrus fruits.  Finish is long and strong and down to get the friction on.  Perfectly balanced and a body that could make a black malt blush.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","EHouse"

The morning after RBAG 2012 I just woke up and was cleaning up the house after hosting about 10 of Albertas finest citizens for what I am sure is one of the most magnificent beer tastings to ever happen in Wild Rose Country. I had a pot of coffee on the go and commented to Kyle that it was a shame some real gems would be going home unopened. Kyles generous response was to pop the cap off his Bells Expedition. So this became my breakfast and the perfect way to see off a very successful inaugural Ratebeer Alberta Gathering. Pours a midnight black with virtually no head. Surprisingly the head grew as it settled to a little less than a finger. The aroma is laced with dark chocolate, espresso, and charred firewood. The flavor has chocolate, a hint of vanilla and lots of dark roasted characteristics. The mouth feel is basically perfect. An excellent overall beer even if Im drinking it a little cool.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

Chocolate, roasted coffee beans, resin, floral notes, dark dried fruits, and soy sauce are all present in the aroma.  The head actually rose several seconds after the pour ceased, a frothy brown pillow that took several minutes to recede.  The ale itself is deep brown, bordering on black.  Aromas are revisited upon tasting, which begins sweet but quickly turns bitter from what I presume is substantial hopping.  There may be some of that umami thing going on, as well.  It glides across the tongue effortlessly, full bodied, creamy, thick and sticky, it is softly carbonated, and finishes long and bitter.","Saint John, Indiana, USA","HoppyAlesToYou"

Not so easily drinkable as the KBS for instance but definitely enjoyable. unbelievably the booziness remains almost hidden in the background

1019,"2011-10-29",4.4,"Amazing coffee and chocolate aromas, roast malts, coffee, caramel, rich and slightly sweet, touch of booze.  Pours inky black, massive tan/brown head with great retention, leaves plenty of lacing.  Flavor is near perfection - rich malt and chocolate with moderate sweetness, balanced with just the right amount of hop bitterness, alcohol, and carbonation to keep it from being overly sweet.  Roast and coffee with minimal astringency, velvety chocolate flavors are outstanding, a bit of warm alcohol in the finish.  Full body, medium carbonation, silky mouthfeel.

1019,"2011-10-25",3.9,"The following review is of a 2 year old bottle

Aroma is of molasses, burnt sugar and tons of roasted malt. Also some prune/fig and a hint of soy sauce. Finishes with a bit of hops and some alcohol but the aging helps damper that. 

Appearance is pretty lackluster. When first poured, produced about half inch head but quickly disappeared. Body is pitch black and lacing never appeared.

Taste is pretty good. First flavors are sweet molasses, burnt malt and some espresso.  For almost 11 percent, alcohol is present, nice and warming almost like a port wine but not as complex. Finishes with some chocolate covered raisins and slight bitterness.

Palate is above average. Carbonation is good, just enough to level out the thickness of the beer making it not so syrupy. Only complaint is that there was no head throughout the beer which is a pet peeve of mine.

Overall this is a pretty good beer. Wasnt overly impressed with it when I tried a 10 month old version acouple years ago, but two years aging definitely smoothed it out. Too bad its not available in Colorado, not quite good enough to go outta my way and trade for it.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"
1019,"2011-10-15",4.1,"Served on-tap at Als of Hampden into a nonic pint.
A - Pours dark as can be with a thick, pillowy, one finger head, dissipating down to a thick film of head, leaving thick rings of lacing down the glass.
S - Rich, chocolatey, nose with a bit of lightly roasted dark malt. Chocolate is quite bitter but not to the point of being overpowering. A bit on the sweeter side compared to others in the style. More and more roast comes thru as it begins to warm.
T - Lots of dark, roasty, flavors in this one. Plenty of bitter chocolate up front giving way slowly to a mix of sweetness and rich roasty malt. Finish is very roasty that lingers long after consumption. Alcohol is ever present, unable to hide in the shadows for long, offering a warming sensation on finish. Not the best I have had but still very nice.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Fairly creamy feel with a very nice balance of flavors.
D - Fairly high. I really like this one a lot but it can become overpowering after the first glass. I could have one or two of these but that would be about all.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Pours a nice silky black with off white head. The nose is hoppy and malty when fresh and malty to bready when aged. When fresh I do not find this beer to be at its best, if really seems to balance out IMO after about 8-18 months.

Flavour is packed with dark chocolate along with some smooth coffee notes, a bit of caramel and a hint of red berries. Medium-strong but smooth roastiness that follows through from the first sip to long after youve finished the beer. Theres a very quick notion of chocolatey sweetness before the roasty bitterness takes over completely and builds up itself. There is no alcohol in the flavour whatsoever, only a very slight warming sensation which makes this beer very drinkable. I still took over an hour to finish a 12 oz bottle but only because I wanted the goodness to last for as long as possible.

1019,"2011-08-11",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2015 The beer pours a deep black and develops no more than a finger of milk-chocolate head. The aroma is massive amounts of chocolate and bold hoppage. For a beer whose ABV is in the double digits, the Expedition Stout restrains its own alcohol character so well that, were it not for the warming sensation you get a few minutes after you drink the whole thing, you wouldnt even know you were drinking alcohol. The taste is bitter and sour, with some sweet character coming from the exquisite chocolate notes. The hops and the roasted malts really come through, but the protagonist here is the chocolate. The palate is extremely creamy, with soft, delicate carbonation and a thick body that doesnt feel oilyjust extremely pleasant. As the beer goes down, surprisingly, the alcohol doesnt show upits just bitter and delicious, and it leaves a sour sensation all over your mouth. Quite an intense brew, more so than many other impy stouts. I love it and wish Bells distributed it to Texas.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Poured exactly how you would expect an Imperial stout to look.  The taste was very rich with a surprisingly nutty finish.  There was something a bit off to me about the taste.  I got a strange buttery flavor and not much roasted character.  Im looking forward to trying my second bottle to see if I had a bottle that was a bit off.  I still enjoyed it just a bit less then expected.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

Thick, rich, and 400 calories a bottle, Expedition Stout is a meal in and of itself, a chunky and viscous of a beer as you can find.  Chocolate and coffee and dried cherries meet up somewhere in the middle of a field of toasty hops.  I think.

1019,"2011-05-04",4.4,"This one was a nice find, poured from a bottle. Id have to say this is the thickest pour I have ever seen. It was very dark, looked slick even, like liquid tar. There was no head, but little lacing. For an imperial stout it smelled very sweet, not too bitter. There were notes of coffee, coco nibs, perhaps even maple. The sweet half of the scent made it smell like a caramel cappuccino. The first sip was intense, the carbonation and thickness seemed to lengthen the flavor. Instantly it tastes like a cold coffee, but then is washed away with sweet chocolaty malt and the warmth of the generous ABV. As the carbonation leaves your mouth, you are left with a taste of dark chocolate, and your lips sticky (if you enjoyed it as much as me). This beer is very complex and enjoyable, goes down hard, yet smooth at the same time.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"

Let me also say, that this is my favorite beer ever. Not because its the best beer I have ever had, but because its the best accessible beer. Its also pretty darn amazing. The appearance is luscious, dark, with a towering cream to tan colored head that leaves some pretty good lace, if you have the right touch with the pour. Aroma ranges from rich dark chocolate and vanilla extract, to graham cracker smores, to roast. Some of the newer bottles can have a bit of olive, which is why I suggest aging this one a bit. Taste is incredible with more of the chocolate smore taste. Roast, sometimes some caramel, vanilla extract. Palate is awesome. Thick, oily, rich, full-bodied. Everything I want in my stout.

Lalcool me semble bien en retrait derrière la somptuosité du liquide.  Les saveurs abondent dans le même sens : les grains foncés laissent beaucoup de mélasse aux papilles tandis que des saveurs de fruits émergent dans un subtil fracas.  Les houblons sont en sourdine.  On pourrait croire quil sagit dune bouteille qui a été mise au cellier.  La sensation en bouche est exceptionnelle.  Une incroyable réalisation architecturale : son corps est solide, lourdement charpenté.  Sa douce effervescence est parfaite, capable de souligner lintensité des flaveurs.  Sa texture est onctueuse, un peu collante, englobante, palpable.  La finale est un spectacle sensoriel, le réveil dune amertume chaude et chocolatée qui sinstalle longuement et majestueusement derrière la langue.  Colossal et intense.

Aroma is strong, very strong, a little boozy. Almost liquor like in aroma. Very strong. Pretty sweet. Its a little bit of a turnoff.

Very full bodied stout, finishes brighter than it starts. Pretty roasty, kind of bourbony in the mouthfeel and forward flavors. Its a big big beer. I didnt realize the ABV on this until I started writing this review foolishly. I will pay for my ignorance for sure. Its pretty drinkable especially if Im grading on a curve. I had the 2005 recently, also a gift from Huhzubendah and it had began to turn. Strong plum flavors and other characteristic oxidized notes in the palate.

Batch 9971 POured an almost black body, only slightly tinged with red and a brown, relatively big head that went away, again, relatively slowly. The nose was, as expected, strong and aromatic, slightly sticky coffeish and sweet but with an unfortunate ethanol note. The taste started of similarly and I was left doubting the sanity of people who took this to 4.3s.  Treacley mouthfeel, full, sweet maltiness but with a strong clear alcohol hit, later balanced on with some notes of orange turning into a roasty finish. As it got warmed it definitely got better though, and I grew to respect the beer, that persistant presence of orange keeping the soft mouthfeel fighting with the roastiness at bay... And then the alcohol hit gain. And it was gone. An ever so sligthly crude hoppy bitter profile formed in the finish and in the aftertaste.... Man,  I do respect this beer and its definitely good stuff. Only it wouldve been great stuff if not for random strikes of alcohol, which I just dont like. No, which I just hate in my beers. The batch is fairly fresh (13.9.2010), so I guess we shouldve waited some more time, and Id just love to try an aged bottle to try. As it is right now, I liked their other stout better and this just didnt sit with me right. Yes, I will rerate one day. One. Day.

Appearance : Pitch syrupy black with almost no head. No lacing.

Palate : Very soft, almost flat but still a nice smooth fizz. Velvety and pillowy. Body is oily and sweet but not cloying. Some dryness that might be the result of the ageing. So smooth and creamy. This is one of the best mouthfeel Ive ever experienced. Oily.

Taste : Chocolate, coffee, coffee spices, burnt caramel. Resinous hops. Finish is very persistent with oily resinous hops notes with coffee and chocolate. Quite hoppy.

I would rate that bottle 4.5 and maybe over but Im just going to bring my original rating up from 4.0 to 4.2

Overall : Ok this is a big guy. Very complex nose, nice coffee, nice molasses and rich sweetness mixed with the resinous hops. A bit too much licorice for my taste (quite sensible to this). Finish is very nice and complex. Rather well balance even if quite powerful. Carbonation could be a tad more present. Im sure I dont appreciate this as much as many because Im not such a big fan of licorice... Still I can appreciate the complexity and I find a lot of great flavours all around. Maybe a fresh bottle would be more hops and less licorice...Rating 2011-03-17 8,2,8,3,19;4.0","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

A: Pours dark as night with a tan milky head that, after dissipating, leaves a nice tan film over the beer. Same colored lacing on the glass.

S: You get a ton of roasted malt from this. I cant smell the espresso, but the chocolate is evident. You can smell the alcohol a bit, too.

T: Almost tastes like a boozy chocolate milk at first. Finishes with a little bitterness from the roasted malts that were in the smell. A little bit of burn from the ABV.

M: Very creamy and smooth. There is a bit of carbonation, but it does nothing but enhance and deliver the creaminess.

D: You dont want to drink this quickly not just b/c of the high ABV, but b/c it tastes so damn good. I couldnt believe this was 10.5%. You can taste the booze, but I had no idea it was that high. This could be a dangerous one.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","joshrosborne"
1019,"2011-02-21",3.8,"12 oz bottle purchased from the Bells General Store.

Pours into my pint a dark black with slight ruby edges when held to light. The head is thick and creamy and large. It is brown/tan and leaves thick lacing behind.

SMell is very carmally, also some molasses, nuts, maple, brown sugar, coffee, and cocoa.

Mouthfeel is extra thick but the alcohola nd slight carbonation do bite the lips. It tastes chocolatey and fruity, with a definite alcohol bite. It is pretty sweet and bittersweet but it doesnt reach cloying levels. This is one of those big ass beers that you drink to warm up. They could have bumped it up to 12% though considering the strength of the alcohol already on the palate.

This is a big and bold Russian imperial stout, but for a true Michigan jewel I recommend the Dark Horse Plead the 5th.

Flavor of smooth dark roasted malts with nice bittersweet chocolate, some earthy dark coffee, molasses, and some noticeable semi-sweet fruity hops (but not bitter).

Smell: Chocolate, molasses, alcohol and a hops.

1019,"2010-12-27",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2012 12oz bottle, batch 9459, bottled Nov 19, 2009.  Over a year old.  Served cellar temp in a New Belgium globe/snifter.  Ive enjoyed this a few times in its youth but wanted to wait to review til it was over a year old.  Pours black with a two finger brown head that leaves some pretty lacing and holds a small cap.  Aroma is rich roasted malts, chocolate, anise, coffee, vanilla, dark fruits of plums, figs, cherries, and raisins, some alcohol.  Great strength.  Flavor is also very rich much like the aroma with chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, cherries, plums, figs, raisins, vanilla, there is still a noticeable alcohol bite/burn which is to be expected for the ABV but I thought it would have diminished more over a years time.  Still, cant really fault a big Imperial Stout for being a touch hot.  Mouthfeel is full, creamy, medium carbonation.  A world-class Imperial Stout for sure, so very rich and decadent.  Cant wait to try some of the 2010 batch.

EDIT: By FAR my favorite non-barrel aged Imperial Stout. Just cant get enough of this magical brew. Numerous batches, numerous years at a variety of ages and theyre all fantastic in their own way.

Great Beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","bth122"

Taste is a wonderully thick blend of roasted malt, bakers chocolate, cream, nuttiness, espresso malt. Lingering finish with the slightest bit of hop bitterness. This is a deep, dark stout, but it is creamy. Pretty good beer, but missing something to elevate it to elite level. At its best with age, without a doubt.","Florida, USA","FudgeSociety2"
1019,"2010-12-16",3.7,"Bottle: poured a dark, almost oddly glossy black with a 1/4"" fast-dissipating chocolate head. Aroma of roasty malts, grain, molasses, and chalk.
Flavor is very dark and somewhat sweet with the roasted malts giving way to 
the slightly hoppy finish. Tastes somewhat like toffee and chestnuts. 
A very dark and complex stout, would fare much better if aged a couple years. A great stout if youre looking for something off the beaten path, but not developed enough to be the best stout. Cellaring may be the answer.","Alabama, USA","theaudist"
1019,"2010-12-14",4.5,"Pours pitch black with a dark brown full head.  The smell just fills the room once the cap has been cracked...phenomenal.  Rich aromas of bourbon, tobacco, sweet and bitter dark chocolate, copious amounts of coffee.  There is also a bit of a hoppy bite in the aroma.  The flavor is just spot on.  Rich oily mouthfeel gives flavors that are close to the nose.  Bitter roasted coffee and dark chocolate are the most accessible flavors with those heavily roasted malts coming across with such brilliance.  Tobacco and toffee combine with molasses to give an incredible complexity.  This beer also has that raw edge that I love in stouts so much.  The finish is long, dry, and lingering.

1019,"2010-11-29",4.3,"12 oz. bottle from Johns Grocery, Iowa City

Ar:  Exceptionally complex.  Not as much coffee up front as I expected.  The flavor leans more on deep dried fruit flavors than other Impy Stouts Ive had.  The alcohol is prevalent, but is masked by date, black fig, coffee, and bitter chocolate.
Ap:  Wow is this gorgeous.  It pours an oil black with a thick 1"" head of beautiful cinnamon bubbles.  The head sticks around for quite some time too.  This is the kind of beer you just want to look at for some time before drinking.  Great lace as well.  This is absolute beer porn.
T: Light black fig and molasses up front, with a significant malt sweetness.  Coffee and bitter chocolate dominate the heavily bittered finish.
P:  Exceptionally thick, creamy body with mild carbonation.  The viscous body coats every part of my mouth, and distributes flavors exceptionally well.

O:  What more is there to be said about this beer that hasnt already been said?  This is awesome.  Phenomenally complex, phenomenally rich, and drop dead gorgeous.  The aroma is just a bit confusing, but given a few years the flavors would probably meld together.  Thats just a nitpick though.  Simply put, this is without a doubt one of the five best beers I have ever had, and its less than $18 for a sixer.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","spilledpint"

This poured thick, viscous, and reddish-black into a snifter, with a single thin line of foam that reduced to the tiniest of lines of lace.

The pour is motor oil black with a huge brown head that slowly recedes, leaving thick lace both on the beer and the inside of the glass.  The nose is molasses and bitter dark chocolate with a slight coconut creaminess, vanilla, and espresso grounds.  There is just a bit of oxidation beginning to show with a just a hint of nuttiness and soy beginning to peak through.  The flavor starts off sweet with the molasses, vanilla, and coconut, but it is balanced very well with bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and a resinous hops flavor.  The body is massive, thick, and sticky with average carbonation, and a super long, molasses sweet and bitter coffee finish.

Lots of flavors here...starts with great dark malt, coco, a bit of coffee, fading to dark fruit, followed by a big hit of hop bitterness.  Some warming alcohol on the end detracts a bit.

The aroma has an up-front alcohol character that seems like a licorice liqueur along with some underlying sweetness. The flavor is roasy, sweet, and almost tangy, featuring the same licorice character found in the aroma, with complementing characteristics of charred firewood and bitter chocolate.

1019,"2010-11-01",4.5,"I have previously stated that Samuel Smiths and Old Rasputin were my favorite imperial Stouts, and while I dont totally retract that statement, I do recognize that I forgot to account for Expedition Stout becoming the father in my imperial holy trinity. This stuff is serious. Poured black as night into a snifter, and was amazed that absolutely no light could penetrate the darkness. It was totally opaque. The head was full and left wonderful trails. I had refrigerated the bottle, but let the poured Expedition breathe in the snifter for a few minutes before drinking. The flavor blew me away. The first word that comes to mind is dark. Dark dark dark, and heavy as can be. This is not for the faint of heart, but for anyone who carries an appreciation for the imperial stout, this is nothing short of mana. I would recommend savoring one of these at a time and leaving at least a couple from the six pack or whatever to age in refrigeration. I drink most stouts at room temperature but this one actually packs more flavor than most stouts in prime drinking conditions while still being quite cool. Brilliant.

A-Pours a thick creamy dark brown head that is quite large, i did pour aggressively and it went crazy. the color of the beer is jet black and even a mag-lite cant get a shimmer of light through. the head has solid retention and is slowly leaving huge lace on the glass. this is an amazing looking beer.

S-the nose is very light and im not getting a lot. i get the typical smells of some roasted malt, hints of molasses and a faint touch of dark chocolate with some medicinal alcohol notes and some sweet citrus coming in last.

T-the taste starts of with the roasted malt and then fades to some molasses flavor accompanied by dark chocolate, a sweetness comes in next with some dark cherry blended with citrus finishing slightly bitter

M-not huge body but it is relatively full, extremely smooth and very low levels of carbonation. a slight, very slight, burning of alcohol on the back of the throat but the alcohol is extremely well hidden.

D-very tasty and well hidden alcohol. nothing huge here so it isnt a top RIS; but definitely a solid choice.

Tasting of the same batch on 10/30/10

S-the nose is nice, extremely malty, lots of roasty malts, molasses, rich chocolate rum cake, hints of licorice light bit of booze.

Anyway, no worries. This beer is simply amazing. Rivals the best of the best Imperials (Stone, Yeti, Speedway, TenFidy). Reminds me of Yeti more than anything else with the initial blast of hops then tempered with roasted malt, and even the sweeter rum-soaked raisin aspect (many ""good"" stouts have one or the other, but not all these aspects. perfectly balanced here, with a warming, but not ""hot"" finish. full and smooth.

A - Deep dark black with a large creamy, frothy, thick, meringue-like, dark tan head. Really good retention that settles into a nice thick, creamy lace.

S - Good amount of chocolate and some black coffee. Roasted malt is very prominent. Some dark fruit tartness and hints of licorice and soy aroma. Some caramel as well. Tartness is fairly strong (for the style).

T - Rich and fairly complex flavors. Dark chocolate and roasted malt are the strongest flavors. Has some burnt sugar and coffee flavors as well. Some dark fruit, although none really stand out much. Also a bit of anise and soy. The tartness in the aroma is also there and mixes along with some roasted bitterness. Alcohol heat is also present. Usually the tartness is toward the beginning of the taste with more of the chocolate and burnt flavors and alcohol mid to finish of the sip. Hints of citrus hops in there.

M - Full thick feel with a good amount of carbonation. Very thick and creamy feel.

D - A little much to want to drink a lot or to have it on a regular basis. Very much a sipper, with the alcohol heat and slight tartness and bitterness making it a bit less drinkable. Wasnt quite as balanced as I would have liked.

Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown head that leaves an incredible lacing. Color is dark dark brown, almost black.

Smell is a toasted malted chocolate. Very toasty that is. Taste is quite similar very very chocolaty. It also tastes like something was burnt. Some dark fruit notes in there. Maybe some coffee as well.

Mouthfeel is very smooth, just a little crisp. After it lingers around enough, the 10.5% abv shows. Full bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.

Overall, this is a great RIS. Not too expensive for a 6er and at 10.5% you really cant go wrong. I will be getting this every year. If you see this at the stores, do yourself a favor and buy some!

Smell: Roasted malt that gives off a hint of coffee, some vanillia, and a wood note stand out. The notes are there but are not the most pronounced. You have to dig for them a bit.

Taste: I get bread pudding, roasted malt, some dark chocolate (but nothing like Choklat from Southern Tier), and a hint of anise. Better than the nose!

Mouthfeel: A full bodied brew that is a touch thick and a little flat. I think more carbonation would help in this category and this is the least impressive category for ES so far.

UPDATE 11/29/09: Ive since had this brew several more times and have found more recent samplings to have better carbonation so Im changing my score from a 3.5 to 4.0

Drinkability: Tastes great and is fairly drinkable for a full bodied low carbonation brew.

Thankfully, Iowa beer legislation has changed and we can now bring in great beers like Expedition Stout. I didnt wait for my beer to get completely cold before I decided to drink it, and I think that really helped bring out the aroma. This stouts aroma really shows off its malt and hops. It seduces you with promises of indulgent, dirty, no holds barred frolic. My beer poured golden black with a fine but rich head. It is pleasantly bitter, mellowed only by a bourbon / oak woodiness. Full of body and the finish lingers like low voltage a/c running through your mouth. Great beer!","Des Moines, Iowa, USA","salvinian"
1019,"2010-05-13",4.9,"This offering from Bells is absolutely one of the best, if not the best stout I have ever had.  You can easily taste roasted malt and a great, sweet vanilla flavor throughout the whole beer.  In my opinion my friend and fellow beer taster hit the nail on the head when he described this beer as ""beer candy.""  This brew definitely deserves all the praise it receives and it wasnt even all that expensive either!  I will surely come back to this stout as many times as i can.","Pennsylvania, USA","CaptainTitus"

1019,"2010-04-28",4.2,"First time trying this, and I havent had too many stouts yet, although I look forward to trying more.  Anyway, this is a thick, black beer with a rather thin, dark tan head.  It was initially a little too cold, but as it warmed up more of the flavors came out.  The previous reviews talk enough about the aroma and flavor, so I dont have much to add there.  It is a good tasting beer, a good one to drink slowly so you can appreciate the new flavors that come out as it goes through temperature changes.  Not as bitter as I thought it would be.  I think it is a good stout, not overpowering.  I was gonna try GI BCS tonight, but was afraid it would be stronger than what I was in the mood for, so I went with this one instead and it was a good choice.

Smells like roasted nuts, caramel, coffee, and a little bit of bourbon. The taste is powerful, sweet, and well supported by the thickness of the brew. Its a mix of bittersweet chocolate, caramel, some oak, a nice hint of sourness from the malt, and some alcohol. Finishes thick and a little bitter--coats the mouth so you must drink more. Not quite as overpowering as Bourbon County Stout, making it a little easier to keep drinking.","Minnesota, USA","brosen561"

Heavy on the palate, but very smooth.  Feels lively and dense at the same time.

Nose is fantastic like a rich chocolate dessert with some slightly roasted coffee notes around the edges.  Flavor has a bit of everything and is what sets this beer apart from most.  First taste is mildly sweet with strong chocolate malt flavor that is quickly followed by a strong dose of bittering hops and a dry, roasted and astringent coffee flavor.  Some subtle tobacco, ash and vanilla lurking beneath the roasted malts.  Texture is slick, creamy and utterly fantastic.  Finish is long, relatively dry and roasty.

1019,"2010-03-11",4.0,"Ive never been a big fan of the Russian Imperial Stout style because I often find the intense potency tends to overwhelm the palette and makes it difficult to appreciate. Then along comes Bells Expedition Stout - a midwestern example that impressed me more than all other previous examples of the style put together. Its got everything I look for in a great stout: smooth, creamy texture; prominent chocolate and deeply roasted barley notes and its quite drinkable. APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. This beer has a body that could only be described as opaque jet black. Even the head is very dark brown. Its creamy and surprisingly thick for an imperial brew. It lasts for the first few swigs, dies down, but regenerates easily with a quick swirl. The aroma is more along the lines of a chocolate stout with bitter dark chocolate notes as well as a significant alcohol presence. Its surprisingly mild for such a strong beer. TASTEI noticed three separate, but very noticeable, flavor components to Bells Expedition Stout. Up front the beer is thick, creamy, smooth and chocolaty. As it finishes theres quite a bit of heat from the alcohol which is rather dry, but completely tolerable. The aftertaste is almost as strong as the mouthfeel itself with a strong flavor of deeply roasted, or even burnt malts along with dark chocolate. Now thats what I consider a complex palette.What I like about this beer is the fact there is no sour red grape taste and the fact the chocolate is more on the bitter side so as not to be overly sweet the way some straight-up chocolate stouts tend to be. The alcohol is probably a little more prominent than Id prefer, but it actually seems to fade away as the beer warms (usually, the opposite is true of beers like this). I just wish the roasted malts had been more pronounced, since it this flavor was very pleasing on the tongue in the aftertaste. DRINKABILITYWhat impressed me most about Bells Expedition Stout (relatively speaking) was the how creamy and smooth the beer felt in the mouth. As it first enters the mouth, its velvety like a nitrogen-charged session stout but without the watery body. Its thick, but not sticky or heavy. Its sweet, but not overly sweet like candy or a dessert beer. Even though alcohol is quite prominent on the finish its actually rather subdued compared to other beers of the style.Weighing in at 10.5% ABV its not surprising how much heat is generated from the beer, but what is surprising is how hefty the beer is not. Sure, just one bottle gave me a noticeable buzz, but I didnt feel as though I had a watermelon in my stomach the way some imperials make me feel.FINAL THOUGHTSWhile I wouldnt consider Bells Expedition Stout among the best of the best, its quite an amazing beer for what its able to accomplish. Its rare Im able to get such enjoyable taste and true drinkability in a Russian imperial stout. (note: this beer was sent to me from a friend in Michigan since its not yet distributed here in upstate New York. Im not sure of the price, but I would say upwards of $15 for a 4-pack is a good value.)NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsxB9FHMA_c","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Very clear with each item separated, but not deviated.  Taste is a heavy smack across the palate. Thick, chewy, yet silky and smooth. The first bite is sharp, evening out into an artists palette , with dabs of chocolate, molasses, coffee (colombian), clove, more chocolate, more coffee, a nice abundance of hopes, and some sugar and spice for measure. Vanilla notes lead into frequent earth tones and at some point I felt as though I was describing a wine. No real off-setting areas, other than maybe a tad too sweet. But damn, I hope I can find something like this over here in Germany","Brooklyn, New York, USA","BeerBlockaid"
1019,"2010-02-03",4.5,"12 oz bottle, $17 for a six pack at Total Wine.    Its been a long time coming to Jacksonville, but here it is.  I have searched high and low for this beer for years.   Poured into my CASK Brewclub pint shaker glass.  Small skim of a brown head that doesnt last long, on a deep black beer.   Aroma  of coffee, chocolate, licorice, and molasses... smells great!  I got a sense of deja vu on the smell.  Taste is almost too much to take in at once.  Bursting with flavor... heavy on roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, licorice, molasses, sweet dark malts, and hops throughout.   Very thick and heavy to drink, a real sipper.   The intense flavor completely covers the 10.5% abv, cant even tell its there until you get a buzz.   The realization hit me like a hammer.. I brewed a beer like this 3 years ago and thought I had ruined it by loading it up with too much malts and hops and molasses and other stuff, until it matured about a year later, and then it tasted fabulous.  I still have about a case.  Larry Bell and I think alike on Imperial Stouts!    World class beer worth the wait.","Orange Park, Florida, USA","yayforbeer"
1019,"2010-02-02",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2010 Pours deep black, yes opaque black, with tan head that is similar to espresso crema.  Nose has some chocolate and fresh baked brown bread aromas.

Flavor shows the same and is joined by underlying notes of roasted nuts and vanilla.  Overall body is moderate-full and carbonation is soft.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden and only shows moderately on the tail end tagging along with the hops.

1019,"2010-01-28",4.4,"12 oz bottle. Been waiting for the right occasion/celebration to rate this one for awhile now. So today seemed like a good day. This one has definitely been pretty consistent in its quality (probably the forth occasion drinking it), and this one is no exception. Right from the first whiff, you can tell this is something special. Very robust, yet not over imposing, the deep roasted amaretto nutty caramel cereal grains with nice hints of coffee beans, vanilla, and oaky scotch are near mesmerizing. I really could hold this one up to my nose all day without getting bored. The pour is dark, thick, and black. The layer of thick creamy head was reddish brown in color. Its quite sinister looking. Good body overall as well, somewhat boozy through the finish and not as thick feeling on the way down as maybe you would think. The flavor profile might also be a bit more simplistic then I was imagining too, but never the less, very tasty. Roasted nuts and rich malts are all around, nothing overly sweet and well balanced without a strong hop profile (maybe a minor bit of herbal in there), some caramel sugars, light oak, vanilla and coffee. So really the flavors match the aroma quite nicely. To me though, the aroma comes just comes together a tad more perfectly. This is really isnt too far off from an imperial Kalamazoo in my opinion. Definitely world class.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

1019,"2010-01-11",3.2,"Ive been trying to get into stouts for a little while now and thus, this was a very coveted beer for me. Thankfully a friend bought me a 6 pack for Christmas. Aroma was very nice. I cant say the appearance of the liquid was great as its just solid black however the head is a pretty cool tan color with a nice lace (P.S. dont spill any on the carpet...). Complex taste. Sweet and delicious when its in your mouth, but just SO damn hoppy and bitter when swallowed. Since I dont necessarily like bitterness to the point where my face scrunches, I rated the taste down a bit. If youre ino an absolutely ridiculous amount of bittery hops, then youd give the tatse a 10. Ive got 4 more bottles in my wine fridge.

The beer leaves a little lace on the glass but really it leaves more ""sheets"" than anything. The aroma is dark chocolate, plenty of floral hops, some toast, some raisins, plenty of earthy and woody notes, there is some ash and some licorice in there as well. The flavor is woody, like new wood. I wouldnt have been surprised if I found out that this was aged in wood. The beer is very bitter with lots of fruity hop notes and is all around insanely roasty. All of this is comprised of or complimented by flavors of chocolate, licorice, burnt toast, and raw coco. A few things strike me as special and unique about this beer first off it seems to be balanced, but not between bitter and sweet flavors as there isnt a lot of sweetness here, but there is a lot of fruitiness seemingly from the hops, which is kind of wild because this seems to balance the bitterness both from the roasty malt and the copious hop content. The palate is full and big without being syrupy, this beer is a kind of feat. I dont mind syrupy or sweet imperial stouts but this is clearly better than almost if not every single one of those.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1019,"2009-12-14",2.6,"A - Nice think black color with a small head of foam that fades quickly.  Not a lot of lacing.  Lots of yeast sediment in the bottom of the pour.

S - Roasted malts and chocolate at first sniff.  As beer warms starts to smell like playdough, very odd.

T - Dark malts, slight rum flavor, chocolate, not a lot of dark fruit flavors.  A sharp bitterness on the finish from the amount of yeast in the pour.

M - Nice thick/slick mouthfeel.  Not too carbonated (how I like my big stouts).

D - Given the sharp bitterness, this one is not real pleasant to drink.  Certainly not meant to be a sessionable beer, but the sharp bitter flavor really takes away from the overall experience and is hard for the beer to show any complexity with such a dominating force to compete with.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","Peterlemonjelo"

There are also some significant notes of dark chocolate which permeate this beer, and keep it from being overly sweet. Caramel malts also add to the sweetness.

The flavor is initially liquoirce with roasted malts following quickly and then dark chocolate. The alcohol is not evident other than as it warms on the way down, and, in my experience it will disappear in the nose in another year or two. Half way into the snifter and this brew is still releasing carbonation and bringing more aroma to the drink. The palate is smooth with a little hops bite.

Mild notes of dark chocolate and coffee, mix with a large presence of (very) dark roasted malts. A touch of molasses. Sweet notes of brown sugar, with hints of vanilla and caramel. Definite hints of a bourbon-like quality. Light presence of dark fruits.

Huge dark roasted malt profile. Nice amount of smokiness. Loads of chocolate flavor. Sweetness of brown sugar. Light hint of dark coffee. Slight hints of bourbon and hazelnuts. It has a mild bitter kick, right at the end, which helps balance this one out. The aftertaste is delicious.

Silky smooth and creamy. Light level of carbonation, which is perfect for this one. Only the slightest amount of sharpness and bite.

Quite easy for me to drink, but this is the style that I search out. As a sipper, this one is excellent. Be careful of the high ABV, though.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

Not bad, but just not there.  I really couldnt smell much at all until about half way through the beer.  The coffee tones definitely came out and the malts were pretty spectacular.

Poured from bottle into Snifter.

Pitch motor oil black with chocolate covered head that leaves some very spotty lacing behind.

Huge roasted aroma of burnt molasses, semi-sweet chocolate, licorice root, dark fruit and noticeable alcohol.

The roasted malt taste also drifts toward burnt molasses, with some notes of sweet chocolate, anise and coffee. Ends somewhat bitter and with an alcohol kick. Even after aging a year, still seems a trifle raw.

Very thick and chewy. Low carbonation, quite smooth and extremely warming.

A - Pours black with very little tan-colored head. No lacing whatsoever. Looking at it now, all I see is total darkness in my glass. Dont know if Im good with this or not.

S - Coffee, dark chocolate, some nice bitterness. As I take a few more whiffs, its really hard to get a good sense on the nose, dont know what, but I cant get a whole lot from this one.

T - Alcohol, dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, bitterness all melded pretty well together. Maybe a little too much alcohol burn on this right away, but Im digging the other flavors afterwards. Pretty dry finish, bitter aftertaste with some chocolate notes. Too much booze for me, needs some cellar time to chill out.

M - Just about right for me with enough fizzy carbonation to satisfy. I would say medium bodied, but a very ""light"" medium. Def better then the Bourbon Barrel Aged Cherry Stout I just had.

D - I like this one, but if I had to choose a regularly available RIS, Id take an Old Rasputin RIS any day of the week. Will drink again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

Some alcohol. Flavour is massive, much roastiness, loads of espresso, figs or prunes, and a sold cocoa bitterness and warming alcohol finish.

1019,"2009-11-10",4.3,"Bottle.

A pitch black and viscous beer with a small brown head that actually shows some retention. Nice lacings. 

The smell is big, powerful and intense. Lots of everything - hardly roasted malts, cocoa, espresso, wood. Perhaps a hint of vanilla. The alcohol is nicely integrated with the other aromas. 

And the flavors dont disappoint either. Theres lots of roasted malts in the mouth, coupled with notes of bitter chocolate and musty espresso. Hints of dark fruits ease up the otherwise heavy character. The finish is very bitter with lots of bitter hop notes, some alcohol, wood and licorice.  

The mouthfeel is outstanding - a nearly spotless balance of big body, creamy texture and gentle carbonation. 

This is a really good beer. Bold character, intense and massive. My only objection is that the bitterness is perhaps a bit too generous as it gets slightly overpowering after a while.","Malme, SWEDEN","ricke"

Was going to say there was no head at all, but I turned my head and 5 seconds later there was a cm-thick, rich brown head that dissipated relatively quickly. Aroma is plums, prunes, raisins, coffee, cinnamon. Flavors similar with a very roasted malt character, very sweet. High in flavor, even very cold, and about as viscous a mouthfeel as Ive experienced. Id prefer less syrupy. Aftertaste is where the alcohol is, and where the roasty is. Had it with a creamy roasted potato soup and a wedge of gruyere, and I can hardly think of a more robust trio. Strangely, none overpowered the other. I like it.",", New Jersey, USA","pressboxjoe"

1019,"2009-10-17",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2011 Smells like someone figured out how to make saturated dark chocolate coffee milk. With strong bitter hops and a healthy alcohol burn, it starts better than it finishes.  First thing on my tongue is molasses; after that comes a heavy malt sweetness with raw bakers cocoa and a deep dark rum-like alcohol burn and a finish of heavy bitters.  Mouthfeel is full, heavy, dense, slightly oily and coating and every other adjective you can use for a luxurious palate with sticky lips to follow.  Legendary brew, would be fascinating to sample barrel aged.  Thank You Bells. 2009 12 oz.         
          With two years on it, this puppy has mellowed on the bitter hop front considerably.  That maturation has brought into the forefront an essence of a truly great dessert beer.

The flavour is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, very long finish with medium to heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic.

Alcohol is sweet on the nose mixing well with the caramel and toffee that is drizzled over the chocolate. Just a touch of fresh ground coffee sprinkled on top. Hmm, now I am hungry. As it warms up biscuit and toasted brown bread start to come through and some of the sweetness blows off. No astringent bitter roast or minerally and ashy coffee as with many of this style... and that is good. Full bodied and creamy thick on the tongue. Sweet toffee, with tons of chocolate run rampant around your mouth. Sweet alcohols and herbal hop bitterness then swoop down and tame the sweetness. Roast is more apparent in the mouth than on the nose. Some slight charcoal mixed with bitter bakers chocolate. Long bitter herb and chocolate finish riding a sugary vein. The chocolate notes are quite nice and multi-layered. It is definitely a good candidate for long term aging. For me this is a bit sweet and the alcohol can stick out a bit too much. Given some time that would round out quite nicely. Guess Ill have to re-rate when there is some more age on it.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

Looks like it is flat as a pancake and then explodes with residual carbonation at the last second...had a very tasty mess. Pours with a humongous chocolate brown head and an aroma that is cocoa powder, dark fruits, complex alcohols, and a decided roast overtone that the rest melds together behind. A truly sublime and complex aroma. Taste is very roasty, some cocoa and coffee with a lot of yeast fruitiness. This tastes quite a bit like a foreign extra stout fermented on the hot side. Lots of interesting yeast phenols. Luckily, there was enough alcohol, malt, and other flavors to mask that somewhat, as it is a mild gag-inducer for me.

Some notes of earthy coffee and chocolate coruscate through to a dry, dark finish. Very thick, very viscous, very creamy, and very complex. A very balanced taste between bitter hops and dark characters delivers a spectacular brew with a phenomenal finish. Spectacular! Think Dark City epiphany and dénouement. If ""the limits of my language are the limits of my world"", this must be near the limits of my beer.","Oxford, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Shakesbeere"

1019,"2009-07-21",4.0,"Finally getting around to rating this. Wow, it took a long time. Sweet dark malt aroma, a little teriyaki sauce, chocolate, and roasted notes. Some earth is hiding in there as well. Pours jet black with a thin brown head. The flavor is initially sweet with bbq and teriyaki, some molasses rolls through and then a long roasted note dries out the palate. Some earthy notes make their presence felt as well as a rather noticeable hop bitterness . Full bodied viscous beer probably better suited for a winter evening then a muggy hot night during July.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

1019,"2009-07-18",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2012 Fantasticly sweet, roasted aroma! Looks so, so beautiful.  Silky, shimmeringly black. Flavor... So roasted and yummy it tastes like BEEF JERKY. Oh, my god... amazing!  What a recipe!  Nice body, not too thick.  Finish is phenomenal.   

Aged 3 years (2009 vintage) Ive been waiting for just the right time to drink this, and now is the time.  The anticipation I felt just in opening the bottle... I almost couldnt do it.  Because once I did, that was it!  Like jumping into a pool, once youre in, youre in.

Some carbonation died (or leaked out) over the years, but there was just enough left to form a dense, medium-brown colored head.  Slowly, though, and most of it formed after I finished pouring the beer.  Its continuous lacing shimmers like a tacky disco jacket.  Its color... black.  And its on a mission to make me happy.  

The aroma is even more divine than I remember a fresh glass of it to be.  The reason: its obvious.  The same rich, maple syrup-like chocolatey roasted malt and alcohol remains, but with such a slick smoothness to it that its multiple parts almost seem like they originated from a single substance.  

Its not as strongly-flavored on the palate, but a strong cocoa powder and smooth, yet acute, roasted malt insists in the finish.  Im not sure Ive ever had a beer as smooth as this beer is in the mouth, even aged.  Although its full-bodied, it sits in the mouth and goes down even more smoother than velvet, more like satin with a coat of fuzzy, roasted barley.  

The alcohol isnt very noticeable.  Id guess 9% or a little more just from the flavor, and it plays a humble role in the character of the beer.  But its still there and makes the experience even more enjoyable, if you know what I mean.

I really dont want to stop reviewing this, but theres not much else to say.  Its perfect.  Theres absolutely nothing wrong with this beer, and I cant imagine it tasting any better.  Three years seems perfectly aged.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Coats the glass like a sheet. Nose and taste are coffee, chocolate cake, and carbonation is great.

WOW. Pours jet black like old motor oil. Brutally viscous with an almost jelly-like milk chocolate-colored head with strength. Blown away - cant get better than this.

Dont know how they did this but it smells like BBQ in the smoker and cinnamon toast all at once. Sweet, roasted malt is still not unbalanced at all.

Deep, thick roasted, smoky, charred malt combines with sweet brown sugar to generate one of the best beer tastes Ive ever experienced. Still blown away - amazing.

So, so warm on the mouth - a tinge of carbonation keeps it from getting heavy.

1019,"2009-05-21",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2016 355ml bottle (Cracked Kettle, Amsterdam)
On opening a lovely plummy and cakey aroma. Pours jet black with a thick tight tan head. Lovely chocolatey aroma, with some fruity hoppiness. Very thick palate, lots of burnt and roasty retronasal aromas, but some fruity esters too. So thick its almost slimey. Taste is pretty typical hoppy imperial stout, the burntness dominates. Finish is incredibly burnt, alas a touch astringent, and with a hint of soap too. Pretty OK, but not wowing me. In some ways the sliminess is offensive. Much rather have a Nekron or a Sportteri.

Unlike other stouts that lack a good aroma or thick, almost syrupy body that these RIS were originally made like, the Expedition Stout masters these two areas. The taste is of chocholates and strokes of dark fruits, like taking a chocolate covered plum and throwing it ito some beer. Though at times the alocohol was present. One of, if not the most full bodied beer Ive had to date. Just an exquisite example of this style. Maybe a 4.4 isnt so radical afterall.","West Virginia, USA","WVHouseofBeer"
1019,"2009-05-09",4.4,"I find it ironic that as I sit here typing this review for my 2008 Bells Expedition Stout, I am also sitting her savoring a glass of 2008 Bells Expedition Stout. With each heavenly embrace and decadent quaff, I shall try not to lose myself while translating my tasting notes into this review.


An unfortunate stigma of the commercialized fresh beer hype is that the stalwart sturdy legacy of quality beer has been lost, nay, oppressed by certain brewing factions. Good craft beer, both American and Import is brewed with longevity and more often than not, cellaring in mind. Fresh is good, but older is better. Like a fine wine, fine beers only improve with a few months to a few years under their corks, or bottle caps. The end results are as much a joyful tribute to their deep, rich, and complex palate as it is to the excitement of cellaring beers and seeing how they change with time and proper care. What will my Expedition taste like 6 months from now? One year? Three years? 5 years, or more? It makes my heart tremble and my eyes twinkle.

Holding my bottle up to the light, through her dark brown glassy confines I admire the centimeter thick layer of luscious imperial stout dregs which have settled firmly onto the bottom. They may not know it yet, but they are in for a rude awakening when I swirl my bottle near the end to get as much of her thick, creamy, and maybe even chunky bounty. Now that, my friend, is a beautiful sight. As thick and black as an oceanic abyss, my Expedition crawls from her bottle into my glass most begrudgingly, pillowing into a huge, dark tan head resembling chocolate cream. Globules of her soft bounty which I coaxed from the bottle stare at me from the bottom of my glass, teasing me with her decadence. Ah fate, she can be a cruel brew. As her head recedes ever so slowly leaving a blanket of lace all along the sides of my glass and on top of my brew, velvety smooth milk chocolate, cream, vanilla, espresso crema, and wood woos my senses. Her sirens call is bewitching and I am as helpless as those poor sailors of yore who, though their submission was tragic, was also heavenly bliss. Full bodied, thick and mouth-coating like nobodys business. I could almost be drinking melted milk chocolate with just a smidgen of cream. Fresh espresso crema kisses in the background, hinting of caramel, vanilla, and coffee. Her body is deep and robust, cushioned by wood and light smoke. Visions of fresh cream, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, licorice, and espresso dance across my tastebuds and into my heart. Expedition does not dry like some stouts; instead she is sweet, creamy, mouth-coating goodness with only a whisper of dryness working her way into the finish about halfway through. If this is my Expedition with only a few months under her cap, I cant wait to see what my 3 bottles will be like with a few years under their caps. Way too quickly, our moment or nirvana is over, my body exuding her tender warmth.


When I wax prose or espouse about a beer, I never really know how much I have to say until I say it. Apparently, my 2008 Expedition Stout from Bells Brewing had quite a bit to say. I would like to think that I am not just speaking for myself when tasting and reviewing a beer, but I am also speaking for the beer itself. Giving her a voice beyond the liquid contents of her bottle. In my opinion, the Expedition Stout is not expensive or over-hyped. In fact, she doesnt receive nearly enough praise and attention as the divine sensory indulgence she is, proving once again that I would rather cellar a bottle of beer over a bottle of wine any day.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Thick, but still light.  Amazingly nice body.  Starts a tad sweet, but nothing cloying or syrupy.  Ample chocolate, roast, and a touch of bitter coffee.

1019,"2009-05-04",4.3,"Appearance - Black, very black. Pours pretty thick, but not too thick. Does coat the glass a little leaving a slight film. Half a finger of light mocha colored head forms from an aggressive pour.

Smell - Lots of prunes, some figs, dark malts, alcohol, very roasty.

Taste - Lots of the same in the smell; prunes, roasty dark malts, less of a sting from the alcohol in the taste as apposed to the smell. A littly nutty in the finish.

Mouthfeel - Coats the mouth quite well, very awesome. Nice and smooth from the damn near perfect amount of carbonation.

Drinkability - Strong flavor hurts the drinkability a little. The flavor just punches you in the face on most sips. A very well crafted beer and definitely going to be a staple in my cellar.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

A rich complex flavor of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla as the nose indicates, with roasted malts and a surprising amount of hops...more so than the other imperial stouts Ive had. Alcohol isnt present at all; just a smooth, rich, creamy mouth feel that begs to be rolled around for a good long time.

A nice aroma of wonderful oaky woodiness and vanilla, bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee, some salty liquorice and molasses. This certainly is no sweet Imperial Stout, and for a change, I like that. Slightly tangy on the palate. Hopped flavor is salty. It has coffee (pretty dark roast, almost espresso), dark chocolate, peppery spiciness and a hint of sweet caramel. What comes next, totally blows my mouth. A massive bitterness, like youd have a 100% cocoa chocolate and the darkest espresso in your mouth at the same time. Wonderfully, bitterly hopped taste lingers and lasts.

Pours black as night, almost no head. Lacing slight but clingy. Smells strong, malty, alcohol not the least bit concealed. Sharp yet smooth, rough and full of alcohol. I realize its 10.5% abv, but others Ive had in this abv range didnt have quite the pungency.  Complex taste, but that doesnt mean its a good one.  Not crazy about this beer.  Perhaps cellaring would improve this one; fresh its just not my cup of tea I guess.

Batch 8183 on 1/10/2011

Oh, how much difference some time can make. My palate has changed too, but the beer Im drinking right now doesnt really fit what comes to mind based off my old description.

The aroma is vastly improved. Theres no hint of alcohol, just a beautiful bouquet of dark chocolate, resiny hops, and rich dark fruit.  Its nice and sweet and first, balancing flavors of soy, molasses, and leather, but closes with a very bitter, peppery chocolate finish, which thankfully doesnt linger, perfectly balanced between the two.  Mouthfeel is creamy and thick.  Its a bit more bitter than I like, but thankfully not overwhelmingly so.

Its hard for me to differentiate between what I drank almost 2 years ago and now; I have a whole different appreciation for beer now.  Perhaps I wasnt ready for this one. New rating:

1019,"2009-03-29",4.2,"A: The perfect pouring stout. Nice large 3 finger espresso colored head that settles down nicely to a small pillow atop the brew. There is also very nice lacing down the glass. This one could make People Magazines 100 most beautiful list. 

S: Lacking. There is not much really coming from the glass. I like big bold smells when it comes to beer and this one just dont have it. There is some sweetness that I can detect along with some char of the malt. I wanted nice strong tones of coffee and chocolate, none were found here. 

T: The taste is good, but not great. The taste of charred malt is in there, which gives you a sense of coffee. The chocolate taste is of bitter chocolate. To be honest I expected more. 

M: This one is thick like a milkshake. The coating is wonderful on your mouth. Had the taste been great this would have helped to put the beer over the top.

It leaves thin tendrils of lace on the glass and is short-lived (though it takes awhile before it fades completely). The aroma is strong and inviting: espresso, dark chocolate, soft woody mustiness, and a lot of fruit - cherry, hints of wine. The flavor starts strongly fruity and chocolatey with notes of prune, currants, cherry, and sweetened espresso. So far: wow! The beer gets roasty at mid-palate with a strong fruity hop bitterness, dark malts, and strong coffee. The finish is really big with bitter chocolate melted into sweetened espresso. There are a lot of fruity esters, too, all leading to a long and somewhat dry finish. The aftertaste is roasty and very dry with subtle qualities of aromatic spices.

Beers ends in a very unique flavor in my mouth for some reason, a tuna fish sandwich flavor.  The beer feels very full and oily in your mouth with very fine carbonation, a dry finish and an alcohol presence to melt with the roasted notes that carry on after the drinking.

The flavor is the same rich dark chocolate with fruity, port-like complexity.   You can tell that there are plenty of hops to balance the malt, but they dont really protrude at all.   There is a light alcoholic bite in the finish that reminds you how strong this is and dries enough sugar off on your tongue to invite the next sip.   Thick, mouth-coating body.   Definitely the most balanced imperial stout that I have had to date.   Amazing beer actually.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

1019,"2009-02-08",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2009 First off I have been looking for this beer for quite some time. I went on vacation too Orlando and stopped at Redlight Redlight and they had it. 12 oz. bottle - Pours black with little to no head. 
Aroma - Coffee, chocolate and toffee. Just great chocolate doughnut scent that gets me excited about taking my first drink.
Flavor - buttery toffee, chocolate and coffee but more like a cappuccino taste. 
Palate - silky smooth on tongue with below average carbonation. Finish is soft and slightly dry.
Overall - Best Stout hands down. I have been searching and when I found I was not dissapointed. Alcohol is not detectable and this beer is so easy to drink its SCARY !! I would like a case
RERATE - 3/7/09 - This beer is sooo damn addictive. I bought 2 6pacs and tried to age a few bottles and was not succesfull. This beer is like heroin, you can drink it cold or room temp and it still is phenomenal.
rerate - 7/30/09 - I have a few of these beauties in the back of the fridge and cracked one open to see how some age changed the taste. WOW!!....this beer is better with age, the flavors blend so well its like eating a piece of rich fudge along with a shot of hops, some tobacco and oak flavor!!!","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","SHANER4"

Big, big flavor.  Starts out sweet and chocolatey with caramel, but that goes away fast when a boat load of coffee and alcohol hits the back of your tongue.  A surprisingly dry and bitter finish.

Smell is toasted malts and alcohol mostly, tones of bitter chocolate and coffee, some toffee and earthy green tones

Mouthfeel is medium-to-full bodied, creamy smooth texture borders on watery, low carbonation

Drinkability is poor, i have heard a lot of good things about this beer and would love to give it another shot, perhaps on draft, just in case this was a bad bottle. if this taste is indeed representative, there is just too much sourness and bitter burnt malts to warrant a return visit","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

1019,"2009-01-09",4.4,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass to drink.  A syrupy, black pour, with a thin, creamy, dark tan head developing over a dark black body; the head was small and short-lived with some cling on the edges, but managed to last throughout the beer.  A potent aroma with a good mixture of scents, the strongest being the coffee and chocolate malty scents.  There are some earthy and grainy hop notes in the background of the aroma too.  The taste is intensely bitter and strong, with the coffee and chocolate components present.  Mixed into the bitterness are some sweet malty tones and a bit of sourness.  The beer is still surprisingly wet and full in the mouth with a lot of lively fizz and a detectable alcoholic effect.  It has a coating and clingy effect in the mouth from even a small sip.  Overall it is perhaps the most intense stout I have ever head, but succeeds in pulling off this effect; it is definitely deserving of its status as a world-class beer.

Slightly off-balance, but I think it only amplifies the brew! A significant hop presence combines with the intense bitterness of the dark malt to create a truly fantastic stout experience.

Aromas pack a punch: chocolate and cocoa, roasted malt, and coffee dominate the nose. Initial taste mirros bitter coffee and semi sweet chocolate mixing well with the roasted malt base. Touches of dark and dried fruits, but not as prominent as say Surly Darkness. Thick bodied, but very palatable. Head that retains well and laces throughout. A palate sticker for sure, large ABV tag well hidden in this murky gem. Strikes a near perfect balance, in the realm of slightly burnt malt and the world that lives between coffee and chocolate, with a hint of creaminess to prevent too much bitterness. Very special beer.

Flavor climbed greatly from a 5 to an 8 with a perfect mellowing of smoke and alcohol into a wonderful blend.  Molasses and licorice climb out at the finish, adding complexity to this brew.

ORIGINAL:
Perhaps it is my limited expertise, but I really was unimpressed by this beer!  It has all of the expected characteristics, great thick black texture, strong aroma, and a nice punch.  Beyond that, the coffee and alcohol flavors overpowered all other aspects and led to a punch of aftertaste.

1019,"2008-12-06",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2014 355mL 2008 ed. Pours a motoroil pitch black with a small, dark brown head with great lace. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate malt, espresso, cocoa, and dark chocolate. Heavy body- very thick and syrupy with an onslaught of roasted malt and dark chocolate and vanilla extract. All the sweetness is balanced nicely by a plethora of hops. 10.5% abv is nicely hidden. This truly is an amazing beer and fantastic version of the Russian Imperial. 12/6/2008 8/5/8/5/16=4.2355mL batch 8728  2007. It is now clearly obvious that this beer REQUIRES 2-3 YEARS OF AGE ON IT MINIMUM! The vintage Expy that I cracked it just wicked. On the same level as Midnight Sun Sloth. The pour is a near jet black with a wicked, scary, Martian red head with thick retention and spotty lace. Blood ruby highlights in the glass. Aroma is outstanding: wicked complexity makes it hard to grasp all the umami/savory character but what stands out is fresh herbals, camphor, Chambourd, dark chocolate covered raspberries, cherry truffles, refined and musty alcohol. The taste is just the most palate abusing wallop of bakers chocolate. Massive dark chocolate bitterness abounds with red wine vinous character and tannic dryness. Bitterness is full and palate devastating. Its almost like a sadistic pleasure to indulge. Ill give it a 5 for palate for the exact opposite reasons I gave Goose Island Bourbon County Stout a 5 for palate. BCS is oily, rich, smooth, and buttery. Expy is dry, bitter, tannic, and vinous. 1/26/2011 8/4/8/5/16=4.1355mL 2002 ed no neck label old school design. The pour is muddy near ink black with no head. Aroma is lightly oxidized with mint but lots of butter, port, vinous qualities with oak and burnt currant and fatty richness. Cinnamon butter and ganache. Whoa. Taste is soft, iodine heavy, lots of umami and soy. Palate is lacking- dryer and cardboardy. 5/9/2011 8/3/8/3/16=3.8355mL batch 7817 from Feb 2007. My favorite vintage of Expy so far in my adventure through the complete vertical of this beer. Expected ink black pour with a delicate, deep Martian red head. Rings of burnt Martian crust red lace. Big umami nose with delicate vanilla and big chocolate fudge. Wow. Taste is very bitter, spicy, with fatty and savory meat. No green olive, and no chalk that makes Expedition sort of unpredictable and sometimes lackluster. This batch is void of these off flavors. So much bitter dark chocolate and what a mouthfeel. Ultra silk and oil. Absolutely delicious...stunning. Unfortunately, the batches are temperamental and must be aged. This one is being consumed almost four years after it was bottled and it tastes absolutely superb. 10/30/2011 8/4/9/5/17=4.3355mL 2011 ed consumed Nov 2013. Ink pour, opaque. Thick reddish foam. Great rocky retention and lacing. Nose is heavy black crayon, tar, waxy dark chocolate, mild black olive. Taste is fully melted fudge, vanilla, buttery brownie, salty, meaty olive. Palate is super rich and ultra creamy. One of the best if not the best Expy bottles Ive had after at least 50. Awesome. 11/21/2013 8/5/9/5/17=4.4[ 2006 b7740 Bottle ][ 12oz ][ northernbrews ][ Trade ][ Woodshop Snifter ][ 7.24.14 ]
>> Pours clear, deep sepia. Minimal latte foam. Nose is mild minty/oxidized, huge cocoa powder and ancho chili. Taste is perfect: powerful roast, black beldi oil cured moroccan olive, saltwater, melted waxy 80% cacao chocolate wedge. Bitterness is powerful, but firm, never harsh. Body is luscious, silky, never sticky or thin or ashy. This beer is about power. It is about dark chocolate incarnate. A god amongst imperial stouts. Just silly in comparison. Like bringing a mass effect reaper to a knife fight. 9/5/9/5/18=4.6","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1019,"2008-12-06",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2008 Bottle gifted from my brother. Pint glass, shared by my wife and I.  Pours an incredible, dark, coffee-molasses color with a field-khaki-drab head.  After the initial pour, the head regenerates as a constant 8th-inch pillow.
It smells like a semi-sweet chocolate-espresso malt with a touch of hops and soy sauce.  Tastes much the same, with the addition of raisins and the bite of pipe tobacco burning slightly hot.  Very intense flavor.

The coffee, chocolate, & smoke continue in the flavor in addition to roasted malt. Bitterness is heavy & almost a little biting.

The flavors were full of roasted malt, raisins, dark chocolate, and hints of vanilla and smoke.  The hops blended in nicely, as it stood up to the backbone of the malt.

Deep pitch black coloured body with a brownish tint to the side when tilted and no head at all - not perfect. Aroma of oak, vanilla, bourbon, pit fruits and the obvious quintessential coffee, roasted malt and licorice. Full-bodied; Strong roasty flavours with coffee and licorice very noticeable - the newer batch definitely shows a lot of alcohol, vanilla and potent roasted malt. Without a doubt, the flavours are much more subtle on the older batch - with a definite pleasing warmness from the old batch. Aftertaste is pleasant, albeit different. The new batch (young) shows a lot of licorice, oak and bourbon, while the old (aged) batch has a more nutty and refined finish. Overall, a nice beer - still not absolutely perfect, but showing good character new and old. Without a doubt, I definitely preferred the batch with 3+ years on it. The new batch was good, but showed perhaps a bit too much alcohol. Overall - really nice to sample this good beer in this style, I’ve been saving it for some time :-) I sampled these two twelve ounce bottles purchased from Merchant’s in Dearborn, Michigan on two separate occasions, drunk in partial celebration of the completion of my first marathon on 26-October-2008.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

Pour is darkest brown, completely opaque except at the very edge, with a finger of coffee-brown head even in a fairly broad snifter.  Intense roast malt flavor on the front, with all the dark fruit that implies, cherries, raisins, but also very bitter, unsweetened licorice, unripe melons.  Transition to the finish, the sweeter chocolate elements emerge, and in a brew this thick, the long finish is like drinking chocolate milk, even a bit buttery.  Its all full of flavor, but the combination of bitter and dairy elements disagreed with me.

Nose is heady and rich in port soaked figs, black strap molassas and enough alcohol and hop fruit to complete the perfume.  Almost overwhelming.   Entry is as expected, thick and internally coating.

1019,"2008-10-15",4.9,"In short: A tasty, complex and perfectly balanced Impy Stout.  Nothing groundbreaking here but this beer is brewed to perfection.  Best Imperial Stout, period.
How: Bottle 12oz.  Ive had this beer many times before (fresh and aged) and Im finally rating it.  This rating is for a 1 year bottle given to me by dmac, thanks a lot Dave
The look: Black body with a very large tan head with good retention
In long: Nose is hoppy and roasted.  Amazing taste.  Body is clearly a 5/5, full, round and chewy.  This is everything world-class Impy Stout should be, a ton of roasted malts, cacao, roasted coffee beans,  some molasses, light fruity notes, everything.   But what really makes this one stand out is the hopping.  That big motor-oil body of sweet highly roasted malts is superbly balanced by an equally enormous amount of green leafy hops.  This beer never falls into the extreme.  A complex and wonderfully well balanced beer which is something I cant say about most of the top rated ratebeer Impy Stout (mostly over-the-top monsters).  Tempted to give it a 5/5.0 but Im still hoping there is an even better Imperial Stout out there.  Unlikely.

The torturous part about this review is the initial taste of this beer is everything I love about stouts - chocolate richness, coffee and smoky flavors reside in the mouth feel for minutes.

The hop balancing in this is some of the best I’ve ever tasted.  Bells always does well with this.  Finish bitter and slightly warming.  You never notice the alcohol.  I heard a friend say this tastes like every typical imperial stout.  I believe he was wrong in that this has the best part of each typical imperial stout.

Incredible. Re-rate. Batch 8311, sampled at 5 years old. Pours near black with almost no head. Roasted malts, dark fruits, and coffee. A bit on the sweet side, with lighter hints of soy, dark chocolate, and anise. 5 years is probably a bit past its prime, but still good.  Re-Rate. Batch 7817 sampled 6 years after bottling. Strong roasted malts, dark fruits, molasses, and coffee. Super super rich, almost fudgey dark chocolate-like notes.

1019,"2008-08-04",3.9,"12 oz into sniffer.  Pours a great oily black with a perfect, huge dark brown head.  Tons of little carbonation bubbles were sticking to the side of the sniffer, making it look like a soda and not a beer  this quality almost brought the appearance from a 5 down to a 4, but a quick swirl got rid of them.  One should not be able to see carbonation in a beer this dark IMO. The aroma is very rich a creamy  chocolate, vanilla, oak, booze, tobacco, molasses, and leather.  The aroma had a hint of soy when I first sniffed it, which scared me a lot.  This beer is HUGE, there is a lot going on with the flavor  everything in the aroma and more; very roasty, bitter, and yet still creamy and smooth.  There was a hint of soy in the flavor, which really disappointed me.  Without the soy characteristics, this could be a really stunning brew.  Fortunately, there isnt enough soy to ruin the brew, or keep me from appreciating the delicious characters.  Perfect on the palate, thick and creamy  a full meal.

Dark brown black body with a medium-lasting foamy dark brown red head. Roasted dark malt flavour is borderline overly boozy, has a bit of burnt oak bark and a bitter aftertaste but is mostly sweet smoky burnt malt. Full body is rich and heavy. Lots of good roast, but this heavy beverage could be a little less sweet.

After comparing the two and double-fisting each, I came to the conclusion that Expedition is probably a better example of the style (Imperial Stout), but Dark Lord really should be in a category of its own!  Anyway, I digress.  This is batch 8145 which is probably 2007.  Pours a completely night black fluid with a small coffee colored head made up of tiny bubbles.  The oiliness of the beer allows it to stick to the glass.  The aroma is not so strong but has a burnt and roasty quality with some sweetness.  The flavor is bittersweet on the nose which gives way to a huge bitter, roasty flavor which reminds me of slightly burnt coffee grounds.  There are also notes of black licorice.

1019,"2008-07-12",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2008 Re-rate: On tap at the Flying Saucer in KC. Pours a Herseys syrup black body. Extremely dark and thick. Darkest damn head Ive ever seen. Its two finger-widths in thickness and literally looks like a layer of chocolate ice cream. Its that freakin dark and creamy. Exceptionally lacy on the glass and swirly on the surface. A flick of the wrist rouses the head again throughout the session. Honestly, its sexy and turning me on. Im more attracted to this beer than the waitress serving this to me and she has a big ass rack, a table-top ass, and long, dark legs. Yet I still think this beer is the sexiest object in the room. The aroma is heavily malted, roasted, chocolate, and coffee. Some very deep dark fruit, licorice, and wine characters too. Sweet, but very smoky. Phenomenal aroma. I can smell this from at least 3 feet away. The flavor hits the tongue and instantly explodes. My tongue crashes into a wall of roasted malts, bitter hops, and dark chocolate. Some licorice, coffee, and a slightly deep sour berry flavor. Lingering mocha and rich dark chocolate flavors beg me for another sip like a chain smoker craves another cigarette. Leaves just a slight boozy warmth. This is a very difficult beer to simply sip and enjoy. I want to attack it carnivorously. The palate is as thick as syrup and as slippery as black ice. A very medium sweetness and an overload of medium to intense roasts and bitter hops. Overall, this is like Nagasaki in a glass. Im in love again. I rated this as a 5 awhile back and figured my opinions might have changed, however, I see no reason as to why I should downgrade this ogre of a beer. I am still completely astounded as to how unmatched this beer is. Im in awe. This is hands down the best stout I have ever had. Better than FFF Dark Lord by a landslide. This is the perfect beer.

1019,"2008-07-10",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2009 Bottle. Pours pitch black with ruby tints around the rim.  Even with a vigorous pour, the head is fairly small and dissipates almost immediately leaving very little lacing.

The smell has a quick hint of dark chocolate and espresso up front before giving way to a massive roasted malt and molasses sweetness with a noticeable alcohol burn in the nostrils.  Hops are barely noticeable as far as I can tell.

There really is a lot going on with the taste.  The initial taste of chocolate and coffee gives way to the aforementioned sweet molasses malt flavor followed by dark fruits in the form of raisins and plums.  The finish has a slight hop bitterness and a definite alochol burn.

Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy with very little carbonation.  Very thick and decadent.

Drinkability is OK for the style though I couldnt see myself drinking more than one in a sitting.  This is a very good RIS but probably not in the top few I have tasted.

Alcohol can be tasted but the effects arent significant..  This is such a complex beer that it is difficult to describe.

Taste is coffee, very roasty, bit of cocoa, with a notable hop sourness emerging prior to the finish, as noted a few reviews down. Finishes with a dry, hoppy, roasty bitterness. Palate is thick and viscous, but with light, crisp carbonation. Bottle aged for about 3 months prior to drinking, but the hoppiness early on is still a bit much for me.

1019,"2008-06-11",4.1,"Pours like thick motor oil into a wine glass. Dark cocoa head slowly builds, but doesnt remain for long. Black as night. One of the darkest beers Ive ever seen. Winey legs slowly slide down the glass, with specks of foam dotting the outside of the glass. 

Not a real strong smelling RIS. Definite roasted malts, slightly sweet. Slightly musty. Maybe some chicory? 

Taste is strong on dark roasted coffee. Quite a bit of hop bitterness, and the alcohol is quite well hidden. Roasted malts prevail. 

Definite bitter aftertaste, which sticks around just long enough to make sure know youve had really big beer. Chewy mouthfeel, with a surprisingly clean finish. 

Overall, this is a really big, really solid RIS. It would be hard to drink more than one at a time, but IMO this rivals, if not surpasses, Stone RIS and the other big stouts for the top of the list.","Wake Forest, North Carolina, USA","doppelmeup"

Alcohol notes come through after letting it sit on your palate for a bit. Wow, this stuff is liquid manna. For such a big stout it goes down super easy.

As the drink warmed I picked up grapes, figs, earth, grass, caramel, and prunes. So thick, so sweet and chewy! My lips got so sticky when I drank this midnight oil that I thought I was weezing the juice straight from a spigot on a Michigan maple; all the while my tongue was covered in buttery goodness.

I suspect it will be much better in 6-8 months.","Carlsbad, California, USA","IPALover"
1019,"2008-05-12",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2009 Bottle. Gorgeous, perfect tight-bubbled head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate; rich roasted malt and its counterparts. A touch light for the flavor to come, but Im not going to complain it under a 9. Flavor has little bits of everything, in addition to the notes in the aroma (which become stronger in the mouth), plums, raisins, prunes (none too harsh or prevalent), bitter hops (also never override the sweet richness). Palate is on the sweet side, but for me the hops dried it out perfectly for an imperial stout, that is enough to keep it from syrupiness without the hops taking over the flavor profile and not even touching all that richness in the aroma. Absolutely awesome. 9-5-10-5-19/4.8Rerate 4/23/09 Bottle, Batch 4728. Aroma of coffee, lots of molasses, a bit of tobacco, vanilla, big roasted malt, sweet alcohol, chocolate ice cream, smoked wood, citrus...wow. Flavor again big on the roast and molasses along with a dried fruit character that I didnt find in the aroma. Increasing citrus hop notes toward the finish work really well with the chocolate and molasses notes. Everlasting roasted notes with a hint of coffee continue to linger on the tongue. Thick, viscous mouthfeel. Intense and lovely. I sat down to rerate this thinking I would score it lower if I put myself to the task, but no, I really do think its that good. 9-4-10-5-20/4.8","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

Flavor of similar chocolate, coffee, roast, light alcohol, sweet sweet malt with a bitter hops finish.  So rich, probably one of the richest beers Ive ever had.  The mouthfeel is just incredible.  Although it is rich, it is fairly smooth and easy to drink.  The best Imperial Stout that Ive had to date--just super awesome and Im so sad we dont get this in NY.

Rerate, batch 8728.  I think my tastebuds have evolved since my initial sampling of this beer.  Now I find it rather boozy with some burnt malt notes.  Plenty of other complexities: roasted malt, light bitter chocolate, dark fruits, prune, raisin.  My overall impression is that this is too boozy.  And its no longer one of my favorite impys.  So I changed the score.

1019,"2008-05-02",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2009 12oz bottle courtesy of Knightly Spirits. This is one Ive been really wanting to try and I thought I had missed the production for the year. Pours an awesome pitch black with a small milk chocolate head. Nose is incredible. One of the best smelling stouts. Full of chocolate cake, malt and a touch caramel and vanilla. This beer is like a giant coffee and chocolate bomb. Caramel and dark chocolate start things off with a dash of bitter coffee in the middle and the bourbon soaked chocolate cake rounds things off. Super thick and rich palate. Each sips reveals a new malt. Despite the high IBUs this is exceptionally smooth, the only drawback is the alcohol is maybe a bit to high as there is some burn. Its a sipping beer because this has a really full mouthfeel to it, but a good stout is always best savored anyways in my opinion. Truly an exceptional beer from a great American brewery.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"

Pouring the yeast in the glass makes no differnece in appearance.  The aroma is heavy on roasted malts and alcohol.  The flavor is intense!  This is a huge beer, maybe the most assertive Ive ever had.  Rich bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee and molasses repeatedly slap my palate around with every sip.  Carbonation is strong, and the alcohol is very evident.  It forces you to drink slow and take small sips.  Its rounded out with a good dose of hoppiness, but the malt complexity is the real showstopper.  Absolutely fantastic.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"

Sweet and spicy flavor that blends well with a chocolatey syrup flavor. A little swirl of the glass brings the head to life accentuating the spicy hops and creamy mouthfeel. Very oily and piney flavors begin to push the chocolate notes back. Alcohol aromas awaken as it warms, though it just adds another level of character to this drinkable beauty. I could use a bit more chocolate sweetness for balance, though it doesnt need it really.

Last beer of the night for me. 2002 vintage. Dark black pour with almost no head. Could have oxidized and flattened out a bit. Ive had new vintages of Expedition, but this one was different. There was a soy sauce/teriyaki thing going on, along with tons of chocolate, booze, coffee and dark fruits. Also get some nutty sweetness on the very back end of the aroma and into the flavor. Flavor is delicious, chocolate, coffee beans, soy, and dark roasted malts. Full bodied, low carbonation,, very substantial and filling. Super long finish, chocolate and coffee the stars. I dont know, if you would have told me before hand what this would taste and smell like, I probably would have been put off by it, but this is the best of the very few Expeditions I have had.

Personally I like my stouts to be a little smoother, that tough alcohol taste I usually find more complementing to the taste of ales.

Very strong aroma of chocolate liquer, roasted malt and to a lesser extent, coffee.  The flavor is more dominated by the roasted malt than the aroma, with lots of chocolate and again some light coffee.  Initially, there is also a strong tobacco flavor that emerges near the finish which I did not care for all that much.  As the beer warmed a bit and breathed, that aspect thankfully disappeared.

1019,"2008-02-22",4.8,"The first time I met this beer, I was utterly defeated. Now, I am the master. It goes into a tulip with an inch of coffee like foam. This quickly dissipates to a thin ring which stays around the edge of the beer. It appears to be black, but when held in the light at the proper angle, one can see that it is dark ruby in color. 

The nose is very complex. It is roasty and has a vinous quality. I detect just a slight licorice aroma. The nose is very well blended. The taste does not disappoint either. There is coffee, licorice, port wine, and others I am sure. Beneath all of this, I detect me some hops. There is absolutely no hint at the 11.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is great. It is thick and chewy, but is not syrupy. As I am writing this review, the quality of this beer is starting to sink in. The drinkability is high, especially with the way the alcohol is masked. I will consider myself lucky to have this beer available in IN.

However, on the second try, I was blown away. Nothing stands out because everything is balanced almost to perfection. 10.5%? Really? Wow, doesnt taste like it. Color is creamy and black. Taste is an explosion of malt, coffee, chocolate, and hops. Alcohol sneaks up on you, the way it should be. Beers warms as it goes down, but not in an overpowering way.  Beer is just thick and complex all the way through. Last time I worried about rating it too high, now Im worried that I didnt rate it high enough.  Delicious. I bought some for cellaring and cant wait to try it again next year.","Indiana, USA","StFun"

Aroma is a metaphorical punch to the face, in a metaphorical good way. Roasted coffee beans, coated with layers of soy sauce and sugar cane. Flavor is out-worldly. Dank, smoky tea rooms. Pretentious chocolate. Sweet floral hops. Nougat and caramel intertwined in a lovers embrace. Viscous, velvety, voluptuous.","Tampa, Florida, USA","gunhaver"

I would recommend it to any real beer drinker.","Winona, Minnesota, USA","amishcaravan"
1019,"2008-01-26",4.4,"Pours pitch black into my snifter. Big mocha head leaves some scattered lacing and reduces to a thin cap.

Aroma is very strong, with boozy sweet chocolate and a hint of caramel. A fleeting note of red fruit as well.

Taste reminds me of Bourbon County Stout. Ludicrously rich chocolatiness with a coffee bean bitterness in the finish. A hint of estery alcohol is also present, but its fruity enough so as to not be unpleasant.

Carbonation is modest, body is really really thick. Pretty damn smooth for a beer over 10%.

Drinkability is hampered by the syrupiness and hefty alcohol level but its just so damn smooth and tasty! Great beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
1019,"2008-01-26",4.5,"Beer poured really, really dark with smallish dark brown head and little lacing. The aroma on this was chocolate and molasses. This was probably the richest, sweetest beer Ive ever had. The flavor was really strong chocolate with alcohol sweetness and an infusion of coffee. A perfect amount of hop bitterness on the backend. Fantastic!  The beer is bordering on being just too sweet. If you let it warm too much, its is kinda too much.  This beer really is a standout.  One complaint...if a beer is going to be $15 for a 6-pack, have the decency to package it in 4-packs instead!","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"

The nose is surprisingly minimal...no alcohol, no burn, just a real thin layer of coffee and smoke. Delicious roasty flavor with some hints of coffee, brown sugar, almonds, and a nice warm finish. A little stickiness on the finish and the simple aroma are all that keep this from being the perfect beer. Still, its damn incredible.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","DukeBrewDevil"

Very well balanced with the hops just poking out at the end.  I look forward to trying this repeatedly as it ages.","Wheaton, Illinois, USA","SQNfan"

1019,"2008-01-20",4.4,"Definitely my go-to stout, but finally getting around to rating.  Rating is for a fresh bottle; Batch 8145.  Pours black...thin dark-tan head.  Aroma is roasted coffee, sweet malts, and some sweet chocolate.  Flavor is very nice, and has a mind of its own.  Theres the characteristic chocolate malts and roasted nuts/coffee, but theres also a smooth underlying alcohol...almost like a canadian whisky, that I cant help but notice.  Flavor evolves very nicely as it warms, and theres a strong bitterness long after the drink is over, but it is pleasant.  The balance between the sweetness and bitterness is what makes this a wonderful beer.  Palate is creamy, but not overly thick, with a nice level of carbonation.  Although the ABV isnt listed on the bottle, you know theres some alcohol content with a slight burn/warming after  swallowing.  Id be hard pressed to find a better beer for the price at about $2.50/bottle...this is a great drink!","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"

1019,"2008-01-19",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2008 Bottle. Pours black and thick with a very thin head. This beer is a shape-shifting monster, or at least one with multiple personalities.  Flavors and aftertaste seem to change with each mouthful. Hops go in and out of hiding while roasted coffee and chocolate battle for supremacy neither having the strength to stay in front of their fierce opponent for long. Even with all this going on, the beer is quite drinkable, and at its current price, you can afford to. Expedition stout is a great brewerys flagship beer and worthy of its current rank.","Orland Park, Illinois, USA","LeMunche"

1019,"2008-01-18",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2009 I dont even know where to begin with....this is one of the most complex beers I have had, also probably the best as well. The pour is very black...oily even, maybe like looking across the event horizon into a black hole. The only other beer that I have seen as thick is Founders KB. The nose is almost pure roasted malt...coffee and underlying tones of chocolate. A very subtle hint hops, although most of the hops are covered by the malt. The flavor is intense...undulating waves of roasted coffee and smooth, silky chocolate. A sweetness that is similar to dark sugar (Belgian maybe) or to dark fruits. The only bitterness might come at the end (I have found that sometimes its there, and other times its not..very mysterious). Overall this beer is amazing...so smooth and roasted....you sink into the intense maltiness with every sip of this masterpiece. RERATE: The wording stays the same, but the new rating is 5.0 to reflect the newest batch from Bells, which is quite possibly the best beer ever created. Simply put....the best beer I’ve ever had","Norman, Oklahoma, USA","milljam"

The aroma is malty with hints of alcohol , coffee and chocolate.  The flavor is of sweet chocolate and coffee with a bit bitterness.  The most noticeable aspect of drinking this beer is how creamy it is in the mouth.  This beer has a lot of flavor and is very heavy.  A good winter beer no doubt.","Bozeman, Montana, USA","natejgood"

Very well-balanced nose of sweet and bitter dark chocolate, coffee, dusty earthiness and faint earthy hops, roasted malt, etc.-- the list could go on and on. Flavor is again incredibly balanced, with notes of roasted malt and chocolate at the forefront. Bitter enough to counter the sweet flavors, full and very drawn-out mouthfeel, with a wonderful bitter chocolate aftertaste. Opens up beautifully as it warms, and the alcohol is completely masked.

1019,"2008-01-11",4.4,"I was lucky enough to have this on draft at Redlight Redlight. Huge thanks to Brent for putting this on tap. This poured a deep black color, almost opaque, with dark brown around the edges and a thin tan head. The aroma was very complex and very inviting, just outstanding. It smelled at first of dark chocolate and malts and a huge roasty smell with a touch of hops as well. As it warmed up I was able to get some vanilla, oak, and milk chocolate as well. It was to cold at first from the tap so the flavor was very roasty and bitter, but as it warmed up the true flavor came out. The chocolate came through first with a touch of coffee in there follwed by the vanilla and oak flavors that blended perfectly together. The hops and roasty tasty came through in the finish. This was definitely full bodied with a nice creamy mouthfeel. It is a big beer and one meant for sipping. It went down very smooth with the right amount of roastednes and bitterness in the background. Just a pleasure to have been able to try on tap.

Nice, low key label.  Had this at room temperature, and what a strong, rich stout it turned out to be.  The flavors play around in the mouth, sometimes one dominates, sometimes another.  There is coffee, alcohol, yeast, hops, honey, tobacco, cocoa, and roasted grains.  The finish is not bitter and the aftertaste is nice.  Amazing - this is the kind of beer that could make its way into my dreams.  Unfortunately, I did take it down a couple of notches in 2009.

Ive been looking forward to this beer for quite awhile, since they dont distribute in my home state of Georgia... but finally got my hands on some.... absolutely outstanding!

Strong aromas of roasted malts, coffee, fruits, licorice and  chocolate.  Thick full body which rolls right over the tongue while unleashing its multiple qualities previously described in its aroma.  If you can get this beer - buy it today.  If not, trade for it, call someone who can get it, do whatever is necessary to get some, b/c it does not disappoint one bit.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
1019,"2007-12-21",4.3,"At last we meet. My fears that you would be another imperial stout overly dominated by hops proved to be unfounded. Instead, you were a powerful and complex black brew with some real balance. Extreme, yes, but gorgeous and intelligent. Bottle pours thick and oily black, with an equally thick head thats nearly dark brown. Whoa. Aroma is roasty and bitter, with loads of espresso and dark chocolate. Flavor begins a touch sweet (like mocha) before folding into the bitterness. Its hoppy, but its malty enough that the espresso and dark chocolate supercede the old, dry greenery. I dont even know if that makes sense. I dont care. Thick, creamy and oily mouthfeel. Lightly sweet but mostly bitter, roasty finish and aftertaste. Challenging and delicious.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
1019,"2007-12-20",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2008 Bottle on 12/20/07 from Jan07. Appearance: Pretty damn black, dark brown head. Aroma: Licorice, dark fruits, faint pine hops, caramel & toffee mixed with a little bit of alcohol, sweet chocolate. Sweet milk chocolate comes out more as the beer approaches room temperature. Aroma: Taste:  Hits you right away with dark fruits & a little bit of alcohol. Then chocolate comes in, but soon relinquishes its spot back to the dark fruits & alcohol at the very beginning of the finish. But then it leaves an amazing chocolate/toffee/burnt malt taste on the front half of the tongue. Perfect smoothness, no stickiness. Yes, thick as motor oil. 9/5/9/4/17-4.4

The first sip is a little bit rough, but after that its smooth sailing. The taste of alcohol lingers, but it only compliments the thick, creamy, chocolate/toffee flavor of the beer. Fantastic brew.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","crowderm"

Perfect creaminess and ideal smooth mouthfeel.  Taste is perfection - sweet caramel undertones and chocolate aftertaste.  Feels like melted chocolate on the palate.  Just great!

This is a fresh bottle consumed on 11/23/07. Expedition Stout pours midnight black and actually swallows up the light present. A one finger faded brown head grew on the pour and fell rather quickly to a thin skim coat leaving somespotted lacing on its way down. An expected expierence with the high abv.

The aroma starts off with some deeply and freshly roasted barley. This roastiness is consistent throught the aroma and everything else is just a compliment. Deeply roasted coffee beans, a quick flash of dark fruit, quick lactic quality on the second half, and a flash of spicy alcohol and mild hops on the backend.

Flavor goes hand in hand with the aroma. Theres deep roasted qualities from both coffee and malts. Lactic, still green from the freshness, a touch of dak fruit, and a nice alcohol spiciness on the swallow. Its actually nice to get an alcohol kick from an RIS since most dont let the alcohol add the complexity needed.

Body is heavy but leaning more toward the medium side of the spectrum than the hugely creamy side. Alcohol fumes exhale through the nose. Spiciness warms my cheeks. Theres more of a hop presence than tasted or smelled and it leaves the tongue somewhat beat up.

This, especially in its raw young age, is a sipper without a doubt. I could easily drink a couple in a night but thats about all. 

Another great beer from Bells. Their stouts are above verage to outstanding. This is one that leans toward outstanding. I reviewed this one while it was very fresh. Up next will be an ged example and this beer ages with the best of them.

It was tough to finish. ll join the crowd and say that this is a great imperial stout, but not a beer that will join my list of favorites due to its viscosity.","USA","keithw"
1019,"2007-12-04",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2012 Bottle acquired via trade with Ty. I had this beer once before from Eric and I was unsure how to rate it. It is really a great beer.

The body is great: thick and rich, but also smooth. A great balance overall. Awesome. 
Re-rate: bottle thanks to John. Batch 8145, brewed in September 2007, drank August 2009. Pours that amazing picture of a dark crude oil color with a thick and mouthwatering brown head. I love this beer! A full flavor of so many dark fruits, lots of coffee hides in the background. Vanilla and ripe citrus hops come to the fore as well. Amazing. Especially considering that I can trade for this beer easily. Just as good as anything else. Smooth and creamy. Re-rate: another bottle thanks to John. Batch 7740 bottled December 19, 2006 drank October 2009. Its amazing how the aroma wafts out of the bottle, it hits me with an intensity; I know this beer, and I love it. Rich and fruity, not much of a hop presence. Perfect. A perfect mouthfeel and appearance. What can I say? Please Bells, never stop making this, and never change it. Batch 7817, packaged February 1st 2007, drank December 2009. Just lovely as always. Massive oil can like deep dark flavors. This aroma is ingrained into my memory, when I breath in the Expedition goodness I feel great. Amazing beer every time you try it.  Re-rate: batch 9459 bottled Nov 19, 2009- drank 1/31/10- so very fresh. Sweeter, hops are present for sure. Juicier and slightly hot. Different than the older vintages Ive had, very good.

on tap @ redlight, 12oz snifter. So, this was my first experience with this beer. It poured pitch black with a thick brown head. Could smelled the hops, chocolate, roasted malts. Taste was of chocolate, heavily hoppy but well balance with the roastyness and strong malts. Mouthfeel was amazing and though I could feel the warming effects of the alcohol, it wasnt apparent in the taste at all. Aftertaste was where the hops really stood out. Didnt quite realize the full effect of the hops until after the other flavors had faded and the hops were still there. Pretty great, looking forward to picking up some bottles and seeing how they taste after they have a little age on them.","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"

1019,"2007-11-21",4.8,"I loved this beer...  absolutely loved it.  I was sad when I finished it.  When I first read the description of what a stout tastes like, this is what I thought it would taste like.  This was the first beer that met that image that I had in my head.

My jaw dropped when I poured this one - black color with a very deep brown-colored foamy head.  Its gorgeous.  The aroma is the aroma that I always expected in a stout.  Malty aroma balanced out with coffee notes and subtle chocolate notes.  Wow.  Flavor is a wonderful blend of the malty sweetness and slight coffee-like bitterness that lingers on the palate for the perfect length of time.

This beer is gorgeous.  Thank you Bells and keep up the great brewing.","Lexington, Massachusetts, USA","mvcramer"

1019,"2007-11-17",4.4,"The aroma was roasty and fruity with strong presence of chocolate and sweet caramel. The aroma had an espresso acidity and dark fruits, raisins and prunes, coupled with a sweetness that was cakelike and bready. The chocolate was dark and luscious to the nose. The beer poured pitch black with a dark brown slow rising and falling head which laced the glass from top to bottom. The flavor was rich and luscious with malty chocolate and strong espresso roast. The flavor was smoky and deep with strong acidic bittering which kept the malt in check and eventually won the battle. Dark fruits of raisin and prune were present. The flavor also contained a nice grassy flavor and bittering. The finish was dry with lasting roast and hop bittering into the aftertaste. The body was full and viscous and the carbonation was low. The beer was nice and creamy on the palate. Alcohol warming was notable post consumption and was substantial.

Batch 7696, bottle thanks to drewbeerme.  Pours the same inky black color with a thin, deep tan head that diminishes.  Deep roasty aroma with chocolate, coffee, and a hint of alcohol peaking through.  Smooth caramel chocolate entry transitions into a strong roasty middle, with a nice coffee flavor on the finish.  Smooth and silky as ever.   Still could probably hold longer, thank goodness Drew sent me a couple more, thanks a ton Drew.

Aroma of rich dark roast malt, floral, sweet, spicy hops with some chocolate, coffee and a trace of alcohol.

Alcohol is noticeable, perhaps an aged bottle should be sampled. Some sweetness but not overdone. Plenty of complexity and flavor in this well balanced Impy stout. Excellent!

  Pours opaque midnight. No light can be seen through this gorgeous Impy! The aroma is rich and malty, with leather, bourbon (?), coffee and chocolate with a hint of alcohol. The head is full and lasting, foaming slowly down to nice lacing. The flavor is remarkable, with the aroma supported perfectly, but in addition there is an earthy character that compliments nicely. 
 RERATE- every time I have this beer it’s different. First time was awesome, every time since just good. Dropped .3 points for lack of consistency, and for shelling out for shipping and for trading to get a case that now is a very good beer, but not great like when I first had it.","SF Bay Area, California, USA","AgentSteve"

Very good balance of charred oak, thistle, bourbon, and cherry notes  Bitter ash and grapefruit peel finish. At first, I felt it came on too strong, but once I got over the shock I began to really enjoy it. Even so, it would be very hard to drink a lot of these in succession.

Some dark fruits & mollasses make their presence, but then they get a splash of bitter hops that overlay it. The dark chocolate comes in the third tier it is also very smooth and calm leading you into a roasted coffee. The bitter hops seem to remain in the background until the end of the finish.

The finish is extremely long, and new notes turn up all the time, they are among others chocolate, bitterness, licorice and again some berries.

1019,"2007-08-22",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 10, 2007 Bottle #7817.  Purchased at Discount Liquor, Milwaukee.  Ive had this many times, and it has been a favorite for a long time, but I have never rated it.  One of the best bottles Ive had was a 2003 that they found under the counter at Clark St. Ale House in Chicago a couple years ago; wish I would have rated that one.  Dark all the way through, from the inky black syrup pour to the dark tan foam of head (which is pretty small and fizzy, and dissipates quickly).  Pungent aroma full of aparent alcohol; smells like it was bourbon aged.  Leaves no lacing, but an oily layer of liquid clings to the side like Karo syrup; very viscous.  First impressions: Luxurious feel.  Finish is very hoppy, somewhat dry, but not that bitter (overwhelmed by the texture and the latent sugars).  Woosdy sweetness lingers on the top of the tongue as butterscotch starts on the sides, and gives way to alcohol burn only on the sides of the tongue.The hops in the finish are somewhat tangy, and the feel of the beer lingers forever.  Deeper:  Initially like melted dark chocolate.  The chocolate stays but is much less sweet in the finish, blending with the hops to add to the bitterness.  The head comes back in a thick layer of foam when twirled; it looks contiguous, with no bubbles comprising it.  I feel like I could light this on fire in the winter if I ran out of wood for the fireplace.  Maybe Ill try putting it in the car if gas gets too expensive.  Either way, its uncanily tasty for fuel.  Gets silkier when it ages, and I hope to save some of my bottles for later; maybe a little overrated for a young bottle, but at its best, its dope.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"
1019,"2007-08-17",4.6,"Multiple batches.  #7251bottled 25 Feb 2006.  Inky black pour.  Pitch in the glass.  Slight ring of ta head.  Sweet sugary plummy raisin aroma.  Cocoa toffee and spices.  Cookies.  Full bodied and big.  Wonderful play over the tongue.  Inital mild coffee flavor.  then the toffee sweetness.  Caraeml and raisins.  Then the citrus astringent alcohol ka-blam that sticks with you the rest of the swig.  Good but thick big burn!  Sticky sweet with bitter coffee acidity.  Evolving into the port/sherry vinuous notes.  Dreid dark fruits and woody smokey character.  Wow!  This is fantastic!  Rich creamy bitter stout.  Hop finish is mingled in with the coffee malts.  Tingling, whether from the alcohol or the hops.  Lingering piney resinous malt goo.  Stellar achievement!  Next up...Batch #7696 bottle 23 OCT 2006.  Same pitch hue.  Much more, Im talkin a fine layer here, tan head.  Larger bubbles.  Milder nose, more cocoa less fruit and burn.  Sugar cookie aromas.  Just as big and bad as the previous.  Softer somehow.  Smoother malts and less big bourbon burn.  More burnt toast and coffee notes.  Roughly 8 months fresher.  Makes a difference.  Malts are fresher yet still melded perfectly.  Stickier brew.  Coats the tongue.  Or it could just be an amalgamation of the nights libations.  Syrupy.  Burnt sugar and bitter coffee.  Still young as the noticeable residual sugars have not yet evolved into the apparent alcohol burn so prevalent in the previous.  Now, which do I prefer?  Itll take more than two batches to determine this!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"
1019,"2007-08-13",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2009 Batch #8245 (Dec. 2007).  Aged only 3 months, this is the freshest Expedition Ive had to date.  It seems that the malt components are even richer when yound, taking on a fudgy, deep chocolate, desert-like profile.  Anise and raisons also show pretty strong, with less vanilla and oak coming through.  It seems that theres a real trend developing here, with some of the chocolaty malts mellowing over time, givng way to smoothing, oaky vanilla.  This is fantastic when fresh, but I think Id give the slight nod to the 2006 vintage that Ive sampled.  Seems like 1.5 years is the perfect age for this, my favorite brew.Below examples are courtesy boboski.  Two vintages, both rated 8/11/07.2006 vintage.  What an absolutely fantastic beer!  Black body with dark mahogany edges when held to the light.  Beautiful, complex aroma of sweet chocolate roasted malts, anise, vanilla, oak, and raisons.  I could inhale this intoxicating smell all day long.  Layer after layer of decadent flavor fills the mouth with each and every sip.  Sweet, desert like chocolate maltiness is balanced well by just the right touch of hops and coffee bitterness.  Vanilla, oak, and anise provide perfect complementary flavors.  The palate is on the heavy side of medium bodied.  A bit syrupy, but not in a bad way.  Think Kalamazoo Stout to the Nth degree.  Thank goodness Bells is finally available in Florida.  Heaven in a bottle!2003 vintage. Very similar to the 2006, though it did show just a bit of oxidation.  Probably a year long in the tooth, but still fantastic.  I noticed a higher concentration of vanilla, and perhaps even a bit of hazelnut that I didnt pick up in the younger version.  Even at 4 years old, this beats 95% of the stouts I have tried.  Awesome!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Batch 7205 bottle at Chris_Os HogTownHarry minifest. Big thanks to Harry. Not sure what was wrong with the bottle I had at Chriss Shindig but the 3 times I have had this since have convinced me this needs a re-rate. Brown but almost black with a slight rim of tan.

Full nectar w/ full, creamy effers that expand on the palate. A fat marbled, malty backbone is quickly slapped down by an army of Robo Hops. As the fight for dominance ensues a few nuances are thrown in the mix. Flavors of  cakebread, roasted coffee bean, vanilla, coconut, and molases are thrown about like rag dolls as the mighty competitors call a truce. This war could go on forever.

Moderate pour in a snifter

Poured black with a medium mostly  lasting brown head with fair lacing.

Smelt of strong dark chocolate and mocha without even putting my nose up to it.  Upon closer inspection,strong dark chocolate, dried plums, mocha, burnt grain, sherry.

Taste was upfront rich sweet dark chocolate, strong bitter burnt grain, moderate sherry and vinous bitterness, moderate fruity esters, like dried plums or figs, followed by a harsh bitter burnt grain and yeast, and sherry with moderate chocolate sweetness on a long lingering bitter burnt finish.

Palate was full bodied, creamy, silky and viscous, softly but slightly stinging  carbonation, strongly astringent and moderately alcoholic.

1019,"2007-07-02",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2007 On tap at HDG. Part 2 of an indeterminite length ratings miniseries entitled ""Getting back beastiefan2ks buddyship.""  Oh baby...utter blackness with plenty of that tan head I enjoy so much.  Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, and piney hops.  Based on my previous experiences with hoppy stouts...well just the one, Im not sure if I enjoy them much.  Well, this makes it 1 for 2.  Totally decadent.  When it first hits your tongue, you can sense youre in for good ride.  Creamy chocolate and slight pine hops hit you first, along with the 2nd most luscious mouthfeel Ive ever experienced (1st is Raspberry Eisbock).  So beautifully thick, yet not to the point of sticky syrupiness.  After that first wave of great taste, comes the roasty portion of this huge beer.  It stays with me to the end, giving me a coffee aftertaste for quite some time.  What else can I say, this beer is truly awesome.  Glad Ive got a bottle of 7740 in the fridge.  I think Ill sit on it for a while.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
1019,"2007-07-02",4.4,"Draught at HDG.  Poured straight black with a rich brown creamy head leaving broad sheets of lacing.  Aroma of rich dark chocolate, dark coffee along with a vinous and/or Godiva liqueur note.  This one is truly exceptional.  Rich, dark, molten chocolate malts infused with underlying notes of ultra-dark roast espresso coffee.  Wonderful roasty bittersweet flavors of the malts complimented by a precise addtion of hops. Full velvety body thats in no way syrupy.  This one is clearly a top Impy.  I just wish it was cold and snowy out when I tried it--then it would have been an etheral experience.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"

Thick malts, chocolate, almost brownie-like, roasted barley, licorice and wood notes. Has an amazingly full body without being syrupy or cloying, just velvety and perfect. Thick dark chocolate flavors everywhere. Has some light licorice/anisette suggestions with a roasty espresso character, making it almost like an Irish coffee. Theres an extreme hop dryness to balance the ridiculous body. The finish is long, roasty, mocha-like/hoppy and dry.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Slightly oxidized aroma.  Thick malty syrupy taste.  Alcohol is present, but blends well with rich fig flavors.  Slight stinging bitterness on the edge of my tongue. I dont think its peaked yet.  It reminds me of an unrefined 7000.  9,4,7,4,17:4.0.

6/19/2007:  12 oz bottle tried in Japan with my wifes Japanese parents.  Lets start by saying they hated it.  They described it as a mixture of wine and beer and watered down.  A drain pour.  Hmmmm?
  Now for my review:  Direct pour into middle of glass, but still only small head, half way between creamy and not.  Still, I love this light carbonation level.  Dark rich syrupy color and thickness.  Slight roasted grain flavor, with hints of malt and coffee, lots of coffee.  Taste is thick, sweet, and a hint too much roasty flavor.  I think some aging will perfect the beer.

1019,"2007-06-17",3.9,"12 oz. bottle, batch #7696. Im drinking some of my best stuff in preparation for the RateBeer Summer Gathering, where I know that Im going to experience some intense tastes. Aroma of chocolate, raisins, coffee, the usual for the style. Also ginger, cinnamon, vanilla, and cookie scents. Very nice and complex aroma but not as strong as I expected. Improves upon multiple sniffs. Pours a very dark, nearly black, mahogony with a moderate amount of dark tan head. Produces a moderate amount of lacing. Pronounced sugar-sweet start balanced by a roasted coffee bitter finish and aftertaste. These tastes are overly extreme: Its too sugary and too coffeeish for my ideal. Alcohol evident. A touch of hops-derived pine taste is present. Complex flavors include vanilla, carmel, black cherry, peach, lemon, milk chocolate, and whipped cream. Sweetness and coffee flavors are not my favorite tastes in beer. If those two elements had been toned down, I could easily have given this a 9 instead of a 7 for flavor. The long, bitter aftertaste is as complex an aftertaste as I have ever experienced. Medium to full in body. Rich, smooth, oily, and somewhat lively in the palate. Not hard to drink, unlike many examples of the imperial stout style. Bells Expedition Stout is quite good, but I have to say that Im a bit disappointed, because it is not world-class good, as the ratings on this site would suggest. It is unmistakably a Bells product, and it certainly is reminiscent of the even better Bells Batch 7000 that I have tried previously. Note that I also was not a huge fan of Bells Kalamazoo Stout, which, like Expedition Stout, gets great reviews here.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
1019,"2007-06-14",4.9,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2007 12 oz bottle, batch #7817.  Ever since drinking FFFs Dark Lord, that has been a kind of benchmark for all the other imperial stouts... This one is just about there.  Pours black, thick brown head.  Smells chocolatey, roasty, malty, right amount of dark fruit sweetness.  Alcohol is hidden well, tastes smooth, slightly bitter finish.  Not as thick-bodied as the DL, but more drinkable.  Just about perfect IMHO.

1019,"2007-06-13",4.5,"I started drinking craft a few months ago and I figured Id try over 30 types of brews before reviewing.  Well here I am starting out with one of the best of all.  Bought a six pack on a trip to Wisconsin.  The presentation is terrific.  A thick brown head, sparkling lacing, and a jet black body that would erase the sun.  The big difference between this, and say a Storm King, is that it has a consistently rewarding taste.  I could detect caramel, chocolate, coffee through the entire glass.  This is right up there with the Great Yeti for me, although that one changed as I drank it.  I would recommend this with a grilled main course as it was chocolate overload with dessert.  Definitely one of the best overall.","Illinois, USA","eekonomist"

1019,"2007-06-11",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2007 Well...here we go.  I have waited for a while to pop the top on the mighty expedition.  Pours black with a medium brown head and perfect lacing.  The scent was very chocolately with some malty tones and a slight hop scent.  The taste is very warming with a ton of different flavors swarming around the palate.  The mouthfeel is sticky and warm, as the alcohol lets you know that it is there and at 10.5%...it is to be respected.  The malt flavor is apparent, as it the chocolate and coffee notes in the front.  I was very impressed with this beer...I am going to have to pick up a few more and store them in the basement for a few years.","New Jersey, USA","RiverHorse"

Black as black color with a surprisingly huge fluffy 2"" brown head that does finally settle to a 1/2"", great lacing for such a high gravity beer. Burnt roasted malt fills the air above the glass followed by overpowering aromas of dark molasses, bitter chocolates, and fresh coffee. Full bodied x 2 for the mouthfeel, you have to chew on this one while enjoying it. Velvety and rich, I can only imagine how smooth this would become over time. Strong alcohol is nicely masked by all of the surrounding powerful flavors. Bitter dark chocolate caresses the tastebuds with a blend of roasted malt, plums and raisins, nutty malt is there as well. Vanilla, bourbon, coffee and hop flavors give this dark beauty a rounded and complex flavor. Powerful and remarkable in all aspects.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
1019,"2007-06-07",4.9,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2007 Batch 7817.  Pours perhaps the darkest black I have ever seen with a dark brown, medium sized compact head. Foamy lace is left down the whole glass.  This is about as perfect as it gets for appearance in terms of a stout. Aroma is big time roasty, chocolatey goodness.  Some mild dark fruit aroma as well, especially at warmer temperatures.  The taste is incredibly rich, dark chocolate with a huge bitter kick.  The bitterness is quite extreme, bordering the line of too much but not exceeding it.  Very full bodied and creamy which I love.  Another amazing stout from Bells.  I still think Dark Lord is the best imperial stout but this is definitely number two and a head above the rest. 



Re-rate:  I recently found a 16 month old 6-pack on the shelve of a local gas station (batch 7251) and found the difference substantial enough to warrant another rating.  Pours the same.  Aroma is, simply put, the best smell Ive ever encountered in a beer.  MILK CHOCOLATE, so delicious, luscious, full bodied, milky, and smooth that it is orgasmic.  This smells more chocolately than pure chocolate.  Simply incredible.  Vinous and beautiful.  The taste is creamy, slightly bitter chocolate with a coffee aftertaste.  The palate is a little less full bodied than the more recent batch, unfortunately, because that was one of the strongest qualities of the beer.  Still this is undoubtedly a world class beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

I gotta be honest though, Expedition is fantastic.  Black as can be, the typical chocolate/coffee/licorice flavors but with a powerful yet smooth alcohol finish.

The aroma is a blast in all sorts of directions: dark chocolate, raisins, dark roasted malts...and a hint of alcohol.  The flavor is obviously insane...the palate gets hit with dark fruity and roasty malts, a ton of dark chocolate blended with coffee in the body, and a very complex hopped up licorice and grain note into the finish.  A tiny, tiny alcohol note is present in the end, but they just hint at it, in a very subtle way, just to let you know its there.  Deep, dark, complex, full bodied, full flavored, full strength.

One thing I hadnt noticed before was the pervasive bitterness in the lengthy finish.  This beer really has it all.

1019,"2007-03-30",4.0,"This thing was as thick as a milkshake and as dark as night.  Aroma has a strong smell of alcohol muddled with roast.  The taste was full-bodied and balanced.  However, there isnt a lot of flavor to the brew.  In fact, it seems like the beer is just trying to mask the heavy alcohol content, but it does a nice job and taste is initially smooth.  However, the masking causes this beer to loose any sweetness that might be apparent otherwise.  Finally, the aftertaste is a bit too dry and roasty.  Im glad I had this and its a decent brew, but its not a 100, & I think folks should be careful of rating beers high simply because they are imperial stouts or have high alcohol content.","West Chester, Ohio, USA","strangaj"

1019,"2007-03-28",4.0,"They nailed the ""darkest beer we make"" part, with a thick black body, like spent oil from my old Nissan Maxima after 200,000 miles. There is a bit of a very dark brown head, but after a minute there is just a small cluster of fish eye sized bubbles in the middle, and a crown around the edge. Move that crown and the lacing is extraordinary.  Aroma is very soft, of chocolate, alcohol and a woodsy pit fruit aroma reminiscent of a cream sherry. The smell is weak, and unlike any imperial stout Ive tried.  Beer is medium thick, yet creamy coating enough to cover the entire mouth. Strong flavor of espresso and dark chocolate. Very balanced and outstandingly powerful and deliberate during the intake and swirl. As soon as you swallow the beer, however, the flavor becomes sharp, burnt, bitter, like bad espresso (like the grounds were already spent), and tons of alcohol. I am a little split on my opinion of this great tasting, great looking beer. The mouth feel is the MOST GORGEOUS Ive ever experienced.  I dont know how they get those millions of pearl strands of bubbles to create the sensation of cream -- amazing.  But the weak aroma is unbelievable for a beer of this caliber, and its disappointing that it doesnt give the slightest clue to how amazing this beer is.  The aftertaste also is a little rough. An imperial stout is a joyous orgy of large, robust flavors brought together in harmony. This aftertaste is disharmonious and could benefit from some smoothing. I recommend this to all though, definitely should be on all serious beer drinkers resumes. Picked this 12 oz bottle up at Whole Foods in Falls Church, VA for $ 1.30.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"
1019,"2007-03-28",4.7,"My love affair with US Imperial Stouts has reached a climax with this outstanding beer. Pours a dark, dark brown with a muddy tan head that dissolves to leave a thin ring. Swirl the beer and you can see just how thick it is - it clings to the glass so convincingly you know youre never going to get it clean again.
And the aroma - without doubt the best nose on an Imperial Stout yet. Strong, bold malt, sweet treacle, alcohol and liquorice. Theres a bit of chocolate there too, as well as a handful of Morella cherries.
Sweet malt dominates the taste upfront, buttering the tongue with an incredibly thick, oily mouth feel.  Its followed by a dry nuttiness, just before the whip crack bitterness charges in and finishes you off. An amazingly complex beer - powerful yet graceful.","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"
1019,"2007-03-28",4.5,"Bottle Snifter, Very dark malty aroma, I swear coffee, and liquid smoke, maybe a touch of teriyaki sauce. Pours very dark and slow, similar to pitch, this is one dark and still brew. Menacing in its appearance. The taste is crazy huge, or as my new Hampshire friends would say wickt huge. I had to walk away from this brew, to damn complex to wrap my taste buds around, Imagine melting the darkest and purest chocolate you could find, and then blend it with rich, rich equatorial coffee, that has been highly roasted. Absoutly masssive malt flavors, and then there is the hops, which provides a great lasting and cutting finish to the sweetness. The hops play a perfect second to the malts, the hops and malts are not balance but the hop presence perfectly aids in the development of the huge a rich malts. Which  are in no way to sweet or cloying. I believe this bottle to be about 2 years old and I must say is fantastic. Light on the carbonation but very full on the palate. Truly a fantastic brew, one worthy of the ages and glad I made it my 300th!","oklahoma city, Oklahoma, USA","jetzler"

Appearance was pitch black with a small brown creamy head that fully diminished.  Initial flavor is moderately sweet and sour with light bitterness.  Finish was lightly sweet with moderate bitterness that had a long duration.  Palate is full body, oily texture, moderate alcohol and flat carbonation.
  Tastes of roasted coffee, chocolate, cigar smoke, with sweet port tones that turn bitter on finish.  Alcohol is acceptable but the sour notes detracted from the aroma and flavor (but some people love that).  Overall its in my  top 5 imperial Stouts.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"

Aroma is roasted malt, dark fruits, some alcohol.  Not as strong as I might have thought (I did just finish a Kentucky Breakfast stout).  Flavor is complex.  Roasted malts are ever present.  There is a sweetness associated with chocolate and molasses but it is also quite bitter.  There is also coffee and salt and some dark fruit.  I think this is another stout that gets better as it warms.  This is much better than my first tasting as I remember.  I cant wait to see how it ages.

1019,"2007-03-17",4.3,"Served in a snifter on St. Patricks Day, bottle code 7740.  An aggressive pour yields an inky black liquor with a two-finger, persistent dark brown head that clings to the side of the glass.  The aroma is crisp and refreshing, dominated by roasted malt & coffee notes, and complemented by hop and fruit notes in the background.  The mouth-feel is creamy and rich at first, a little oily later.  The flavor & texture profile evolves rapidly as I swirl it in my mouth: espresso, bitterness, roast malt, a tiny bit of astringency, slipperiness, a sharp bite, and a long dry, bitter finish.  Little lace is left on the glass.  A little alcohol vapor, not at all unpleasant, reveals itself as I inhale after each swallow.  Re-assessing the aroma after some meatloaf and cabbage, I can clearly detect a pleasant green apple fruit note.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Sombeast"

Not as robust-smelling as expected.  Opaque, pitch black body with a creamy, foamy dark brown head.  Velvety mf with loads and loads of roast and a lesser, somewhat raw gel of plums and raisins.  Touch of ash, but not as gritty or dark as in others (e.g., FBS).  Very strong but measured bitterness, not at all over-the-top.  Complementary strong saltiness is not as strong as, say, dubbel zoute drop, but certainly worthy of note.  Complex, obese malt profile attacks in waves.  Viscous, thick body is slowly and pleasantly warming, slightly syrupy.  Sticky lips.  Faint sweetness swims  behind all of the roast bitterness.  Subtle green earth with the coffee doesnt always work, but does here.  Roast and toast and chocolate fill the moderately hoppy, salty aftertaste.  Touch of alcohol comes through if drinking too quickly.  On the whole, aggressive and flavorful.  With a little mellowing and better integration of the alcohol, she could vie for a perfect score; will just have to see how time treats her.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

You could drink this stuff with a fork. Starts off fruity with dates and plums and also a bit of olive.

Many different notes in the flavor; molasses, various roated grain, coffee, anise, rasins and chocolate with some hoppy notes in the finish and a flavor that lingers on the palate.  Strong body and good mouthfeel that stands up with the many flavors.  Single bottle tasting.","DTown, Pennsylvania, USA","k4df4l"

Complex aroma of dark and milk chocolates, molasses, dark fruit, and coffee.  The sweetness in the aroma is just wonderful.  Flavors of Dark and sweet milk chocolates upfront, plums, raisons, and more coffee.  Finishes with a slight bitterness and some smokiness.  Very smooth and creamy on the palate yet somewhat thick.  This is a wonderful beer.","Santa Cruz, California, USA","tever"

1019,"2007-02-23",4.1,"Pours out like ten month old motor oil from my car. I had to run upstairs to get the knife and fork for this baby. Wow that is a thick stout. Hops are quite pronounced even though there is obviously an avalanche of malt here. Chocolate, plum, raisins, hops are main tastes. As thick as it is at the beginning, it actually finishes lightly and dry. carbonation is medium to low, but is at an appropriate level for this style.

A slow sipper for sure, but a perfect match for a soul sucking cold ass night. Im looking forward to aging a couple of these to see how it/if it mellows out.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","oakbluff"

Re-Rate:  06 bottle.  Oily black pour with approx. 1/4 inch tan, rocky head.  Minimal lacing.  Very rich dark chocolate aroma with some malt characteristics and undertones of anise, dark cherries, currants, hops and alcohol.  Thick as hell mouth feel with a slight, lingering tingle. Big chocolate taste along with dark roasted malt and coffee taste.  Hints of caramel/toffee that came out the longer it sat.  This is one of the prima-donnas of impy stouts Ive had.

1019,"2007-02-16",4.8,"This is by far the best stout Ive ever had.  At first you think its heavy because it looks thick on the pour.  However, it has a very easy going and smooth aroma.  No head on the pour.  The first taste was so easy going but very full bodied.  A perfect balance between alcohol and hop/malts.  The best part is no strong after taste, its got a dry finish too.

1019,"2007-02-16",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2007 Pitch black stout with minimal dark brown head that laces well. Aroma is very strong roasted malt, chocolate, dark berries, alcohol, and coffee perhaps. Very thick and creamy on the palate. Flavor initially isnt much different from the Kalamazoo stout, but after a second or so it really kicks in. Here you really taste the hops and alcohol. Chocolate, licorice, berries, and roasted malts are a bit overpowered by the hops and high abv towards the end, but still noticeable. I didnt like how this warmed, as the  alcohol began to really overpower everything else rather quickly.","Michigan, USA","lumberjack"

The taste is very sweet up front with prunes, coffee with cream, vanilla and alcohol. As it warms notes of cocoa come through. Despite the sweet start the finish is strongly bitter. Very complex.

Nose is at first very vinous, with cilia trembling power and ferocious roast. Aromas of copious, costly chocolate, unwieldy roasted malt, fresh crisp anise, lumbering smoke and soured coffee. Just stupefying. Flavor is just as remarkable, unleashing more smoke and roasted malt, tamed but abundant hops, more licorice and coffee, more everything. Smoldering black nectar rich with complexity. Palate is very thick and full, coating and luxurious. Finishes with notes of dried fruits like plums, raisins and a substantial hop bitterness that doesnt detract from any of the marvelous intricacies. What a masterpeice. It really is a daily challenge not to give in to the allure and crack open my remaining bottles. Near perfect, from my favorite style. And, wow, does this have style.

This created some interesting impressions. Notes indicate only components that stood out, not necessarily the entire impression, moreso just a comparison between batches. The original rating still stands and is still completely relevant:
Batch 6811, bottled 04-26-05
Thin head. Aroma: vinous, cream, touch of sherry(from very slight oxidation). Flavor: Slight oxidation(not bothersome), vinous notes, dark fruit, still moderately roasty. Creamy mouthfeel, very soft palate, low carbonation, drying roasty finish.
Batch 7205, bottled 01-12-06
Creamy head and body, touch thick er than 6811, still very thin head. Aroma: Chocolate, vanilla, raisin, prune, big alcohol notes. Flavor: very hot alcohol, roasted grain, bitter chocolate. Finishes sweet, then very dry, dusty and warming. Hot, biting mouthfeel.
Batch 7251, bottled 02-25-06
Same appearance as batch 6811. Aroma: chocolate chip, raisin, roast, toasty bread. Flavor: chocolate, red wine, roast. Off-dry finish, then very dry, very lengthy. Biting but creamy palate.
Batch 7740, bottled 12-19-06
Creamy, thick head, slow recession, sheet lacing. Aroma: roast, chocolate, alcohol. Flavor: roasted grain, bitter chocolate, toasty cereal grain. Finishes dry with chocolate, roast, coffee. Thick mouthfeel, medium carbonation.
Batch 7817, bottled 02-01-07Creamy, very thick head, quicker recession than 7740. Thick gobs atop sheet lacing. Aroma: big alcohol, vinous notes, bittersweet chocolate, anise. Flavor: anise, roast, coffee. Billowing with creamy carbonation. Excellent flavor and mouthfeel.
I was surprised that coffee and anise didnt make more of a lasting impression. The oldest and most recent batches were favorites.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
1019,"2007-01-19",4.5,"Bottle.  Smoky coffee, dark chocolate and hops aroma.  Dark black-brown color with small but extremely persistant tan head.   Flavor complex and comes in stages - initial flavor is of smooth cream followed by chocolate and coffee then a fairly strong astringent flavor and finishing with a brown sugar and nutty flavor.

1/01/2007:  I recently stumbled upon a few vintage bottles of this wonderful brew hidden on just about the bottom shelf at a little liquor store in NW Ohio.  Its been a long time since Ive partaken in a bottle of this beer, so this will more or less be a virgin experience...  
Bells Expedition Stout pours out in a silky cascade of near black liquid.  In the glass it is pretty much black as night and produces a thin brown crown just around the edges.  A rich, semi-sweet chocolate aroma bursts from the glass.  Deep inhalation also reveals caramel, sherry, and a hint of wonderful char.  The flavor is also very rich and packed full of semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and a light cream sherry fruitiness.  A enjoyable dry coffee bitterness comes out in the long, complex finish that also has a wonderful semi-sweet chocolate richness that lingers on the palate accented with the faintest hint of a delicate smoky char.  The alcohol is completely hidden.  The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and creamy (but much lighter and more viscous that AleSmith Speedway Stout!).  Overall this beer is amazingly well balanced between the semi-sweet chocolate and bitter coffee characteristics and has obviously aged very well!  About the only thing that I didnt care for (but did find interesting) was the funky gelatinous sludge at the bottom of the bottle!
Looks like I need to out and get some of the 2002 or older (theres no way to tell the vintage before 2003) Expedition Stout that I saw at another store to try...

2002 (or older) Vintage
10/01/2008:  Bells Expedition Stout has a near black like semi-sweet chocolate color with no head.  There is no carbonation left at this point.  It has a really interesting cola aroma and not much there anymore either.  Wow, this beer is getting sour, VERY roasty, burned?  Not so much so that it puts you off though.  There is also some black cherry-like in the flavor as well.  What the hell happened?!  Time has not been kind to this beer.  This is nothing like the 2003 bottle that I had previously rated!  This one has a medium-full body, no carbonation AT ALL, a bit chewy.  It is still pretty good overall, but is somewhat tough to get down.  Its definitely past its prime at this point...

2003 Vintage
10/01/2008:  This beer is obviously different than the 2002.  It has a near pitch black color and still has carbonation.  There is an average beige-colored head.  There still isnt much in the aroma beside some roast and chocolate, hint of cola.  Chocolate and coffee (toward the dry side), unknown fruits are present in the flavor.  This beer is well-balanced and very flavorable and complex.  It is still very good and hanging on.  However, it is probably be at its peak or on the downside now.  It has a medium-full to full body and is slightly sticky on the lips.
Its more rich than the previous bottle sampled and even stains the glass.

Batch 8145 - Bottled 2007
11/24/2010:  Bells Expedition Stout...  Aroma:  Smells amazing!  Its complex and difficult pinpoint all of the components:  dark and semi-sweet chocolate; muted licorice and charred wood; heavily caramelized malts; blackstrap molasses; vanilla; milky chocolate.  Appearance:  Pitch black and opaque; thin and frothy tan-colored crown.  Flavor:  Also quite good, but perhaps not quite as good as the aroma, but its also deep, complex, and difficult to describe...  I get sweet, heavily caramelized malt with hints of vanilla and chocolate followed by a lot of roasted malt and grain, chicory, and dark, bitter chocolate;  finish and aftertaste is like burnt wood (sounds worse that in really is) and a hefty dose of warming alcohol.  Palate:  Medium-full; thick and sticky; milky.  Overall:  Pretty good, but not stellar; I dont think that Expedition is as good as it once was and it definitely doesnt cellar that well either (1-2 years is probably best and then it drops off precipitously).

1019,"2007-01-01",4.0,"Batch 7740. Pours very black with a slow rising head that almost overflowed my glass. It ended up medium size, and after a long while left fair lacing. Aroma is roasted chocolate malt, hay and bitter, bitter hops. Extra full body.  Slightly oily texture.  Lightly sweet, heavily bitter. Also tasted a kind of harsh sourness - like guinness on acid.  Definitely a different kind of stout.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","MrBendo"

1019,"2006-12-29",4.4,"Pours like oil into the glass with a ruby edge and deep brown coloration.  Instead of a head, there is an oily sheen to the surface, a small island of foam, and a portion of the beer clings to the glass, not just lacing -- theres beer on the sides of the glass.  Aromas are blackstrap molasses, prune and dark fruit, and a spice background of clove and violets.  This beer hits the palate like a truck and takes a few sips to acclimate.  It coats the tongue (and the esophagus).  The initial bite of hops and alcohol is matched by a very sweet molasses and clover taste.  The long finish is molasses and chocolate, with a milky capuccino component.  Outstanding flavors, textures and length.  An aggressive, showy stout with a tremendous hop presence.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","jefcon"

Bitter chocolaty coffeelike duration with orange, lemony accents and carmelized sugar qualities that all sit on your tongue, mouth and lips. Very good lacing and almost foamy mouthfeel.

1019,"2006-12-25",4.5,"I have to say this is one of the best beers Ive ever tasted.  Thanks to Sprinkle at Crown Liqour.  Ive never seen a beer that pours as thick and black as this beer is.  I have had a couple of Impi stouts before, but never seemed to be as thick and inviting as this one.  The smell off chocolate coffee, and malt/caramel was intense.  The thickness of the beer was almost chewy.  This was a special treat on Christmas eve as I finished putting my kids toys together at 1 am this morning.  I wish I had more.","Hattiesburg, Mississippi, USA","garmonbozia"
1019,"2006-12-24",3.0,"As black as engine oil and nearly as thick.  The aroma assaults my nose, I dont know which I love more, the chocolate or the coffee wafting up to me.  The taste was super intense.  True, I poured it to cold but revisited it after a warm up  period.  Yeah, theres lots of all the usuals youd expect to find in an Impy and maybe even more.  The overloading of malts and hops are very evident.  Ive heard other beer drinkers refer to certain new beers that would benefit from some cellaring ""hot"" and I think that the taste of this fresh is hot.  Proportions seem out of whack at first glance with the hops being so in your face.  This coming from someone who could probably do without hops, especially in my stouts.  Anywhoo, its drinkable, once the shock of the initial assault on the tongue wears off.  I put a couple of bottles up and will revisit them in a year or 2.","Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania, USA","imzugzug"
1019,"2006-12-21",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2008 2 year old 12oz bottle, pours pitch black, thick, with small tan head around edges. aroma is amazing, loads of dark chocolate bursting out of the glass with espresso. aroma reminds me of 04 dark lord but not quite as chocolatey. flavor is just incredible and full of super dark semi-sweet chocolate, loads of espresso with a wonderfully rounded out roasted flavor. nothing burnt here. the chocolate coats my palate and stays for minutes.  the hop bitterness finally mellows after 2 years. 

2/24/07, another tasting from a 26month old bottle and this is amazing. additional worthy notes are theres subtle hints of smoke in the nose and flavor. the palate is perfect, thick but not chewy, full, long lasting, and no alcohol traces. flavor is lushish, dark chocolate and coffee in perfect unison.8/4/9/5/18=4.4. 


5/2/07, batch 7817, bottled 2/1/07. I dont recall expedition stout having a healthy amount of sludge in the bottle. nose has some unrefined bakers chocolate, lots of roast, rubbing alcohol, raisins, licorice, charred wood, piney and juicy hops. flavor is pretty rough around the edges, lots of bitter roast and piney hops, medium dark chocolate, slight smoke, raisins, and licorice. wow this is really raw, extremely bitter from unrefined roast and hops. alcohol is very well hidden. body is really thick. i like some impy stout really hopped up but this doesnt quite pull it off, and it leaves me thinking its sort of a mess. boy i really prefer at least 2 years age on this beer. scores from previous rating. 7/5/7/4/14=3.7.    

sample date 9/20/07, batch#7251 bottled February 25, 2006, cellar aged 19 months. nose is really toffee and roasted chocolate malts, sorta raw around the edges. very vinous nose. flavor has some soy notes to it, chocolate, lots of toffee, really rich and roasty with some meatiness too it. not as good as 2 year aged bottles but still better than it is fresh. 

12/17/07, batch 8183, a rather fresh bottle. pours pitch black with small tan head. the aroma is chalk full of roasted notes, some coffee, and a big hop presence, the nose is a little raw and unpolished but it does smell great. flavor is a tad green but not much, lots of vinous chocolate and espresso notes, very roasty, and lots of piney hop flavor in the background. the mouth feel is full and luscious while the alcohol isnt tasted. this is one intense stout. i didnt think i enjoyed this fresh this much. 8/5/8/5/17=4.3. 

1/8/08, batch 8183. man expedition stout is really like orval. every bottle is different. this bottle was far more ashy and dry then the same batch from my previous rating. still solid but this beer ranges from good to really freakin good. 3.9.

2/3/08, batch 6811, packaged on 4/18/05, so this is getting close to 3 years old. no sediment in the bottle. pours almost flat, pitch black and eventually small tan head forms and lasts along the rim. body looks slick and oily. nose is bursting with dark chocolate and roasty rich coffee notes. flavor has dark and hazelnut chocolate, caramelly, and roasty espresso finish. smooth as silk. low carbonation. hops just barely present but still adding bitterness and slight pine notes. awesome. 8/5/8/5/17=4.3.

3/20/08, unprinted batch number but I think its around 8185 or something. anyways, this batch is more roasty than usual exp. reminds me of Ten Fidy a lot. probably the best fresh expedition ive had. hoppy still but balanced by the big roast and its really drinkable fresh. a nice hoppy roasty licorice dark chooclate brew. again this is a beer that shows such inconsistencies within batches but if it ranges from great to amazing then thats inconsistency i love.4.2.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

1019,"2006-12-12",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2013 Year-old bottle, 2005 sampled Dec 2006. Pours an deep opaque black even highlighted against the brightest lights; coming from the bottle the pour seems more like india ink than beer. 

The aroma is richly roasty, powerful chocolate and coffee notes, overt but not unpleasant soysauce saltiness. The flavor is intense but not brash; rather, a full dark-chocolate intensity with whispers of vanilla and cherries, cappucino with a hint of wood. The hops finish clean and like bitter chocolate. The flavors have melded together beautiful, and the overall impression is of a superb bittersweet dessert. The mouthfeel is very thick, bordering on oily, and a bit warm from the alcohol, but luxurious nonetheless.

This is a fantastic beer, and it gives me yet another reason to mourn Bells absence from Washington state. The one thing that keeps it form scoring higher is that by the time Ive finished a bottle, I really have enough of the stuff for one night --- and I usually dont feel that way about Oaked Yeti or Old Rasputin. 9/5/9/4/16=4.3

Four year old bottle 2009 sampled Nov 2013. 
The expected dark pour, rather limited head. Aroma dominated by cocoa, hints of soy. Flavors of cappucino,dark choclate, the faintest hint of ash. Gentle smoke, roasty bitterness late. No lapse of body or flavor after four years, just excellent intergration. In 2006, little could compete. In 2013, a beer milieu where big flavorful imperial stouts line up by the dozens in my local supermarket, the original rating still stands.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

1019,"2006-12-08",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2007 Wow!  If you like stouts, you will love Bells Expedition Stout.  This is one of the best stouts I have ever had.  Pours black.  If not for the thick, carmely head, it could easily be mistaken for motor oil.  The aroma is somewhat lacking.  I would have liked a stronger, richer smell.  The taste and texture make up for this, however.  Rich, bittersweet chocolate, cherries, and malt.  In the mouth you find creamy roasted grains.  There is a mild alcohol and spice taste on the way down the hatch, which left me salivating like Pavlovs dog for the next sip.

12 oz bottle courtesy of brewjay. Batch 11503 bottled 10/22/12. The pour is a deep black hazed with a bit of brown and a one inch well formed khaki head.  The aroma is a nice roast, soft char along with a hint of soy. The taste is char roast right away, than a softness with soy, peat and a grassy dry finish. Nice integration of the soft flavors. The palate is heavy to medium bodied, somewhat mouth coating, then the alcohol is well integrated as it dries out the finish. Lovely as always. Lowered score says more about my feelings towards imperial stouts generally than this beer specifically.  Thanks for the bottle, Jay.  (8,5,8,4,16 - 4.1).

12 oz bottle courtesy of Indra. Batch 6672 from 2004 Vintage.  Pour is ink black with a thick, deep dark tan two inch head. Looks like the crema on an espresso.

Pours like tar.  spent motor oil is not even this dark.  no head.  probably should have had it aged.  but oh well, Im excited to try this.  Smells like a flat DietCoke.  Sweet and somehow unnaturally chemical.  Most of all it has the aroma of warmness.  Very sticky texture.  Mostly doughy.  It seems to be missing the  roasted malt flavors you would expect from a IS.  Full Palate...Very syrupy with dry finish and more than enough hops to balance all the sugars.  Just did not seem as amazing as the ratings have proved it to be for my tastes.  Sure plenty of quality ingredients, just maybe too many.","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"

1019,"2006-11-24",4.4,"Bottled.  Rating number 2500.  Many thanks to Kevin for sending over this gem.  A black thick looking beer with  a beautiful but short lived frothy coffee tan coloured head.  The aroma is wonderful and huge with big dark fruits (predominantly blackberries), licquorice, coal, malts, alcohol, cigars and black bread.  A real welcoming aroma.  The taste is very fruity and hoppy with massive bready malts also.  The finish goes on forever.  The taste is maybe a little extreme and lacks any roasted character that I would look for, but its a very well brewed tasty beer.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
1019,"2006-11-21",4.4,"In the bottle. Pours blacker than black.A slow cascade of brown bubbles in a dark brown head. Pours thick like syrup. Has a strong malty aroma of caramel and toffee. The palate is extremely thick. This is super-rich like a chocolate cheesecake. The roasted flavor somehow comes into balance with the sweetness and hops. Has some biscuit dough to the aroma as it warms. This is simply a big thick loaf of chocolate bread.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"
1019,"2006-11-18",3.7,"Bottled, Kookfest, September 2006. Big, black and brutish. Dark beige head. Oily consistency. Rich and full, with lots of coffee. Some sour fruit on the palate. But lots of hops that lend a citric snatch that I found a little incongruous. I have often appreciated some hop character to provide balance to a big stout but I thought the elements struggled a little to integrate entirely successfully. Not that this is a bad beer by any means. Its just that high expectations can tend to magnify any slight misgivings.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Blind tasting results, WTF was I thinking.  Not nearly as good as Dark Lord, but still amazing.

Post Blind Tasting
Aroma is sweet and soy.  Some molasses, chocolate, sweet.  
Damn, this is better than DL.  
Not nearly as viscous. More attenuated, subtle, well-crafted.  
Thick, creamy mouthfeel.  Slick, slightly bitter, no astringency, but some spiciness.  
Hops are still present after a year of bottling.
Fuck, this is pretty damn near perfect.
I can’t think of a better crafted imperial stout.  Taste-wise, there might be a few that are slightly better, but this beer is so consistently good that I have to give it a perfect score.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

The taste is what seals the deal on this one, a thick awesome nutty/roasted flavor with more coffee and chocolate and hops!

1019,"2006-11-02",2.9,"UPDATED: FEB 14, 2008 This is my first rating, so Im not great at describing the nuances of beer at this point.  Though this is a solid stout, it is woefully overrated.  The aroma is very nice, with vanilla and some bourbon.  The beer is jet black with a small, caramel head.  So far, so good!  Sadly, it goes downhill.  When it hits your tongue it kind of tastes like burnt coffee beans, in an unpleasant way.  Although I like the idea, it just does not taste very good.  This stout isnt even close to the Dogfish Head WWS, or even Avery Mephistophales.  Unfortunately, I bought a whole case of this, and have been giving it to friends pretty generously.  It personally leaves me feeling sick, sluggish and tired every time I drink it.  Horribly disappointing, basically like drinking a bottle of burnt molasses mixed with metallic coffee bean grounds.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
1019,"2006-11-01",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2007 Holy sweet merciful mother of all good things malty, hoppy, carbonated and strong!  This is one powerful brew.  Ive only been lucky enough to have two brews with the viscosity that this one has.  The other was some english russian imperial stout that was aged 10 years in a small bottle (cant remember the name)  Id love to try one like DarkLord.....probably will never be lucky enough to get it.  Anyway, when people refer to the body like that of ""motor oil"", this is exactly what theyre refering to.

Powerful aroma like a small fist jumping up out of my snifter and giving me a bloody nose.  A color so black that no light can hope to penetrate it.  Flavor that lingers on the tongue 15 minutes after you taste it (yes, I timed it).  A fuller body cannot be found with any other beer (maybe perhaps Darklord).    Ive heard that it reaches its true potential only after having aged it for a minimum of two years.  I have four lying down awaiting this precious period of time, but dont know how long I can be trusted to leave them be.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"
1019,"2006-11-01",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2007 Bottle. Ive had this enough times to really give this a proper rating. Ive been waiting awhile to try this at various times and feel this may be one beer that really has a perfect balance to it. The only reason why it doesnt get a perfect score is that it has very little head to it. Great aroma. Taste is a perfect balance of chocolate malt and hops. A beer that I always go back to. Cheers.

Batch #7740 - Great aroma and appearance. Tasting too green yet and not quite balanced and smooth. This one will need 6 months for it to show. The mouthfeel was great and I think this one may turn out to be a gem. 
Update: March 07  #7740- Tasted really well tonight. I dont know if this was a one time find for the batch or if I was just in the mood for this beer but the hops seemed no to be overpowering and mellowed out quite a bit. Such a sticky aftertaste. My God what a great beer!!!

Batch #7205 Thanks to TomDecapolis for the bottle. Very smooth and subtle. I picked up the aroma of vanilla. Big impact on chocolate here. Nice notes of smokiness here as well. Alcohol is undetected making this too easy to drink. Awesome.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","jason"

1019,"2006-10-29",4.5,"12 oz bottle.  Black as night with a thick dark brown head.  Very oily/thick pour.  Head slowly wells up giving a cascading effect throughout.  Massive strong dark chocolate, molasses, dried fruit and a heavy tarry roastiness.  Flavour matches the aroma with heavy oily roastiness, dark and milk chocolates and rich sweet plummy fruit.  Thick palate lets milk chocolate sweetness completely coat the mouth.  Finishes with loads of sweet plums and raisins and heavy roast helping dry things out a touch.  Really heavy, chewy, and rich, but displaying balance throughout as well.  Waves of complexity wash through the mouth with each sip.  A very stylish Imperial Stout.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1019,"2006-10-26",5.0,"You know, Ive been reading various reviews for this beer for a long time, and now I finally get to try it.  I honestly thought the comments about how dark it is were exaggerating, but man, they are so justified!  This beer is noticably darker than Great Divides Yeti, which seemed tough for me to imagine.  Its also thicker.  Anyway, the head on this was huge, but thats cause I poured way too fast.  The head forms very slow, so be carful.  Aroma is full-on cocoa, and brownie mix.  As time goes by, I notice some pungent herbal hop scent, caramel, something vaguely sour, or even cheesey, and then as the beer is room temperature, raisins and alcohol.  Great and strong aroma.  Taste follows a similar course, only even more powerful.  All kinds of dark chocolate flavors swirling around, and a definite brownie/cakemix taste too.  Excellent!  I was surprised how well the malt sweetness transitioned into the hop bitterness.  The flavors became roastier, the hops were woody bitter, and still herbal.  Finish lasted forever too.  Basically, there was no fault to this beer at all, I loved every aspect about it.  1 6-pack was all I was allowed to order at the time, but there will be more!

1019,"2006-10-24",4.5,"This stout came highly recommended to me. As of this writing its listed as the #9 beer on the Rate Beer Top 50.  This stout poured like motor oil with a burnt umber hue. The 2 finger brown foam head burst with heavy roast malt aroma and spices.  As the brew warmed to room temp within my mug, the aromas tantalized me to a point where I couldnt wait for my first sip. My oral cavity was greeted with silky smooth sweet blasts of coffee, malt and chocolate swirling in a pool of hoppy goodness.  With each sip I tasted more and more carmel and coffee.  A long lingering rich roast carmel aftertaste allowed plent of time to nurse this wonderful Imperial.  This is one of the best best beers that Ive drank to date.

Pours an extremely thick black body with a small thin brown head that quickly dissipated.  The aroma was intense and potent with notes of coffee and smoke.  The taste matched the aroma but was even more delicious with a very roasty coffee and caramel vibe.  The taste filled my mouth and a smoky roasty feeling stayed with me long after each sip.

The aroma was amazing and well balanced, sweet molasses, strong coffee and a vicious alcohol scent.

It balances roast and sweetness perfectly.  The flavor is massive roasted barley malt and PNW hops blended perfectly, with a few phenolic yeast artifacts (Islay single malts came to mind).   Bells manages to disguise the brute strength very well indeed.

1019,"2006-09-15",4.3,"This beer pours a mysterious midnight black that looks like a void in space itself. The head was a dark copper and tan that started quite small, but then fell to a thin ring, leaving no head what so ever. 

Smells of syrupy chocolate and an awesome, dare I say wholesome, roasted barley. There are also swirling bits of dark fruits and a subtle nip of fruity hops. This one just makes me feel good smelling it. Five stars! er, points. 

Tastes exceptionally sweet, but the sweetness is clearly natural and wholesome. This emanates from the smooth dry roasted barley that isnt too charred (espresso), nor underdone (barley wine), but just right. Bells hit that right on the nose. Theres also some port like qualities with some cherries and a definite brandy, presumably where the alcohol is hiding out of sight. 

The mouth feel is thick as hell and sticky with a light easy going carbonation that only adds to the over all thickness.

Maybe the hop over dominates the stout.  Good length, but is it complex?  Hop is a bit harsh.  Shame as I have been looking forward to trying this for ages and when I saw it in Chris_os fridge I could hardly contain my excitement, and then when Duff took it out....... but I was disappointed by the overly strong hop and wanted more complexity in mouth and on the finish","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

1019,"2006-09-11",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2009 My roommate once described this as the drink that Christ will serve as a coronation into the next life.  Pours like motor oil, in this instance ""black gold"" is more fitting, with a carefully tanned marshmallow head.  Aroma of Sumatran peaberry coffee, port, bonfire, and dark fruits/fruits thrown in the bonfire; the aroma is such an attack that flavor greets the tongue before the liquid does.  Flavor of more port, raisins, dark chocolate, coffee cake, bourbon, and maple.  Coats the mouth with thick, syrupy remnants of indescribably vast flavors and feelings, turning whatever it touches to gold.    Updated.  Aroma rich as ever.  A very young bottle exhibits a lot of char and tar taste, slightly acrid like the end of a poor cigar.  Somewhat minty.  Palate carries a bit of a bite.  Patience works wonders for this one.  Have fortititude!  and resist the calling for at least a year.  


Batch 7740, aged about one year.  Reserved and thick aroma of fig, passion fruit, molasses, bourbon and vegetal steam; roasty and full, with hints of toasted coconut and bourbon licks of eggnog and vanilla.  Bombastic flavor is slightly dry and ridden with plastic right away, but as the chewy elixir coats the mouth, the ashen buildup around the core easily melts away; tastes of deep roasted coffee and dark mexican chocolate, still retaining that savory meatiness of sumatran peaberry that it brings even when young.  Honey, maple, and bourbon in a lighthearted sweetness in the midpalate.  Full palate is softly carbonated; smooth and somehow sprightly.  Apple skin, pear, raisin, and molasses toward a very rich finish that pulses with charred molten chocolate cake.  Beautifully aged, having slidden into that perfect middle where it can command reflection or accompany it with equal ease.

1019,"2006-09-02",4.9,"Appearance: This beer pour absolute black! The head is moderate in size but rich in red brown color. A nice lacing is left as you swirl the beer, it simply looks exquisite.

Smell: Smelling this beer just absolutely teases the senses! A magnificent plethora of dark rum tobacco, leather, roasted malts, dark vinous grape aromas and more flood through the nose and straight to the brain sending me instantly into a state of awe! I guess you could simply say that it is a *very* enticing aroma! 

Taste: After all the anticipation from the aroma the beer does not disappoint as it enters the mouth. It is vinous and thick. It starts off very roasty and the alcohol and hop dance like pins and needles on your tongue then as your palate adjust you begin to taste the remarkable depth and complexity with deep red flavors of grape and cherries meeting tobacco rum charcoal bitter flavor and balancing brilliantly. There are also hints of sweet like a caramel and coco with vanilla in there too. The finish is very bitter, with a spicy alcohol burn like a great bourbon. The alcohol is not shy and I love that feature as a whiskey fan.

Mouthfeel: There is plenty of rough around the edges that keep you awake and appreciating each sip. It is not *harsh* but it is certainly not easy either. This is for a fan of RIS who likes liquor. The feel in the mouth is thick and smooth. It is so creamy I can hardly imagine any beer could be creamier. 

Drinkability: Simply put this beer is a perfect night cap! It is not a session beer (unless you want to hurt yourself). This beer is very big and not one I would call approachable. It is intimidating but for those who want a big ass Russian Imperial Stout stand back and get ready because here comes Bells Expedition Stout.

I still have thoughts of this beer running through my mind. Appearance is midnight black, sludge-like thickness with a completely coating mouthfeel that coats your glass and mouth with a wonderful tingly feeling. Flavors are perfect. It cant get any more plain than that. Coffee, rum, anise, vanilla, chocolate and hops/malt balance is just an awesome thing to behond.

The aroma reminds me of burning terribleness and it has probably permanately damaged my nostrils. The beer is entirely too thick as it coats your mouth in horrendous roasted malt flavors. To top it off, its got this extreme earthy bitterness to it that really ruins my day. Im sticking to fizzy yellow beer from now on.

I think it hides the alcohol quite well.  The body is thick and gigantic.  It has a syrupy feel as it glides through the mouth.  It displays hard core tastes of coffee and espresso with other earthy tones followed by a bitter aftertaste (not as sweet as some which I prefer).  This aftertaste is reminiscent of a Super 8 bedspread in a smoking room combined with a strong cup of coffee.

Nose is overwhelming: intense, roasted, with chocolate, liquorice, coffee, tar, hints of smoke, salt, hazel nuts. Im almost content just sitting and nosing this for about half an hour. Taste is roasted, full of liquorice, dark bitter chocolate, dried fruit, coffee, tar, syrup, with hints of juniper berries and dark cherries. A bit sweet, but just enough. There is an immense bitter hoppiness here as well, but since this is so comlex and wonderfully balanced it doesnt dominate as much as it would in most brews. Body is full (or rather immense), might order a spoon to eat it with. The fantastic taste and full body even mask the alcohol level. This is an absolute beauty and a true masterpiece, this is getting very close to perfection in my taste.

I pop open the bottle, and the cap stikes the counder with a wonderful ting.  Thick, way past 3,000 miles, motor oil black pour with a small brown head that diapates quickly.  I can smell the thick malt aroma from across the room.  Molassas, a floral hop texture, and a rich chocolate scent rounds out the aroma.  The taste warms through and through with a thick malt note, big in your face hops,  fresh Columbian coffee undertones, molassas, and slightly tasting of caramel.   Palate is bitter and stinging from the big alcohol content.  Only problem with this on is the overdone alcohol burn at the end.  Excellent Imperieal Stout.

1019,"2006-06-05",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2007 Poured a dark black color with a small reddish brown head that didnt lace worth a lick (high ABV?). The aroma was of roasted coffee, light chocolate, and hops. The flavor was much of the same with some dark fruits mixed lightly underneath. However, the hop finish (pine, especially) didnt do it for me. Resinous aftertaste and very detectable ABV. Mouthfeel was heavy and thick. Re-rate, May 06: Much better impression, the hops werent nearly as overwhelming in this bottle, the mouthfeel nice and creamy. Very well-balanced with the light pine hops, expresso, milky, vanilla, smooth chocolate, and dark fruits under it all. Alcohol sits nicely in the background for this high of an ABV. A darned nice beer. Re-rate, Sept 07: Wow, right behind AS Speedway this time in a horizontal against Speedway, DL07, DFHWWS06, and HF BORIS. Relative to AS, less coffee, more chocolate, less hops, slightly more sticky than Speedway, but otherwise very nice. Better than the others in the horizontal.","","User37895"
1019,"2006-06-04",2.7,"Good look. Completely pitch black with thin dark tan head. Slight retention with some thin lacing down the glass.

Sweet malt tries to squeeze through the alcohol but is unsuccessful. When I noticed this beer was 11.5, I was taken back but it really ruins the nose of this beer.

The taste is a tad bit maltier but once again completely spoiled by the alcohol. There are some dark fruits (raisins, plums) trying to poke through following and it finishes with a black coffee taste which is very dry after swallowing .

This brew is very thick. Bulky chewy feel.

1019,"2006-05-22",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2016 Bottle thanks to OhioDad. This is as black as it gets.  Pours with no head just a bit of brown lacing.  The smell is very hoppy, some roastiness in the background.  Overall the hops over shadow the rest of the smell.  The taste is extremely sweet, again hoppy.  Very light body for such a beer.  Extremely sweet, the sweet RIS I have ever tried.  good bitterness at the end.  Alcohol burn felt in throat as well.8/4/9/3/168, 6, 9 re-rate time, get low, get low ྫ/30/07). I always thought I overdid it on my first rating and I always remembered it as a bit too think hoppy stout and I always wanted to revisits.  Which I did in a blind tasting recently, and if I remember correctly it did not score well (but really none of them did).  This is batch 7740, which seems to be about a year old right now. It pours black hole black with a small brown head, so far just like it was originally.  Aroma is super strong, it is very strong on grassy, piney, green leaf hops which are nose itching.  Beneath that is  pretty strong molasses and oily sticky syrup.  Just from the aroma I can see why this is so highly rates, it is so not subtle.  For me the taste is just super dominated by hops, which is cool but just not my bag of tricks.  The really cool thing about this beer is the mouthfeel, definitely not like the previous time I had this.  Its super viscous and thick, feels like my mouth is covered with film. Long bitter aftertaste.8/4/7/5/16.Lets try it again.  Batch, 8728 bottled on September 16, 2008, so its about 6 months old. Pretty similar except the hops are a lot more West Coast aggressive with citrus, grapefruit, and tropical fruits. Very bitter on the nose.  Otherwise its pretty similar to my previous rating.  Rating stays the same. Bottle gifted from Indra, thanks Eric.  Batch 6672, so almost 5 years old.  It is headless at this point.  The hops have died down.  Basically, a chocolate watery drink.  Alcohol is still present throughout.  Would not give this 5 years at all without knowing what it is fresh.  The age, alcohol, and light roast make it come off as light licorice and anise. 
Beer #6 of 13 in blind tasting.  1.5 year old bottle. Thick pour with a head (heads were not common in the tasting). Head quickly fades. Came off as industrial, astringently bitter, acrid black malt-centric.  Just astringent and strong. In hindsight, despite my relatively high ratings, I never really enjoyed this beer.  I am happy to be more secure in rating it lower. 6/3/6/3/12.
In the aggregate, it fell slightly below average.  
Thick and smooth mouthfeel. Thick, fumy, cocoa, light roast aroma that almost feels like a barrier hovering over the beer. A little alcohol essence. Flavor has a bit more mineral and malt bitterness. But still a straightforward, not sugary but sweet and thick impy stout. Could use less bitterness. Returning AFTER FULL LINEUP: definitely the most alcoholic but not very strong on that. Seems less thick and a much more bitter finish. 8/4/8/4/16

1019,"2006-05-21",2.8,"I had tried Bells Expedition Stout once before, but had only remembered that it was thicker than most stouts I have had. I bought another 12 oz bottle a week ago with the sole intent to sample it again and review it on ratebeer.com. The pour was akin to a bottle of Hersheys chocolate syrup or perhaps motor oil sludging its way downwards into the waiting pint glass. Once the pour was complete, the glass looked like a pint of expresso, medium brown foam attached. The beer itself smells like the playground bully at Stout School: deep roasted malts, hops, chocolate, raisins, and probably 20 other foods that I cannot even identify. The first sip was jarring to all 5 of my senses plus 3 or 4 that I didnt even know I had. Explosions of bitterness, chocolate, smoky flavors! There is no arguing that this beers taste is complex. In my humble opinion, the flavor is just too abrasive for my liking. I certainly respect and appreciate what the brewers at Bells have accomplished with their Expedition Stout, but the truth is is that I enjoy easier- drinking stouts. I had to rate the overall score according to my own enjoyment while drinking it, and I just didnt feel that it was pleasantly drinkable.","West Bend, Wisconsin, USA","keoki182"

The nose is aggressive of espresso, bark, earth, and strong alcohol. Thick, dry palate of espresso, chocolate, and not-so-sublte earthy undertones.

[Feb 17, 2008]

How is this beer so black? It strongly resembles motor oil as it glugs out into the snifter. Superb head retention on this one. The head is the same color as the body of some other stouts. The aroma is thick and complex with raisins, chocolate, espresso, overall very roasty and sharp with commendable balance. The mouthfeel is heavy, to no surprise of mine. Flavor is damned roasted with a wash of espresso in a bittersweet smoky/caramel delivery. Nips of hickory and dark chocolate show up. This is very, very full, savory, and gracefully bitter. Thank you, Bells. I will be buying this every year if I can. $15.00 a sixer is well worth the quality of this product. Actually. . . thats cheaper than many imperial stouts that are available in bombers, come to think of it.

[February 27, 2008]

Bottle in a blind tasting.  Good old Expedition held up pretty well against some other impies. Had the most full, rounded coffee presence with excellent sharp roastiness, mild earthy tones, great espresso impression on this one. The mouthfeel was certainly the heaviest. As excellent as this was, I had to take away a point because it wasnt the clear, decisive winner of the tasting. It just eked by against some pretty tough competition.

[April 23, 2008]

Bottle. Pours black. I mean, this stuff is midnight black with an everlasting head. Lacing is dark, clingy, and dense on the snifter. Tons of heavily roasted, smoky espresso notes make up the nose. An acknowledgeable level of sharp hops 

[March 6, 2010]

Bottle. This is a seriously dark beer, rivaling Ten Fidy in opacity. The nose is much like the latter with huge roastiness, ample hops, and a dry chocolate character. The flavor is spectacular with deep chocolate, vanilla wafers, earth, hickory, sharp hops, and pure espresso. Expedition is thick and coating in the palate and a superb go-to big beer to warm my bones in the winter.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1019,"2006-04-28",4.7,"I bought this as a six pack; took me 5 of them before I felt comfortable enough to rate it. Everything about this beer is huge, and it took several bottles over several days to get the real character out of it. I drank it out of a sifter, small portions of the bottle at a time. Tastes best unaerated. Intense coffee, expresso, and bitter, bitter hops in the nose; along with subtle hints of dark chocolate, tobacco, and brown sugar. The palate is very heavy and the prime culprit for requiring such an extensive tasting. Alcohol is definitely noticable, and it drinks more like a port than a stout. Alcohol tastes stronger than the 11.5% would suggest. Rolls along the tongue with a viscous, smooth mouthfeel. Another great stout from Bells- which is rapidly becoming the best brewery anywhere.","USA","rdawson321"
1019,"2006-04-20",4.3,"Bottle. Pours black as night with a thin, reddish brown head. It didnt make a sound as I poured it, like pouring syrup. The aroma is quite roasty, with some dark chocolate, espresso, alcohol, tons of earth, and even a wisp of hops. Wow, upon sipping I first notice a huge quantity of earthy hops. Then comes the espresso flavor, and a lot of it. Good thing I like espresso. Theres also a touch of chocolate in there, and maybe some maple. There is a tiny bit of noticeable alcohol, but it is mostly masked by the intensity of the other flavors. The finish is slightly bitter with a note of smoked meat. The aftertaste is, again, almost identical to espresso. The palate is, as one might expect, thick and very robust. I can take a sip of a teaspoon or so and it feels like it fills my mouth.

Hops are present, but theres no ignoring the smokey goodness.  Vegetarians may be tempted to have some bacon after a whiff of this beer.  Extremely full body, light carbonation, med-long finish.  Flavor has some of the roasted malts from the nose, but they dont overpower.  Great coffee, dark chocolate, etc... Everything an imperial stout should be, but this has it in spades, and all right up front too.  On that point: this doesnt finish as long as other imperials ive had (try Siberian Night) but its no slouch.

1019,"2006-04-18",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2008 From Bottle, 2003 Vintage.  Dark black motor oil pour with a deep brown head of chocolatey char that quickly diminishes to a cedar bark ring around my snifter.  As I pour into my glass, my nose is greeted by a surprising whiff of red grapefruit.  Beautiful ebony color with only a faint suggestion of ruby read tones.  As I plunge my nose into the glass, Im greeted by a heavenly aroma parade.  Rich, succulent prunes dipped in fine Belgian chocolate and neatly garnished with a fleck of roasted Partagas whole leaf cigar wrapper.  Greasy, oily dimension that reminds me of hickory smoked venison tenderloin rubbed generously with a soy sauce marinade.  Finally, some other lighter, fruitier qualities timidly expose themselves.  Over-ripe thimbleberries, a touch of vanilla bean, and a bedtime glass of past times chocolate milk...  And now Im ready to take my first sip.  Wonderful, silky smooth mouthfeel is heavily laden with chocolate truffles stuffed with dark chocolate syrup, sticky english toffee, and oily french roasted whole bean coffee.  The flavors cling to every square inch of my tongue, forcing me to appreciate the way this brew marvelously bridges the gap between the sticky sweet candied fruit at the beginning to the dry dark chocolatey malts Im experiencing now.  Finally, a pleasant ruby red grapefruit hoppy finish, the conclusion and verification of my olfactory reaction upon initially opening the bottle, is realized.  This is one amazing beer.

Second tasting.  Poured from a foot above glass. I made a mess.  The beer rose and exploded, which was good.  Wanted to make sure this wasnt motor oil.

Vigorous pour into a tulip glass produces a black opaque body under a decent light brown reverse-cascading head.

1019,"2006-04-01",4.4,"Medium, black motor-oil consistency.  Poured into a tulip.  Nice, creamy brown lacing.  No significant head.  Graham cracker aroma with cinammon sugar notes.  Grape and date notes come out with some swirling.  As for the flavor: Wow!  With at least two or three flavor changes throughout the body, this brew really earns its marks.  It begins with a slight chocolate, molasses and intensifies with each sip until reaching a zenith of coffee decadence.  Im not even a fan of coffee, but this was amazing.  That held for a few minutes until the back-end dropped into a bitter dry-oak wood finish.  Cant wait to open the one in my basement in a few years.","Seattle, Washington, USA","malachi"

This intense mily goodness is followed by, and complimented with mildly roasted coffee beans, rum, some leather, and a touch of hops. FLavours are hopped up coffee, with lots of bitterness both from hops and coffee beans. Dark chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips.

The beer is very dense in nature. In my opinion, the biggest fault of the beer is the excessively high alcohol content. The beer tastes way too alcoholic to be enjoyed with any other beers or food. Additionally, the alcohol taste cloaks some of the other potential flavors of the beer. I much moreso prefer Victory Stormking or Troegs Oatmeal Stout.","Fleetwood, Pennsylvania, USA","mhoster56"

The mouthfeel is smooooth with a faint fizzy dancing on the tongue.  The taste is choco-dark coffee-licorice with an alchohol edge to it.  There is a lingering bitterness that hangs around for a while.  Again, nicely smooth and its nice to have a stout thats not wack-you-in-the-face COFFEE flavor.

1019,"2006-03-09",4.1,"When I first poured this beer, I could not believe it. Being a bit of a virgin to Imperial Stouts, I was caught off-guard by how black and thick this beer was. I could have sworn there was an actual delay from when I tilted the bottle until it oozed out into the glass. While I maintain the motto I fear no beer, I have to admit to some apprehension as I peered down into the black gooey concoction that was Bell Expedition. The first sip, as I expected, was very strong and a little on the bitter side. The second sip however was delicious. I am supposing that the beer clung to the inside of my mouth like it clung to the side of the glass and somehow supplanted my taste-buds better judgment. The flavors were a mix of raison, cocoa and malt. The flavors were balanced and worked well with the heavy texture of the beer. A nice mix if you can get past the first palate clearing sip.","Fortville, Indiana, USA","mocarmel"
1019,"2006-03-08",4.7,"Just a huge, classy, but muscular Imperial Stout. Pours inky black and as thick and viscous as year old motor oil. Develops a thin slick of a deep tan head. Luscious, rich aromas of roasted espresso beans, dark semi-sweet chocolate, molasses and a faint smokiness waft up from the snifter. The palate is near perfection; syrupy thick and oily with a restrained minimal  level of carbonation. This is the mouthfeel all big Imperial style beers should attain. The first sip is a life changing experience. Intense flavors of melted dark chocolate and espresso are initially noted followed by a pleasing molasses/maple syrup/dark fruit sweetness. The finish shows off a subtle presence of the alcohol to warm things up with a late palate appearance of a hefty hop bitterness to cut down the sweetness of the immense malt profile. An amazing, close to perfection beer. One that shouldnt be missed.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Rauchbier smokiness greets my nostrils and Im pleased. Meaty roasts & soy make me salivate as my mouth expects a meal, not a beer... and a meal is what I get! (A rich and thick dessert, anyway.) Nearly the consistency of fresh latex housepaint, the flavor starts with a Hersheys syrup start, coating the mouth with chocolate before deep, espresso roasts slowly drag behind and linger. (Some swigs begin too heavily sugared, but not to the point where Im put off.) Raisin and plum emerge in the aftertaste as a fruity complement to the rich flavors. Simply gorgeous in all respects.

An acidic, dark malt greets you in the nose; followed by some sweeter notes of rich chocolate and a hint of burnt coffee as well as some spruce-like hoppiness. Its restrained, exceptionally fine-bubbled carbonation and light-medium body leaves it silky smooth across the palate. The flavor is bold without being overdone. Dark malt acidity greets you upfront (its definitely not acetic or lactic, but it is somewhat tart), followed by some mild notes of bittersweet chocolate, and then some sweeter notes of creamy caramel. Restrained, but distinctly spruce-like hops appear immediately at the swallow; and help to usher in its dry and lingering earthy finish.

Rerate (July 25, 2006)
The appearance is unchanged.  However, the aroma is remarkably different!  Theres still strong alcohol, but accompanied by a barleywine-like bubblegum sweetness.  Roast coffee and chocolate are still there, but subtle. Also a much more noticable hop presence.  As it got warmer, a brownie sort of aroma started appearing.   I added 3 points for this rather than three because I feel it to be more or less outside of the style.  The palate is still mind blowing.  The flavors are improved slight too.  The alcohol has dropped back, giving way to chocolate up front, with a bit of roast.  Floral hops really come through and accentuate the roast.  The big bubblegumish and alcohol come through very strongly. Theres also a changing aftertaste that starts on brownies and ends up in roast and alcohol.  1 point added for flavor.  I have 4 more of these saved up waiting to be drank, but Im going to have patience, and wait until autumn to try the next one.  Another 3 points on overall added.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Pours a thick black color with a tan head- about a half an inch worth but I really forced the pour.  Warm chocolate aromas with a good deal of hoppiness.

Pours double shot espresso dark with a small light brown head that quickly diminshes with good lacing.  Opaque, light will not penatrate this.  The scent floating to my nose reminds my of roasted molasses, smokey oak aged burbon, the hops shout a you and the malt is fighting it for attention.  Theres a lot going on and my nose cant take it all in.  This is a full bodied beer, be prepared.  It has a creamy almost syrupy texture with a soft carbonation.  A perfect beer to sit and listen to your favorite album (yes vinyl).  On to the best part the flavor, yum.  Malt sweetness first hit, then some alcohol.  The hops start kicking in to balance the initial sweetness then your palate realizes there a whole bunch more going on here.  Smoke flavors, soft chocolate, subtle grape, roasted grains, caramel, espresso and even vanilla more than I can take.  It just gets better as it breaths and warms.  You are aware of the alcohol but would not guess its over 11%.  This is the best Imperial stout I have ever had, complex and yummy.  Hats off to Bells!!","Chaska, Minnesota, USA","MrBrewski"
1019,"2006-01-24",5.0,"Bells Expedition Stout pours to an ink black, dark as midnight, opaque, color, this beer is as black as shoe polish. The head is big, tan, thick, and creamy. The nose on this beer is stunning. TITANIC malt aromas and hop aromas flood the nose. Big roasty and chocolate malt aromas marry with aromas of black licorice, and peppery waves of alcoholic strength. If that is not enough there is HUGE hop aromas as well. Bells Expedition has two times the malt of their Kalamazoo Stout, but has a whopping five times the hops!! The hop aromatics in this beer, are so fresh, piney, and citric. It does battle with the malt for your nostrils attention. Now for the palate. AMAZING. Huge malt flavors of chocolate malt, roast, coffee, expresso, licorice, toffee, and vanilla coat the tongue. The body is as big as mother Russia. This is a rich, hefty, lush body, very viscous, like motor oil. The finish. As incredible as the start. Big chocolate malt, expresso, licorice, and roasted malt flavors lead into a big, long, dry, citric, hop bitter finish. At five times the hops, and Bells loves hops, this beer has to be 100 IBUs. The finish is very warming as well. Bells Expedition clocks in at about 10-11% abv, this is some potent stuff. 

Words can not do this beer justice. One has to experience a beer like this. I know it was worth a trip to Michigan for me. As stated, this is an amazing beer. It is rich and complex, with just layer, after layer of flavors. A beer as decadent as this should be sipped and savored. If you want to match this with food, only desert would do. This would go perfect with a big thick slice of death by chocolate cake, dark chocolates, and chocolate pudding.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Chewy, heavy...very heavy...a great dessert beer and/or nightcap.

Theres hops, dark chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel, dried fruit and just the right amount of alcohol. It smells...divine, yeah thats the word, divine. The flavour is no slouch, its downright delicious. It starts with a nice hop kick followed by chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit and finally some alcohol. Its all so perfectly balanced, I hate to use that word again but its just so fu**ing delicious! Mouthfeel is full, smooth and creamy and goes down ridiculously easy for an 11.5% beer, its quite impressive actually.

Taste; wow, those roasted choclate malts really hit right up front, with a little bit of the cooffee blanded in. Theres a slight bitterness for the hops, but those are somewhat subdued due to some age. I get a little bit of a vinous and molasses flavors as this warms, with a little bit of an alcohol bite.

Cant wait to find out how this one ages after cellaring it for a year.

(Batch 7205) After letting some sit for a year I think it deserves to be bumped up in both aroma and appearance.  The sticky palate lingers and every sip gives new and exciting flavors.

In classic I.S. fashion, there is the thinnest of heads, dark oily brown.  You can tell this is thick on the pour - the last drops just hang, dribbling out one at a time.
This is one of the chocolatiest stouts ever, dominating the aroma.  Deep coffee flavors, with some tart cherries in the background.

1019,"2005-12-09",5.0,"My scores are going to be largely out of line with everyone elses, but my only explanation for this is that the Expedition may be a hit-and-miss beer. This is my first time experiencing it so its possible I stumbled across one of their better batches aged for just long enough to blend the flavors perfectly. Anyway, disclaimer out of the way, here we go:

Pours pitch black with a gorgeous (almost edible) milk chocolate head, with dense packs of carb bubbles clinging seductively to the sides of the glass.

Smells of brown sugar, molasses, a touch of black licorice, and dark malt, all of which blends into a bouquet far more inviting and less intrusive than other beers of this abv magnitude.

Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, very milkshake like, leaving a sticky coating on the lips and tongue.

Cholocate and sugars predominant up front followed by dark roasted malt on finish. Superb flavoring - all other ingredients whiffed before drinking blend so well into the chocolate and malt as to be almost individually imperceptible. Alcohol is unbelievably well hidden, probably the best that Ive ever seen for this strong of a brew. 

Although the alcohol does eventually make its presence known, its more in the ""gullet burn"" than in the taste. You really have to be looking for it on the tongue to even realize its there. No perceptible way to improve this beer at all in my eyes, so perfect 5.0s all around. I do believe this one has slipped into my top 5. I plan on having more very soon so well see if the honeymoon period lasts.","Austin, Texas, USA","julrey"

The taste really improves depending upon how long it has aged.  I would suggest letting it age for at least a few months.  After time passes, some of the rough edges are eliminated.

As for the stout, very, very rich and full-bodied, high-alcohol...makes Guinness taste like a light beer.   Its taste is hard to describe...very unique, fairly strong coffee taste.

Stone Impy stout has more alcohol presence than this monster. This beer is dangerously drinkable. Mouthfeel is thick and oily. Very complex flavors. Typical impy stout characteristics but it seems to take those to the extreme. Bitterness seems to lend more towards roasty bitterness rather than hops. Very sweet malty caramel taste. Upon my last sip, I could see a good deal of sediment, which is typical of bottle-conditioned beers, but this was A LOT of sediment.

Poured thick oily black with ruby highlights, an average fairly dark brown head - head is bigger when it warms - what an impy stout should look like.  Aroma is a nice medley of dark chocolate, strong roast coffee, prunes, raisins, some hops and interesting vinous, woody and lactic notes too.  Mouthfeel is extremely thick and creamy, as well as which just sets off the fine balance between the coffee bitterness and the roast malt - and the stewed prune and red wine character adds tartness, but incredibly this one finishes sweet, with almost a sarsaparilla finish, which gets progressively more bitter as it approaches room temperature.

But then I crack open one of these things and I have to control my gag reflex. And its not just because Im a wimp either. I enjoy some of the high alcohol Belgians. Its official, I hate Imperial Stout. This thing tastes like stout mixed with perfume and vodka.","Garden City, Michigan, USA","UnsofistaCat"
1019,"2005-11-24",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2010 From Bottle packaged on February 25, 2006 (aged since 2006 in my cellar). Re-rated (June 7, 2010). Poured like a good motor oil. Pitch black. No head. Strong coffee, chocolate, hop aroma. Flavor hits you with chocolate, and malts, coffee in the middle, finishing up with fruity cherries. Texture thin. Finish is a little astringent and bitter. This one is a sipper still after 4 years. Still as good now as it was then.

From Bottle

Poured motor oil black, georgous tan head, quickly disappaiting. Aroma of rich roasted coffee. Taste of roasted coffee with hints of dark chocolate. Mildly bitter aftertaste. Thick, just like a stout should be. Perfect for a cold winter night, such as tonight. 11.5% alcohol completely hidden. Palate is lingering, and creamy mouthful. Again, Bells proves why they are becoming one of my favorite brews","Pennsylvania, USA","SB"
1019,"2005-11-22",4.4,"Wonderful aroma to it, I could just sniff it all day.  Nice full, dark color to it.  Deep, coffee flavor, tastes very good.  Thick, full body, with little carbonation to get in the way.  This is a very good beer.","Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, USA","LePoopie"
1019,"2005-11-20",4.5,"Vinous aroma of chocolate, coffee, plum, and roasty malt.  Appears a thick, opaque chocolate brown with deep brown creamy head that dissipates immediately.  Flavor is absolutely huge and vinous, with chocolate syrup notes over big roasted malt.  Palate is thick, syrupy, creamy and lingering.  Overall, this beer delivers a knock-out punch and it is not at all what I expected, even with the highest ratings.  It is also equal to the sum of its parts.

1019,"2005-11-09",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2008 Rerate:  Id say my palate has evolved quite a bit in the 2 years since I first had Expedition.  Picked up a six-pack from The Hop Shop in Indy.  No batch # on the bottle.  Black pour with a big, dark, frothy head.   Bitter chocolate and roasted malt aroma.  Tasted pretty intensely of chocolate, roasted malt, and plenty of piney hops.  This tastes aged, only in the sense that the hops arent overbearing and green (like say, drinking a fresh Bourbon County Stout).  Very complex flavor, even though I probably drank this too fast bc I got excited that it tasted so good.  Probably would have gotten even more out of it had I waited longer for it to warm.  Nice medium-thick mouthfeel really brings everything together nicely.  Excellent imperial stout!  

Thanks to richlikebeer for this one.  Pours a jet black with a quickly fading mocha colored head.  Lots of coffee and raisin aromas.  Full bodied, oily mouthfeel.  Very smooth beer with lots of flavor to it, but its just a little too roasted for me.  Ill stick to the milder and sweeter Kzoo Stout if I want a Bells stout.  Thanks Rich!

Flavor is so rich and delicious, one of the first thoughts that comes to my head is to put a little of this on some good homemade vanilla ice cream (i know, kind of random).

It has the right amount of carbonation for my taste and this SWEET stout is a rich balance with rasin hops and malts.

The sweetness is definately the dominating charactistic in this selection and there is a slight coffee aroma w/o being bitter anywhere in the mouth.","Maryland, USA","9er"
1019,"2005-10-08",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2007 (Rerate)  Ok, lets try this again.  Thin dense dark brown head of very fine bubbles.  Recedes to a thin spotty wisp of foam.  Very respectable head reappears upon swirling.  Intense sweet and roasty aroma.  Raisins, brown sugar, cocoa and sweet and roasty malts.  Quite yummy.  Rich and roasty flavor too.  Noticable alcohol presence and warming.  Loads of roasted malts, brown sugar, bittersweet dark chocolate and some dark coffee late swallow.  Still a little zippy in the mouth from a slight sourness/tartness.  Finish is long and creamy and very roasty.  Leaves the gums tingling from the alcohol.  A pretty damn good impy but not quite as good as I expected.  Rating adjusted.





(2003)  I am very worried about this brew from the looks of it.  Poured from at least 8 inches into my glass and got absolutely no head.  No bubbles, no foam, no nothing.  There should have been something there.  Thick black and syrupy looking.  Roasty and oxidized aroma.  Slight funk sourness with a bit of soy sauce and smoke.  Little reddish brown around the edges.  Flavor is rich and malty.  Not much sourness there.  Big alcohol kick with roasted grains, molassas, dark chocolate.  Very thick and syrupy.  Almost cough syrup like.  Flat in the mouth.  Something is definately off with this one.  There was quite a bit of head space in this bottle for it to be good for aging.  Finish is strong and roasty and grainy.  Leaves an oily coating in the mouth.  Will have to try this one again as I think that there is something wrong with this bottle.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

1019,"2005-10-03",4.6,"12 oz bottle, 11/2004 vintage.  Pours completely black, very little head that disappeared to a thin ring clinging to the inside of my snifter.  A few chunkies fell in from the bottle, but a good amount of yeasties forming a cake in the bottom of the bottle.  This is what an Imperial Stout looks like.  Aroma of bitter dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, coffee, molasses, some alcohol, and licorice.  Flavor is really well balanced for the amount of malt and alcohol in here.  Burnt toast, roasted malt, coffee, deep hop bitterness, dark chocolate.  This beer has it all.  Mouthfeel is oily and full bodied, but not cloying at all.  This also has the perfect amount of carbonation for me personally.  Almost still in the mouth, with soft carbonation.  Finish is dominated by roasted malt but a sufficient amount of hoppiness to cut through and reveal the full range of flavors.  With 11.5% alcohol, youd think that you would be able to taste it, but other than in the aroma, there really is no trace of it.  This is the epitome of the style.  I have a dozen or so to see how this one develops in the cellar.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Completely opaque and in this rare case, i will compare its appearance to looking like used motor oil. Not much of a head created but a little brown and pink colored topping sat for a moment before breaking up. The aroma is rich in roasted malt and also shows signs of chocolate milk.  Dark flavor of roasted and slightly burnt malts with a heaping hop presence. Very strong in its intensity while showing a sweet raisin taste in the beginning. Both bitter and rich, it could also be said that this might be the closest resemblance to coffee i ever tasted in a stout or in any other beer for that matter.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Very light hint of resin. The flavor is heavily sweet and lightly bitter. That remained through the finish. The heavy bitterness in the finish is gone though the alochol is evident.

A good beer but I couldnt see myself drinking more then one of these unless it was winter time.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"
1019,"2005-06-09",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2005 12 oz.  Thanks a bundle to OhioDad.   Very very thick black pour.  Opaque in the glass with a full brown head over it that didnt last long.  Smells like coffee and roast, with some sharp hop notes.  Incredibly full, thick mouthfeel.  The flavor is exceptionally full and complex roasted malt with a sharp hop bitterness that follows.  The alcohol, while present, was not overpowering but did warm as you swallow.  This is a luxurious, sinful beer.  Exceptional.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Jonathan3584"
1019,"2005-06-09",4.5,"From bottle.  With a moderate pour, a rich, satin brown head developed.  The beer itself was as opaque black as youd expect from an imperial stout.  Nose of roasty coffee and chocolate, alcohol vapor, caramelized sugar and molasses.  Flavor was quite similar along with some crystal malt sweetness and a tad of acidity.  Hops lend a satisfying bitterness to complement that of the roasted malt.  Alcohol was still definitely present but not to the point of being detracting.  Was on the drier side of the Imperial stout spectrum.  The mouthfeel was thick like a milkshake and very smooth.  One of the top IS Ive had the pleasure of trying along with Old Rasputin, Stone RIS, and Brooklyn BCS.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","BlueDevil0206"
1019,"2005-06-03",4.3,"Bottle. Pours black with a compact mahogany head, completely opaque, intricate lacing left behind on my snifter. Aroma is mostly roasty and chocolatey, also caramel and alcohol notes, not overpowering at all. Flavor is a lot of chocolate, hints of coffee, lots of roastiness and a bit of a harsh matiness, ethanol taste, and the finish is exceedingly bitter. Mouthfeel is rich, lightly carbonated, a little oily. Overall, a great brew, though I think that Speedway and the Stone Imperials are certainly a clear step above. In any event, still a real treat. Ill proably drink another one of these and cellar the rest of my six-pack to see how the flavors develop over time.","Santa Barbara, California, USA","MayorQuimby"
1019,"2005-05-29",4.3,"Almost zero head...Motor oil color.  Rich and creamy mouth feel, interrupted by a slight nip of carbonation, coating the tongue with roasted malt aftertaste.  Starts sweet on the tongue but rapidly contorts to a strong bitter malty flavor.  Definate chocolate and coffee presence.  This beer has a very heavy feel to it.  Very good!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","ahole"

1019,"2005-05-24",4.1,"Bottle Finally, my 100th rating.  Pours beautiful and black.  Thick and black.  Lots of sediment at the bottom.  Aroma was good, albeit a little weak for an impy stout.  It had the typical smell of chocolate, coffee, licorice, and chocolate covered cherries.  First sip ... boy is that roasty.  Loads of roasted malts in there.  At first, it finishes very dry from the malts and a slight hint of hops in the background.  Toward the second half of the bottle, it gets a little sweeter, and theres tastes of dark chocolate and dark fruits.  Like all impy stouts, the mouthfeel is full and chewy.  It reminded me a lot of Brooklyn Black Chocolate, but a little dryer and roastier.  Dont get me wrong, this was good, but the roastiness was a bit over the top.

Excellent aroma of thick, round, rich roasted malt, chocolate and subdued alcohol. Amazing flavor of rich roasted malt,chocolate with a strong bitter finish.

1019,"2005-05-19",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2005 Thanks to Matta for this most appreciated b-day gift. If it is true that high viscosity oil helps protect engine parts from thermal breakdown then I am now ready for a trip to the sun. Talk about thick! It really does make glup sounds as it plops into the bottle. I love stouts and porters, but I tend not to like Imperial Stouts. This IS while a dream to look at and having near perfect mouthfeel,  was too much for my tastebuds. The huge level of hops and burnt malty flavors just overwhelm me. I know some folks cant get enough, but then some folks like the taste of oysters and soy sauce. It is definitely a very unique beer which is why I rate it highly, but I personally would never seek out another.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"
1019,"2005-05-17",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2005 Poured a powerful opaque black with thin caramel head.  Aroma consisted of a massive amount of roasted coffee and chocolate malts.  Coffee, chocolate, caramel, nutmeg, and a hint of cinnamon assaulted the taste buds.  The complexity of this beer enveloped and assaulted each and every one of my taste buds.  There was bitterness from the hops and the dark chocolate... roasted chocolate and coffee from the malts... and various spices.  Very well balanced.  Beer was creamy and thick, almost to the point of being chewy.  Aftertaste was as if I just finished a fine cup of coffee or some espresso... only the warming effect was not from the temperature of the beverage :)  Fantastic!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1019,"2005-05-10",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2005 Bumping this blessed beer up a point in flavor because it is consistently one of the best damn beers on Gods green earth.  The original review...Oh yeah.  Thick ass pour and black as night.  I think I even saw some sediment chunk out near the end.  Head looks like a spider web thinly stretched over dewed grass in the morning, with some skittish tan coloring along the inside edge of the snifter.  Aroma is laden with roasted malt, molasses, dark chocolate and charred hazelnuts.  Rich, rich, rich.  Hits the mouth and is thick and delicious.  Roasted malts are prominently featured.  Flavoring suggests slow-dripped French roast coffee.  Taste evolves from the initial dark, semi-sweet chocolate visage to a creamy milk chocolate complexity in the aftertaste.  Bells has nearly achieved perfection with this one.  Splendid bitterness with a malt backbone so thick that you could eat this with a spoon.   Sinisterly dense as can be.  Slowly oozes across the palate.  I bet my teeth will now permanently bare marks inflicted by this mother load.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1019,"2005-05-08",4.5,"(12 oz bottles: Obtained in trades with Goblincat and hopsrus, thanks Mike and John!) Back when I lived in DC, my Bud-swilling buddy used to call any dark beer ""motor oil.""  He has no idea.  This brew pours with such thick viscosity, it may well be actual motor oil.  I mean, Kalamazoo is only a few hours from the Motor City, right?  He should see this stuff.  Totally black in color.  I turn on a bright light and hold the beer up to it.  Nothing.  Absolutely and totally impenetrable, even at the edges of the glass.  For a few seconds, there isn’t even a hint of a head, but slowly, it builds to about an eighth of an inch.  Light brown in color, but very small and a bit dissappointing.  Fades away to a small halo before I even take my first sip.  The nose is amazing though.  Quite roasty, a bit hoppy, and a fair amount of alcohol, but what hits me the most is the earthy, mushroomy aroma, which is one of my favorite aromas in a beer.  It’s a perfect lead in for my first taste.  Whoa!  Massive roast, very bitter but twice as sweet.  Underlying the huge roast is that earthy, mushroomy flavor, pretty strong in its own right, but still nearly overwhelmed by the roast, but it’s this earthiness that really makes this one of top Imperial Stouts.  Intense, dark fruit, like prune but more intense.  Molasses.  Fairly smoky in the finish.  There’s so much flavor, I don’t think it matters what you’ve had to eat or drink before this, Expedition will obliterate it from your palate, and prevent you from tasting anything else for hours.  Rich, sticky, and thick mouthfeel, coats every crevice of the mouth.  Nearly syrupy, but not thick enough to slowly slide down the glass which I’ve seen with a few Imperial Stouts along the way.  Lots of alcohol in the flavor and nose, I think I’m already feeling it in my head.  I’m gonna have a slight buzz by the time I finish this glass, I know it.  I love Imperial Stouts, but now that I’ve had Expedition, Speedway and Peche Mortel, I know for sure that this isn’t my favorite style of beer.  Close, but not my favorite.  Perhaps Expedition is a bit too ""palate bashing"", but this is still an incredible beer in almost all respects.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
1019,"2005-05-07",4.7,"The poured out an opaque ink black with a huge brown head I had to sip to keep from spilling over the glass. Great retention and chunks of lace left decorating the glass as I consumed this. Aroma is thick with dark chocolate and roasty coffee as well as a touch of fruit and some other unidentifiables. I will have to try and figure out more with my other bottle. The flavor was similar with a strong chocolate taste and notes of roasted malt and espresso. Dark fruits were also in the mix as well as some earthy hops. The finish was a mixed of roasted malts, hop bitterness and a slight alcohol bit. Excellent all around flavor that I couldnt ask any more of. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Damn good drinkability here. Great all around Russian Imperial Stout that is near the top of my favorites.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"
1019,"2005-05-07",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2005 Pours black like espresso with a thin but lasting brown head.  Aroma scared me a bit at first because I detected some kind of weird olive smell, but that melted away to roasty chocolate and coffee, toffee, again lots of dark chocolate.  Flavor is very potent, bitter chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, with a slight sweetness.  Other, subtler flavors present, but they were overpowered to the point that I couldnt really identify them.  Long bitter aftertaste.  Feels full, smooth, and thick in the mouth with just enough carbonation.  Very bitter, though, in the aftertaste, to the point that I couldnt finish an entire 12-oz. bottle.  Its almost like drinking espresso- a little is more than enough.","Michigan, USA","Incubus1981"

Rich and complex nose of  dark chocolate, caramel, roasted coffee, vanilla bean, and brown sugar, with an underlying tone of ruby port.  The flavor is a near perfect balance with huge dark chocolate, coffee, and caramel notes up front, nice bitter hoppiness spread throughout, and more sweet darkened malt again in the end.  11%+ ABV is expertly hidden.  Ultra full bodied and thick, pillow soft carbonation, bittersweet finish.  Not really sure how you can get better then this.  Unreal!!","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"

Some sheery-like aromatics, with a hint of coffee and of course the requisite roastiness.  Acrid fruit nose, later becomes caramel and chocolate in flavor.  This melds into a deep roastiness that pairs well with the alcohol bite.  The finish maintains the semblence of roastiness.  Mouthfeel is so thick it is almost oily.

1019,"2005-04-24",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2005 Pours like motor oil black as night with very little brown head just ringing the outside of the glass.  Deducting a point on appearance because there is no head at all.  There is no light at all making it through this one.  Aroma is coffee, some dark chocolate and caramel.  Taste is very much roasted malt with hints of coffee, chocolate and molasses.  This is very smooth for an imperial.  Very drinkable and the high alcohol content is very well hidden.  On the palate this is thick and coating in the mouth.  A little bitter at the end but not much and it doesnt take long to feel its warming effect.  There are so many flavors dancing around in this one you just dont know which one to comment on.  The flavor gets better with each sip as it warms some toffee coming out at the end.

Mine poured with no head whatsoever like it was flat but all six bottles were like this so...I dunno.  Aroma of strong molasses and coffee.  The tastes truly are too many to handle at once.  Again, molasses, chocolate, bitter black licorice, and coffee, and enough malt to choke you.  Apparently if you are not used to strong beer you will consider this very bitter but I didnt notice it that much.  Others around me who tasted said they thought it was extremely bitter.

I picked up bitter coffee, chocolate, raisin, toffee and caramel and  hops.  The taste was very alcoholic but well balanced.  It was like a chocolate version of the Barley Wine.

1019,"2005-04-15",5.0,"I have been waiting for the perfect moment, but as Passover approaches, I could not wait any longer.  I opened the Expedition Stout last night, and drank it slowly over the course of 2 hours, witnessing its texture, taste and aroma evolve and morph.  By the end, some sediment had extricated itself from the frothy, malty stuff so that the grog had an ever-so-slight element of ""graininess"" which reunited me with the source of the beer itself, in fact the source of all beer.  By 11:15 PM, my ebony companion nearly gone, but still clinging to life within the lower 1/4 inch of my glass, never more complex or generous than it was at that moment, I determined that one of the finest compliments one could give to such a wort would be not to drink the final swill just for the sake of finishing it, but rather to let it rest peacefully in its new home, as I drifted to sleep, knowing that by the time I awoke, it would have passed into the stage most like death for a beer--undrinkability.

Milk chocholate aroma with no hint of alcohol. Huge brown, fine-bubble head that slowly cascades up through the engine oil body. Beautiful lace. Not used to seeing lace this dark. Head is lasting.

Looking forward to aging some of this, interested to see how it can possibly get better.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
1019,"2005-02-24",4.4,"Bottle.  After 2 terrible tastings tonight, I decided to pull out one of the Ratebeer ""Big Boys"" to save the day.  It truly was salvation.  Pours black as the Ace of spades with no real head to speak of, just some dark tan bubbles that cling to the side of the glass like cobwebs...  chunks of sediment splashed up and hit me in the face as I poured, and we have lots of floaters in the glass.  Nose is of raisins, prunes, fully roasted malts, some light hop aroma sneaks in and some malt sweetness as well, sort of like a liqueur.  Burnt toffee and burnt toast hit the buds at first as a creamy, buttery, and silky liquid eases across the tongue and slides down the throat.  Thick viscous body with not much carbonation, but nice.... never had a brew like this in terms of palate.  Very nice beer.  I sure wish that my Uncle JZ was still with us to enjoy this one.  This is definitely his kind of brew.  An alcohol burn sneaks in at the finish as the burnt flavors mix on the back of the tongue quite nicely.  As the beer warms, a sweetness emerges and combines well with the hops and the malt bitterness.  This is top-notch stuff and I highly recommend this beer to all who enjoy the malt and hop.","Sligo","pjk33"

1019,"2005-02-14",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2009 Bottle.  Finally got around to rerating this awesome beer.  I have made a couple of adjustments after trying loads of other imperial stouts.  Simply put, I added to perfect scores for flavor and palate from 9 and 4, respectively.  I simply see no way that this could be bettered in those categories.  
Pours thick and so-dark with a orangish brown head.  Aromas of burnt malt and chocolate which are also some of the first tastes.  Subtle cream and nutmeg with orange (?) undertones are also there as is one heck of a kick that gives a nice warm sensation as it goes down.  Great stuff...","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
1019,"2005-02-11",4.7,"Cellar Temp. Pours deep stout brown. Maintains a small deep brown head. Aroma is great, malty, warm, and chocolaty. This is like liquid chocolate with sharp alcoholic notes. Thick, creamy mouthfeel.  Great progression from front to back. Ends with a solid bitterness coated in a warm alcoholic burn. A pretty glorious stout.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","green"

The best stout Ive had yet!!!","Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, USA","Ray1975"
1019,"2005-02-11",4.7,"The blackest, thickest beer Ive ever seen. I was tempted to feel some between my fingers to see it felt as thick as it looked. A big thick layer of creamy dark carmel head with little dark flecks. Very persistent, leaving thick sticky lace on the glass. Stunningly beautiful stuff. Aromas of chocolate, cognac, figs. Creamy. Very strong without being harsh.  Bitter chocolate, really sweet carmel roasts that burst in the mouth for just a moment and then transition to warming dry alcohol. Nice graininess and peaty smoke. Palate is vast and mouthfilling, and with slow sipping, very smooth. This is so amazingly good! It would be fun to lay a few bottles down to age...but I cant really imagine it getting better than it is now. Besides, any closer to perfection and the gods would be angry and curse the people at Kalamazoo, and I dont want to be responsible for that.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

1019,"2005-02-08",2.6,"12 oz. brown, longneck bottle. No freshness date seen anywhere. Hey, KBC, how about a freshness date? What? Would it kill you to do it? Ill digress. Poured out a deep chocolate brown color, with a tan colored head.
Aromas are of roasted malts, stale coffee, and alcohols. Some wine soaked prune aromas as well. Flavors of over-roasted coffee beans, along with some charcoal notes. Medium body, coats the tongue well. Slight bitterness from the hops, but still unbalanced, IMHO.","","Cobra"
1019,"2005-02-03",4.0,"Inky black with a medium brown head.  Aromas of roasted espresso malt, resin hops and a hint of raisin.  Flavor is well balanced.  A lightly sweet roasted flavor changing to a very bitter finish which mellows to a toasted chocolaty-espresso aftertaste.  Palate is full, but not as full as some.  Oily texture with a soft carbonation. The raisin-fruit taste comes out as it warms.  It took me 45 minutes to finish this bottle.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
1019,"2005-01-30",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2013 2003 Bottle. Pours a glistening supple pitch black, with a sheen of glossy opalescense. Finely rimmed with a pencil line of tan. Aroma flows of milky belgian chocolate, tangy black currant jam, and a shot of espresso. Some coarser wild chokecherry and rustic woodsmoke notes intermingle. A gentle warming from mulled wine rises from the depths, pushing aside more gentle ginger snaps and boughs of cedar. A lascivious syrup of dexterity. Oily, dense and concentrated yet showing forth such dainty and finely hued tones, building into a firey inferno of charred animal flesh amongst a scene of strength and barbaric savagry. At first, gentle dark berries, blackberry, currants and some black cherries jogging side by side with a constant flow of whipped hazlenut butter and clotted cream. Building further into rushing madness of unecumbered dry toast and barbeque. Fresh seared ahi amongst crumbled blue cheese and walnuts. Delicate, yet bold. Palate remains somewhat unrefined, show hints of a gin habit and a penchant for a warm chocolate pipe during a morning fishing session. Mellowed from the years.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1019,"2005-01-27",4.2,"Bottle thanks to styles: Deep, dark brown that is near black with the tiniest of heads, colored tan brown.  This smells quite rich and has some vinous qualities.  Plenty of roasted malt and chocolate combine with plum, cherry, wet cardboard (not as in infected), and some restrained spicy yeast or spicy hops to give a dark aroma.  Full bodied with light carbonation and a slick, velvety palate.  The mouth feel is just fantastic here - lightly spritzy carbonation, full, creamy, thick, and yet very drinkable.  The taste is full of roasted malt, coffee, burnt chocolate, port, red wine, cherry, chalk, tar, a light spicyness, and a slight alcohol burn towards the end.  Glad I asked for a few bottle of this so I can see how it lays down for a few years.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

Id never had a 3 year old Exped., and Chris was kind enough to send one my way.  huge nose of chocolate with a flavor profile of chocolate, roasted malts and assorted  ripe fruit.  bumped up my score by .4.  now I know to age this bad boy!

bottle.  picked up at a bottle shop in Champaign.  Right now Im just really pissed.  I just spilled an Avery New World Porter all over my computer desk.  I drank about 2/3 of it before spilling, but it was so good and it was the only one I had :(  So to cheer myself up I opened the only Expedition that I picked up at the same place.  This is a big beer, a very big beer.  Many stouts are a dark brown, but this on is BLACK.  The aromas and flavors are of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee.  Well balanced and tasty, the alcohol is well hidden.    An excellent stout but there has been a couple of others I liked better.","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
1019,"2005-01-25",4.8,"Pours so thick and full.  Nice head with superior lacing.  Slight smell of alcohol in it.    Tastes of expresso, chocolate.  Leaves a strange aftertaste for an imperial stout.  Almost makes me think of grapefruit (Hops?)?  Am I crazy?  I couldnt taste the alcohol as much as I smelled it.  I like this very very much.","Eureka, Missouri, USA","darkstar"
1019,"2005-01-25",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2006 This poured black, oh so black.  The dark brown head was so tempting as it grew and grew. Tight bubbles of pleasure. The aroma was almost of burnt coffee, the kind in the awful quickie mart that burnt all day. But this also has a sweet back note, and finishes with a slight bit oh pine like hops. The first taste is like the aroma, but also adds some caramel and the low carbonation helps the hops in the finish. The mouth feel is heavy. There is a thick bread like quality, and I am, loving this. I got a some small amount of this on my lips and they a stinking together and, Oh I love this. I got one from Duane, and one from Wohlfs. Thanx guys. This was liquid love, heaven on earth. 
re-rate. This bottle is rated on 11-1-05. And it is sooo much thicker. Great, as always.

Flavor roasty coffee, alcohol evaporation and warmth in throat and stomach; mostly coffee/roast, but some chocolate and more lightly vanilla.  Thick but too sticky.  Too much roast/coffee for my tastes; very good though certainly a bit overrated.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"
1019,"2005-01-22",4.3,"Thanks to Mr. Facto for this beer.

Pours thick onyx with a fizzy dark brown head that dissipated quickly.  Heavy chocolate aroma.  Taste is mostly of bittersweet chocolate with a prevelant alcohol sweetness (cherry character?) and burn.  The bitterness soon takes over and moves into a finish of chocolate-covered espresso beans.  The body is full and thick, which I have come to expect from Bells stouts.  The best imperial stout Ive had thus far.  However, for the purposes of casual drinking, I think Id be more apt to turn to the java or kalamazoo stout.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Gets a 20 overall.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"
1019,"2005-01-08",4.6,"2003 version I believe...I am so glad I can get this any time!  Pours a deep mahogany-closer to black with burgundy hints at the edges.  No head at all.  The aroma is dark chocolate with espresso bean and bourbon.  Also a hint of sweetness (molasses?).  The flavor reminds me of a chocolate covered espresso bean with a bit of dried cherry in there (deep down).  Its nice and bitter (perhaps a citrus type hop?) but well balanced.  Delicious and flavorful!  Rich! and somewhat oily mouth feel; really coats your tongue.  An exceptional brew!","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

1019,"2005-01-03",4.0,"I thought Id accidentally grabbed a bottle of chocolate syrup until after the pour when the dark brown head began to increase to a three-finger topping to this pitch black brew.  The aroma is of sweet but dark roasted malts with a touch of hopping and a hint of alcohol.  This is very creamy in the mouth with some light carbonation.  The flavor is of slighty sweet, roasted malt, burnt chocolate, mild hop bitterness, and some alcohol.  Nice warming, roasty, alcohol finish.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
1019,"2005-01-02",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2008 Thick chocolate head.  Dark in color.  Head looks a lot like hot chocolate.  Aroma was of hop and coffee malt with a slight grapefruit scent and alcohol overtones.  Palate had good carbonation.  It was a little sticky.  The slightly creamy palate gets really thick and wonderful when you let it rest in your mouth for 20 seconds.  I retried this again.  It is more appealing each time.  Other than the slight alcohol finish, this is as good as it gets (in what Ive tried) for imperial stouts.  Although, Im soon to purchase a bunch of Dark Lords...  :)  8, 5, 9, 4, 18 = 4.4

(7+) Flavour is mostly rich malt with a deep vein of vinous fruit notes through it, roast notes show up, especially in the finish where they linger long into the aftertaste. (7+) Smooth, oily medium to full bodied palate. Still rather nice, but I think it has lost a step while waiting in the queue in my fridge. 7/4/8/4/15 - 3.9 Bottle, approximately 2 years old, shared with Mabel.

<P>November 2004. Deep black body with a gorgeous dark tan head. Beautifully subtle but omnipresent aroma of dark chocolate and fruit is overcome for a moment by a surge of alcohol with a swirl of the glass. Thick oily palate. The flavour expedition is lead by a dark rich chocolate guide, immediately followed by the bossy and less cordial assistant, roasty bitterness. Very nicely balanced, leaning towards the bitter side.  Touch of hops and alcohol linger in the finish. Was blown away by how much I actually liked this. Thanks VERY much for this bottle Gunny.

1019,"2004-11-25",4.8,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2008 Pours thick and black, with a nice size cappuccino head. The head subsides after time and leaves good lacing. Tasted at 54 degrees out of the cellar (basement closet). Malty, inviting aroma. The beer is really full with huge flavors such as coffee/chocolate, with a nice kick of hops to give it a floral? taste and a dry, bitter (in a good way) finish. Its like drinking a beautiful stout/porter and a great IPA all in one beer. I bought 2 six-packs; hopefully I can let some age for a while and see how it changes, though that might prove difficult.   Re-rate:  Tasted as part of a 7 beer imperial stout/porter tasting. Dark black color with a thin tan head, coats the glass!  Citrus peels, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate aroma.  The flavor comes in waves. Initially its all malt, then citrus peels and bittersweet chocolate covered cherries/raspberries, then cocoa and a hint of coffee. Dry finish with incredible flavor. The consistency is like whole milk. This is what an imperial stout should taste like.  
2002 bottle tasted in Dec 07 Thanks Indra! This has been cellaring for 5+ years. Aroma is cocoa, molasses, roast, dark rum, coffee ice cream. Taste is roasty and sweet with dark fruits and some lighter fruits, anise, and sweet cream. The flavor is very smooth and lacks the malt/hops peaks and valleys of a younger expedition. It is a graceful older beer that seems to have lost some of its brashness, but is more a of a regal older gentleman.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
1019,"2004-11-24",4.3,"Arriving as a part of a trade from clvand0, this beer was in an ordinary looking brown 12 oz. bottle.  Once the cap was popped the word ordinary left my vocabulary immediately.

Very thick and viscous with a dark brown body and little to no head to speak of, this was one robust looking drink.  The lack of head is understandable given the strength of the beer.

The aroma was roasty and vinous with chocolate, coffee, smoke, raisins, and roasted grains abounding.  The taste was mellow and smooth, with flavors of dark chocolate, creamed coffee, toffee, and raisins soaked in brandy.  With all the sweet and roasty flavors, the hop bitterness had taken a back seat.

Mouthfeel was thick and tongue numbingly rich.  The aftertaste was a bit peppery and alcoholic.

1019,"2004-11-09",4.4,"Pure black with a frothy hot chocolate head.  Sweetish nose - milk chocolate, caramel, some piney hop.  Absolutely beautiful creamy body.  Flavor is extremely sweet, rich chocolaty malt.  Mint, piney hops, milk.  Spicy alcohol finish.  A smoother & more complex Old Rasputin.  Id love to do a homebrew along the lines of this.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
1019,"2004-11-03",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2006 The aroma is very chocolaty with the darkest head Ive ever seen. It is very opaque black with a large rocky head. This beer was excitign to sip! Lots of malt with a nice bitter hop aftertaste. It was super creamy and got better as it warmed.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
1019,"2004-10-27",4.2,"Bottle.  Squeezed in between a Ruination and a Crustacean.  Kick butt, malty, earthy, bready, smoked, sweet aroma.  Thick, chewy brew, not much head (that should have tipped me off to the alc content), thin lace.  Will have to come back to this again.","Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania, USA","pobenohne"
1019,"2004-10-19",4.5,"I gotta be honest, my eyes are dim, my hearing is attenuated and my sense of smell is mostly gone.  I have been given every beer I rated a 5 in the aroma category so as not to give an advantage based on undetectable (for me) qualities.  Here I make an exception.  How else can I give a score that this beer deserves? It had a tight, dark head with staying power.  The hops balanced the burnt grain caramel sweetness to give a stong taste that was also smooth.  The mouth was left with hints of chocolate and coffee.  I drank it slowly to prolong the experience but will hurry out to obtain some more.","Verona, New York, USA","Grandpa"
1019,"2004-10-17",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2009 Bottle at the Pub. What can I say. Each day, Imperial Stouts grow more and more on me. After being tricked the first time, I asked for this beer and it was found. Like the holy grail, I was in awe. Well, maybe not. But I was very happy to see that compassed bottle brought my way. Kalamzoos bigger, more badass brother. The first thing I noticed when I poured the first 10oz into my glass was the wonderful and amazing aroma. It smelled like the kind of perfume that I would love on a girl. More on that in a minute as I indulge the appearance. Pours like used motor oil with no head, just oil slicks. Now, how does it smell you ask? Like a dream. Smells fruity from afar, like plums dipped in milk chocolate. Also smells like tropical fruits and flowers. Wow. This was the most amazing smelling beer Ive ever had. On initial taste, this beer was active as fuck. Amazingly complex, so much so that I was unable to pick out everything, but I tried. Burnt malts, malted milkshakes, some pepper. A little hairspray when it was still a bit too cold, but that went away. Tasted like it smelled in the first pass of the scent, like apples and plums. Anise presence is notable, as well as caramel and berries, and a bitterness that I associated with orange peel. Similarly, had a huge mouthfeel, like oil. Far thicker than Raspy, perhaps the heaviest beer Ive ever had...The mouthfeel was chewy like a chocolate chip cookie dipped in alcoholic coffee. Simply fantastic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1019,"2004-10-12",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2004 Bottle Pours a opaque black with  the darkest very think head I have ever seen.  Aroma is not so smokey but more hopy and notes of grass or wood.  Flavor is of bitter sweet choclate, charcoal and a little molassas.  The comercial description of ""5 times the hops"" of the kalamazoo stout is no lie. In fact I would say that this is the only specific attribute  that put me off from higher marks. The palate is unbeliveable though.  The butteriest slickest feel I've had to date.  Shared it with two beer buddies but non-RBers and we gasped and laughed as I poured our glasses.  Viscosity is just crazy and it sloshed in the glass like 10W-30.  This was my favorite part.
Thanks a ton to MrFacto for sending this, the highest rated beer I've had.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
1019,"2004-10-07",3.9,"2001 bottle: Poured thick viscous black with zero head...smelled of chocolate, butter, and phenols...tastes roasted malts, chocolate but predominately sweetness from alcohol...finish is all alcohol sweetness...aging definately brought the alcohol out in this one...great, but maybe 2 years is better than 3...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"

1019,"2004-10-04",4.1,"Velvety smooth with Barleywine-like character.  Subtle aroma is not as dominant as the pour would suggest.

Mega-Yum!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","sdcourtney"
1019,"2004-09-30",4.8,"Pours a jet-black, with a dark brown head, small at that. Aroma Is choclate, very similar to a gourmet hot-choclate drink! Alcohol and malt was also there.

1019,"2004-09-08",4.1,"Poured a deep brown almost black. The motor oil analogy someone had was not far off. No head. Aroma was mostly Mocha and dark chocolate/possibly like chocolate covered cherries after you bite it. Nice semi buttery mouthfeel. Flavor was Chocolate,coffee,a bit of roastyness with a slightly bitter finished.
I noticed no hops, Dark fruit,licorice or anything else that others have.
This bottle was about 9 mos old and served at 50- 55 degrees in a wine glass.","Lake Zurich, Illinois, USA","Metalhead"
1019,"2004-09-02",4.2,"Bottle. First and fore most the mouthfeel-awesome. Coats the whole mouth without being sticky. First flavors to come out are roasted malt, toffee, salt (yes, it is slightly salty), brown sugar, raisin, molasses, and caramel. Secondary flavors are butter, apple, and alcohol.

Palate is thickly coating yet slick and with a pleasing, tickling eff.  Flavors in accordance with aromas plus a trace of licorice, pitch, rum soaked fruitcake.

1019,"2004-08-28",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2009 Pour was definitely that of motor oil.  Jet black with no head.  The aroma was rich and complex.  This was not a beer for pounding.  I really picked a bad time to drink it.  Its an incredibly hot day outside and I already had a few in me.  The flavor just wasnt what I was looking for.  A sipping beer to be sure.  Huge thanks to Robertsreality for providing me with 3 bottles.  I will have to give this beer a better chance when I have more time to sit and enjoy it.8/3/4/5/14 
RERATE: 2003 bottle consumed February 2007. Three years old.  The top pops off silently... crap.  Probably gonna be flat.  Pour is solid black and oily.  No head at all as a result of depleted carbonation. Aroma is a beautiful mix of chocolate, liquorish, and coffee roast. This is way beyond what I remember. Flavor is the a delicate mix of the the same flavors hinted at in the aroma.  Body is slick and oily over the tongue.  It hardly even needs the carbonation to be considered great. Fantastic. 8/4/8/5/18 

ADD RATING: 12oz bottle from 2003 consumed in 2008, approx 5 years old. The pour is flat with no head. The aroma is amazing. Strong rich chocolate and mild roast. I cant wait to taste. The flavor has become more and more chocolaty. There is just a touch of alcohol but the flavor and body are right on. Great stuff even after several years. 8/3/8/4/18

12oz 2006 Bottle consumed in 2009. Silky black pour with a nose of chocolate and a touch of smooth roast. This beer is really tough to beat. The finish has just a touch of bitterness remaining.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"

Gonna drink this one reallly slow.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","crzybob77"
1019,"2004-08-27",4.3,"Poured with a dark cherry head that was short lived.  Disappeared completely after half a glass.  Looked like used motor oil, but the aroma was undeniabley that of an imperial stout.  Taste is complex laced with molasses, coffee, and smoke.  Nice bitter aftertaste which makes you come back for more.  Goes down real warm.  Very rich.  Highly recommended to Imperial Stout fans.","Frankfort, Illinois, USA","DrunkenLooser"
1019,"2004-08-26",4.5,"This is a huge beer.  Dark black. Small tan head.    Aroma is roasty with chocolate, coffee and dark fruit  that carries over to the flavor.  Thick chewy body.

1019,"2004-08-18",4.7,"pours an almost purple black with an orange tinted dark head. sweet strong earthy aroma of cocoa. flavor explodes with rich powerful chocolate and sweet caramel molasses, flavor melts into a bit of nitterness at the finish that helps reveal the alcohol bite that dries out your mouth a bit and leaves a powdery chocolate cookie taste,  i was dubious about this living up to the hype, but it has and i look forward to trying this in a year or so when my other bottle ages.","Montana, USA","Kevin"

1019,"2004-08-18",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2005 Bottle...thanks Jason!!. Poured as black as used motor oil and almost as thick. A small brown head formed (had to coax this one) and then diminished fairly quickly to a ring of bubbles around the edge that lasted to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is very complex; figs, chocolate, molasses, coffee and pine with a definite alcohol note.  This is a great example of the style. It starts out thick and sweet, then gives the taste buds a wonderful ride through the flavors like brown sugar, chocolate, cherries, pine, raisins  to an oddly pleasant bitter and astringent finish. The mouthfeel is amazing, thick - almost syrupy - with a light cream carbonation when rolled on the tongue.   Im buying more of this for the cellar.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"

1019,"2004-08-15",4.1,"This is a dark black beer with a medium dark tan head.  The aroma like the rest of this beer is quite complex.  It actually reminds me of a tawny port, with heavy notes of chocolate and alcolhol. Plus, a light blend of roasted coffee, licorice, and cassis.  Creamy and smooth in texture.  The chocolate and alcohol flavors dominate.  But, are accompanied by mild touches of licorice and a light to moderate roasted coffee bitterness in the finish.

1019,"2004-08-11",4.1,"I made the mistake of buying this thinking it was a regular stout. Not realizing the high ABV until too late, I fell fast asleep. I remember the intense aroma and flavor, chocolate, bitterness, and especially the rich, full mouth feel. Loving it, I got through 5 of them quickly  before I noticed my ABV mistake.

Strong alcohol taste and burn.","Lancaster, California, USA","Sven"
1019,"2004-08-09",4.3,"Pitch black..with a thin red head...uh-huh!  Aroma of a blend or Worcestershire sauce and Hersheys chocolate syrup.  The density is tremendous.  Taste is beyond description, but batter-licking good.  It is complex, rich, sweet, bitter.  Alcohol content buried in the ingredients.  Hard to argue the merits of this one.

All right, all you crazys. Finally I broke one of these puppys open. Was expecting what I found, and not what the ratings suggest. Deep deep brown, tan head. No light escapes. Aroma is a menage of chocolate, alcohol, and coffee, actually reminding me of an uncrushed bag of roasted barley, which is not really a bad thing. This will definately gain a point or two with age. Flavor is sharp and smooth at the same time, with alcohol and roast battling it out for supremacy. Very viscous mouth feel. Finish is a lingering coffee roasted bitterness. Hops blend with the roast and disappear.

Sweet chocolate, sherry, light cardboard aroma with tons of chocolate and mild-moderate roastiness.  Very quaffable.  Mildly transparent virutally black body with a very minute brown head.  Nice legging.  Starts with a little bit of chocolate roastiness and scant astringency.  Balanced with nice sweetness in the middle and fair roastiness later on.  Ethanol is hidden beautifully.

1019,"2004-06-05",4.1,"The word ""huge"" doesnt do justice to this beer. Its jet back with minimal carbonation. Powerful aromas of hops, licorice, rasins, alcohol, roasted malt, and terriaki sauce. It has a remarkable flavor evolution too, moving from hops, to dark fruit, to alcohol, and finally to the dark-roasted coffee, nut, and dark chocolate. Its also insanely heavy in the mouth.

After a few sips which opens up space for a more vigorous swirl in the glass, the alcohol is definitely more apparent in the nose, but not overbearing, and the roasted coffee notes also increase.  It pours completely black with what is a mostly insignificant brown head that slightly fizzes up upon the completion of the pour and quickly settles into a thin ring around the edges of the glass.  The minimal head leaves behind minimal lacing, but the beer itself leaves a nice coating on the sides of the glass.  The flavor starts with a big dose of chocolate and molasses.  Theres a nice sweet fruity presence in the background.  The finish has notes of black licorice, roasted coffee, and just a hint of smoke.  The alcohol isnt noticeable at all in the flavor.  Its full bodied with soft carbonation and a very creamy mouthfeel.  You really cant ask for a better mouthfeel in an Imperial Stout. 10-5-9-5-18","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1019,"2004-05-12",4.5,"Bottle. Motor oil black color, with only a faint tan head. Several different layers of aroma: earthy hops, chocolate, espresso, fruit, vanilla, whiskey, alcohol. This beer is thick and heavy. Roasted chocolate malt, and tons of it. Smokey, silky and smooth. Alcohol notes (hard to avoid with how much is in this). Lots of fruitiness as well, raisins I think. A punishingly complex brew. Dessert. Awesome.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"
1019,"2004-05-12",4.6,"Draught (and bottle). Wow...very sweet and complex. The usual Bells yeast has been hammered into submission (good) by the power of this imperial stout. Very well balanced as it has to be, almost barleywine-esque but not as apparently alcoholic.","Highland, Indiana, USA","BATLMULLET"

1019,"2004-05-09",4.4,"The alcohol is very well masked in this stout.  The label of 11.5% would make you think that this beer induce a nap, but that isnt the case.  Awesome scents roll off of the pour.  I have never had a pour produce ANY head though.  The dominant scents are those of soy sauce, fig, and raisins.  Yes, I said soy sauce... anyone I know that has tasted/smelled expedition stout immediately picked up on the soy sauce scent.  The taste of the actual beer is very strong, with an oily chocolate taste.  This is not a beginners beer though, its very hard to drink, and I personally couldnt drink more than 2 in a sitting.  It paired well with a red wine glass I had.","JAPAN","Erdrick"
1019,"2004-05-09",4.2,"A great stout indeed!  (~55 degrees, snifter).  A loose brown head quickly dissipates to a ring and some floating bubbles.  Lacing is minimal.  WHo cares?  Aroma is roasted malt and a bit of alcohol... a touch of chocolate as well.  Flavor has very little alcohol, suprising in a brew this big.  A great burnt/roasted malt flavor, espresso, bakers chocolate, and a touch of hops to keep things balanced.  Body is thinner than you would expect, but whatever.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety, with just enough carbonation.  Well done, a great stout!","Huntington Beach, California, USA","jonwell"
1019,"2004-05-08",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2004 Wow, this is a nice stout.  Looks good and taste good.  Does Bell?s make a bad beer?  So far, the answer is no.","MIlwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","TheDean"
1019,"2004-05-08",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2004 Chocolaty goodness, black as can be, smooth and oily, with a wonderful aroma, and I didnt even taste the 11.5% alcohol (bonus). OK, I noticed it, but not overpowering at all. This is a top-notch stout.","Michigan, USA","darkerdabetter"
1019,"2004-05-06",4.9,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 first off, i FINALLY got a snifter!! that being out of my system- this is the first beer i put into it.  i really like the presentation look that the snifter gives this beer.  pours like motor oil with a thin tan head.  smells of chocolate, coffee, and toffee. hoppy coffee flavor that is not much unlike speedway stout.  this is much more drinkable than speedway is however because it is not so thick.  great hoppy flavor that adds a very nice bitter aspect to the brew.  this is absolutely wonderful, and very worthy of a top 50.   this brewery has yet to disappoint me.  wonderful beer.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
1019,"2004-05-05",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2008 [bottle] Pours a pitch black with a thick and sticky brown head that does not go anywhere for quite a while. Deep and rich roasted malt aroma with a hint of molasses and a slight trace of alcohol. First taste absolutely blows you away. Wonderfully rich coffee and chocolate taste with a strong malt backbone and a strong bitter finish. Warms on the way down, but hides the ABV well. Thanks again MarkR.","Henrietta, New York, USA","zach8270"
1019,"2004-05-03",4.6,"cheers to zach diesel.  12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass:  no head, really.  slight swirling on the top, chocolate brown.  smell of alcohol, chocolate, coffeeeeeeeeeee.  mmmm, mmm, mmmmmmm.  MONSTEROUS!  huge.  genius. roasty burnt love.  tastes great. smooth dark chocolate decadence.  warms my belllllly.  touche.  one of the best beers ive tried.","santa cruz, California, USA","mardermax"
1019,"2004-04-30",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2005 Pitch black motor-oil when pouring, a mirror to any trace of light adventurous enough to try to get through. Superb chocolate brown 1-inch head, long-lasting and displaying awesome lacing, foamy, sticky like it came nitro-pushed. Very rich malt aroma, satisfyingly bittersweet with tons of molasses, dark belgian chocolate over home-made cookies, dark european bread, torrefied coffee with two creams. Subtle fruitiness (plums, blackberries), just as subtle complementing hops as I love them, piney and obvious hints of smoke. Very complex, but still not overly envelopping in the aroma department. In mouth though, this is a very intense experience, contemplative flavour development with the typical Bells milky aspect although theres almost no sweetness here. Just great smoked chocolate. Multi-dimensional spicy hoppy aftertaste, piney, bitter and very long. Carbonation was much more generous than I was lead to believe from other reviews, its just perfect here and I think Id have enjoyed it less or found it a bit less lively if it hadnt been for a little tongue-cleaning carbonation to entertain such a thick body. Holy Crap, totally dominant monument that I never expected to enjoy all that much and Ill admit liking some sweetness in my beers and not being a fan of hopfests. Once again, Raindog is the gentleman to be thanked and re-thanked.  Ive had this a few more times since the original rating and this remains my top imperial stout, does everything right for me. Complex, aging well, bold and superbly balanced. Transcendant world-class offering.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1019,"2004-04-23",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 28, 2004 Beautiful chcocolate brown.  Bittersweet.  Similar to Rogue stouts perhaps a touch better.  Unpasteurized.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
1019,"2004-04-16",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2007 From the bottle poured a dark brown head.  Aroma of chocolate and coffee.  Oily thick, cant see through the thing.  Great malt taste initially, a little alcohol in the middle and ending in mild hops.  Best Bells Ive had to date. 9/4/9/5/18 <P> Batch 6672 sampled Nov. 06.  Low escape of carbonation as the bottle is uncapped.  Pours a fairly viscous black color with a smallish brown head that fades somewhat quickly to a ring.  Decent lacing.  Aroma is lightly oxidized, still full of deeply roasted malt and dark chocolate.  Full bodied and coating.  Light cardboard notes blend well with roasted malts.  Alcohol is not very apparent.  Chocolate, still packs a nice hop bitterness for balance.  Damn this beer is rockin.<P> batch 7205 consumed March 07.  Black with a quick fading beige head.  Some lacing. Seemingly more malty than other editions.  More roasty, less apparent hop bitterness.  Slightly less hop flavor than other editions?  Deep roasted aroma, slight oxidation.  Pleasant, but seemingly lacking the hop punch in taste of earlier editions.  Tasty all the same, just a more malty, roasty imperial stout.  Quite enjoyable with an aged Acid cigar.","Alabama, USA","11026"
1019,"2004-04-15",4.5,"Nice, strong mocha aroma.  Pour like oil and a surprisingly large head in my snifter.  What a great beer.  I just had a Bell's Two Hearted IPA before this, and what a great follow-up.  Very creamy and smooth.  I can't tell that there is 11+% in this.  Rich, roasted mocha taste; caramel; sweet malts and relatively sweetish hops.  Wonderful.  One of the finest beers that I've ever tasted.","California, USA","tomxcs"
1019,"2004-04-15",4.6,"A winner in every sense.  Black as tar and nearly as thick.  Strong coffee aroma and flavours complement the tastable alcohol.  Its a big beer that deserves big respect.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KBeer"
1019,"2004-04-14",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2004 Pours black and strong.  I had one at noon and only later realized I didnt actually eat lunch.  The flavor is complex, changing slightly as you allow the beer to warm.  I fully recommend this beer.","Galesburg, Illinois, USA","civforprez"
1019,"2004-04-13",4.8,"#400! Yeah! I couldn't have picked a better beer either. I still refuse to give a 5.0. Pours opaque with a dark brown tight head with hints of burgundy. Lacing lasts through the entire beer and coats the entire bottom of a 30 oz. snifter. An aroma of rum-raisins (which I believe is essential for a great imperial), coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, oh yeah,... and alcohol. It has a flavor that is just as complex with hints of vanilla and a great hop bite at the end. The mouthfeel, while being incredibly thick, is far more enjoyable than that of the Dark Lord which is far thicker. The finish is nothing short of extraordinary with a lingering hoppiness on the back of the mouth. Nothing short of brilliant.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"
1019,"2004-04-09",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2006 Man, am I excited about this one!  I just poured it, and it is even darker than the cherry stout (which I described as ""blacker than the Ace of Spades"") with a gorgeous light brown head and great lacing.  The aroma is of malt, cabernet, licorice, and slightly perfumy.  My God, the taste and finish are pure heaven, super smooth, creamy, roasty, with final bursts of sweet maltiness, coffee, cabernet, licorice, and chocolate.  Fabulous stout.  The alcohol is definitely present, but it doesnt overwhelm the beer.  Exquisite.  I stack this one up there with Brooklyn Double Black, Weyerbacher Old Heathen and Raspberry Imperial, and Sam Smiths among the beers Ive had (and I still havent had the Dark Lord, Alesmith, Old Rasputin, Stone Imperial Stout, and Rogue Imperial Stout).","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
1019,"2004-04-07",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 10, 2004 Big thanks to kujo9 for this one. I want more - lots more. This is a phenomenal beer - oily black with no head and rich black-cherry edges. Roasty and sweet and plummy and somehow seeming to offer up both chocolate and vanilla. Very complex both in aroma and flavour. I think maybe some black licorice made an appearance too before a wonderfully astringent finish.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
1019,"2004-04-04",4.6,"I HORDE THIS BEER.  I easily have 2 cases stored away.  Pours with no head.  BLACK.  One of the most complex beers I've ever had.  Not for the faint-hearted.  A delightful way to enjoy is over a premium vanilla ice cream, much the same way one would have a rootbeer float.","Essexville, Michigan, USA","steve23mj"
1019,"2004-04-04",4.3,"So good.  Dark as night.  Smells of coffee and roasted malts.  The taste is wonderfuly complex.  Sweet chocolate, carmel, roasted, with a creamy feel.  There is a sharp bitterness but not one that overwealms the malt bill.  Great beer.","Zionsville, Indiana, USA","atpayne"
1019,"2004-04-01",3.4,"with thanks to Clarkvv - pours a dark black, motor oil like liquid, the fine black tainted head quickly reduces, coffee and black chocolate aroma with plumy and vanilla notes, toasty, incredible bitterness, very oily, the finish is very long, dry and deadly bitter with notes of cream and coffee - this is just too much of everything to be a great beer","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
1019,"2004-03-31",4.1,"Strong roasy, chocolate, coffee and alcohol smell. Same with flavor.  Wow, first Imperial anything.  No head.  Sticky as hell-you can tell theres tons of stuff in here. It's fun watching the bubbles struggle to make it through this brew.  Nice!","Los Angeles, California, USA","jollyraider"
1019,"2004-03-30",4.0,"Dark brown, green hue. Strong roasted malt nose, turning into something apple-ish; some phenol. Liquid liquorice, followed by a strong coffee and roasted malt wave. Strong, but too much unbalanced, to get a higher note. Thanks Philippe (Bov) for sharing this bottle.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
1019,"2004-03-28",3.7,"Aroma was an excellent mix of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts.   However, the beer poured thick, dark and flat.    Huge wall of flavor, was a bit tough after initial taste.   Could there be lactose flavor in this high alcohol imperial stout?","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
1019,"2004-03-25",3.8,"Black coloured. Mature aroma of prunes and raisins. Hops and coffee in the flavour. Full bodied. Bitter finish with a smoked touch.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"
1019,"2004-03-25",3.5,"A pitch black beer with a chocolate brown head. The aroma is a little sour, a little smoked, and a littel sweet. The flavor is fantastic; smoked, chocolate, coffee combined with a little sourness. It ends on a note of coffee. The sourness draws down in my overall rating of this beer - so that it is only good in my world.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1019,"2004-03-23",3.9,"12 oz bottle, snifter.  Coffee (dark), dark chocolate, roasted grain, molasses malt (H); oak, tawny port, vanilla, dust aromas.  Jet black body with a tall, tan, creamy head that is well lasting.  Moderately sweet flavor becomes a moderatley sweet, lightly bitter finish.  Seems underpowered somehow.  Medium-heavy body, oily texture, soft carbonation.  The bottom line is: Not quite as tasty as I found the Kalamazoo Stout to be.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
1019,"2004-03-22",4.2,"This is a great Imperial Stout. Pours Jet Black.  Malty, licorice, and dark fruit flavors.  Finishes smooth, creamy, and rich.","New Jersey, USA","beerslayer"
1019,"2004-03-22",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2007 It had a little, orange head. Has a rich coffee and toffee aroma with some ginger. There is also a hint of vanilla, very rich. Flavor is slightly sweet with a little alcohol kick. Coffee, toffee and deep roasted flavors are hiding in here. Some slight vanilla and mushrooms are also here.There was no lacing in my glass. Excellent all around. I have had this many times and I am impressed more each time. It has more balance than a lot of impy stouts. Because of the consistentcy of this great beer at various stages, I am bumping up my rating. This is THE definitive imperial stout.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

1019,"2004-03-20",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2007 So syrupy and rich that it sticks to the side of the glass like honey. Dark, malty and roasted with virtually no head. Pours like motor oil, but tastes great. So meaty that its not drinkable as a casual beer, but great once in a while.","Bells country, Michigan, USA","thetrifecta"
1019,"2004-03-18",3.4,"Dark and headless. Nose is alcohol, roasty, coffee. Flavour is anise and salty. Better than Batch 5000 but still not very drinkable.","Peoria, Illinois, USA","Alcoholist"
1019,"2004-03-16",4.7,"Pours oily black, black, midnight black. Head is dark tan and only an eighth of an inch thick.

Smells nutty, chocolately, sugary, and loads of it.

Definitely has nutty roasted malt flavors but also has strong sweet dark chocolate flavors present thoughout as well as some coffee.

Mouth feel is chewy, smooth, slick, chewy, outstanding.

ABV is somewhat masked at first but becomes more and more apparent as it goes down. That hurts the drinkability as does the sheer magnitude of this beer makes it too much to do a lot","Champaign, Illinois, USA","jables"
1019,"2004-03-15",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2006 Batch 6811 (5/26/05) enjoyed Sept 30 06 - Almost a year and a half in the bottle and this is a deeply complex bourbon hinted dream.  The standard of all all stouts.

2004 (Batch ~6100) Best batch Ive had so far. Palate is absolutely perfect- thick and oily. Sweet tobacco with very well placed hops. Alcohol is placed perfectly Worth a rating up-tick.

2003. This is a big all around stout.  Pours thick like thinned maple syrup. For the first few seconds after it is poured there is no head and then a short cocoa layer of foam rises to the top only to disappear into small pools of bubble.  First sip is roasty, licorice and THICK!  Then you feel the salty, bitter hops.  This tastes like European salty licorice.  Nose is like the waft you get when you pass a Starbucks.  Alcohol is initially hidden but then it feels very boozy.  The 2002 was too flat for me but may have had a better flavor- I still have some and will attempt a vertical.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
1019,"2004-03-13",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2004 Pours like texas tea. Black gold. Little dark brown head. Aroma is chocolate,malt and you can get a nice whif of the hops.  Taste is roasted malt then the alcohol hits you.  Very heavy on the tounge but smooth all the same.  This is a brew for sipping by the fire on a cold day.  Very tasty,complex and one of the best of its kind.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1019,"2004-03-11",4.5,"2002 batch. The color is a dark dark brown, bearing a similarity  to sweet crude, with little head. The aroma is wonderful and chocolaty.

1019,"2004-03-02",4.3,"Bottled.  Black as Ive ever scene with blood red hue. No head, just black goodness in the bottom of my glass. Absolutely powerful stuff, freakin incredible. Condensed stout aroma, power lot of malts, burnt, toasted, incinerated. Texture is like the thickest of Spanish or Italian coffees. Silky, cloying, persistent and generous.

1019,"2004-03-02",4.1,"Sampled February 2004
Pours a deep black color with a creamy brown head.  Thick aromas of chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, an aroma I usually associate with Lactose stouts, and alcohol all waft form my glass.  What a thick viscous brew, it is quite creamy on my tongue.  The thickness and body of this brew helps to balance the roast character, so that it is not overwhelming.  It is like a rich, creamy, chocolate covered espresso bean, but accentuated a bit more towards the creamy dark chocolate.  This beer has a burnt/ roast astringent finish, which, helps to balance the rich malty sweet flavors that are up front.  There is not much in the way of hops, but they would seem out of place in this brew.  The alcohol is well hidden in the taste, and is only really noticeable in the aroma.  Wow, what a wonderful, smooth, sipping beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1019,"2004-02-28",4.2,"Bad news is that this is my last Bell's that I got from FelonousMonk. Good news is, what a way to go out.

Poured pitch black with just a tiny bit of head even after a vigorous pour and what there was quicky went away, but there was a very nice lace down the glass.

Smells of chocolate, coffee, and < wheeze > alcohol. My sinuses are now very clean.

Tastes really good. My wife makes truffles by hand and I'm reminded of that rich, creamy chocolate she uses. Coffee is definately there. And wow, so is the alcohol.

Mouthfeel is great: full and creamy with a slight mineral feel. Drinkability is good, but really suffers because of the incredibly high alcohol content. I'll definately try more of these, but only at the end of the night.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"
1019,"2004-02-18",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2005 Intense.  Motor Oil black.  Absolutely NO carbonation.  THE richest, heaviest stout Ive ever encountered.  Flavors initially of alcohol heat,bitter chocolate, slight fig and soy sauce round it out.  The finish is a mixture of alcohol, bitter chocolate and hoppy bitterness.  So much to this that I cant do it justice with words.  You have to get one of these.  As a sidenote, I find this beer tends to be best with a few years of age on it.  I like them around 3-4 years old.  They really round out.","Reno, Nevada, USA","NVBeer232"
1019,"2004-02-17",4.2,"Bottle pours like fricken used motor oil, pitch black with very little head (brown).   Initial aroma is of some Soy Sauce as well as Coffee, Bittersweet Dark Chocolate, and something in the Fig/date family.   First taste reveals heavily roasted malt and a rich semisweet chocolate flavor.   After that settles, a hop bite greets you on the finish.   Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.   Very well balanced this is, not overly bitter, yet with some sweet attributes.   The 11.5% is masked very well.   Once it warms it develops a bitterness up front, in the back of the mouth, with a sweetness at the tip of the tongue.   Very interesting and tasty.   One of the better Imperial Stouts I have had.   Thanks goes out to ClarkVV for the trade!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

1019,"2004-02-07",4.9,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2005 1994 vintage 750mL bottle at bells 20th anniversary party. even after 11 years theres a little hiss on opening  and it oozes out of the bottle into a medium size snifter.  its an experience that defies notes on paper, and the promise of vintage bottles of this beer was the biggest impetus to be at the 20th anniversary party:  i was not disappointed (although i think it probably wasnt possible for me to be disappointed).  the aroma has stayed nearly the same throughout the years, perhaps its softened a bit.  the body...ohh, the body....is a creamy whirlpool of flavor and texture, with no diminishment of the roasted malt thats always been there, and some hops bitterness has ebbed into a balance that a tightrope walker would envy. any alcohol presence courses so perfectly through the body that if i didnt know it was over 11% i would have said it evaporated away, or that someone added corn starch to thicken it beyond belief.  if only i could have this again....
fresh, its just a bit raw, as the alcohol shines through more.  but lay it down for even just one season, and it mellows itself out.  to me, this beer is simply the definition of stout. i will drink this beer for the rest of my life, and i will be happy!  batch 6811 2005 version?  simply amazing, velvety mouthfeel and this beer never ceases to amaze me.  tons of hops, but those will eventually drown in the beautiful malt--just give it some time. 2002  pours like syrup, black as black.  no head to speak of, and not much carbonation (almost flat).  aroma is intensely malty and spicy, slightly alcoholic, a little raisiny.  extremely strong body--some burnt coffee, some chocolate syrup.  *eventually* finishes semi-sweet, with an alcohol tang.  this is a really exquisite, intense beer.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"

Long lasting head for such a strong beer. Flavor is again a mix of coffe, some fruity hops and a big malt backbone. I can image what it might be like in a year or two. I'd say I like it better than Strom King, but maybe not quite as much as Rasputin.","Glen Ellyn, Illinois, USA","HopasaurusRex"

Roasted and chocolate malt flavor with a ton of bittering hops in the back end. Lots of malt in this. Very thick. Bitterness is up front and lingering. Definitely a sipping beer with an alcohol warmth in your throat.

1019,"2004-01-21",4.9,"I've just poured my second bottle of Expedition tonight, both from the 2002 batch, and this one poured a fully opaque, thoroughly Stygian hue, with a full head, roasted, deep espresso brown, slowly settling down.
Aroma: bitter espresso notes first, then chocolate, dark spices, anise, pepper, then molasses, dark rum, until it's like a licorice whip and a chocolate bar all wrapped together and doused with cofee-flavored cognac, then set ablaze...
Taste: Mmmm! Great grit at first, fiercely bold bitterness, lush malt, and eternal finish. This is one stout that grabs hold of the palate from sip one, and never backs down, the flavor asserts itself initially and remains in every corner of the senses. Thick, slick, roasty feel pervades every inch of the brew and every second of your experience with it. At such high ABV, you'd refrain from over-consumption, yet the risk is less likely as the brew itself inspires long, luxuriant sips, and the flavor stays so surely on the palate that one can relax and subsist on the remaining lingering echoes that sit on the mouth. Even at the very end, I'm still detecting notes of charcoal and tar, and a dash of ash.
Imperial Stouts rank among my favorite styles, and this will always be up at the top.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

The nose was malty, some hop notes, roasted coffee, and chocolate. The flavor was that of coffee and chocolate with a lingering aftertaste. The mouthfeel was thick and smooth. I am not a coffee drinker so the coffee flavor in this beer was a little bit not to my liking. Overall, a good beer, but just too much coffee flavor for my taste.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
1019,"2004-01-12",4.0,"Super dark with a big, tan, soapy head.  Smells like chalky, dusty, alkali cocoa and some anise.  After the super-double-overroasted debacle of the Double Cream Stout, I'm a bit afraid to try my hand at this one.  *Tries a sip*  Very nice.  A dark, fruity, presence, there's gotta be some crystal malt in here somewhere, because the finish is clean without much hop-addled bitterness.  A bit watery, too.  Definite dusty cocoa the whole way through, as it warms, a bit of cherry comes through.  Pretty good as imperial stouts go, could have used a thicker mouthfeel and some more chocolately goodness, but perfectly passable.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"

The espresso shows more in the flavor for sure - in the form of a nibbling twinge at the back of the tongue.

1019,"2004-01-05",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2007 Dark, dangerous, glistening, slippery, ambrosial, aphrodesial.  Bottomless (unfortunately, this is a perception that is destined to be disproven).
Huge explosion of fresh and dried dark fruit in the aroma; cherries, plums, prunes, raisins, winey grapes...  Mocha roastiness and citric hops round out the nose.  Supernova of flavors, hugely complex.  Mocha, fruit, somewhat alcoholic like a full-bodied brandy.  Very savory flavors, like a rich demi glace.   Viscous body, the slight ticklish carbonation is perfect.  Sweetness is balanced by what must be a truckload of hops.  Finishes long and bittersweet.

The aroma strikes me as chocolate and coffee, more like some porters.  The taste is thick (I know, you shouldn't be able to 'taste' thick), chocolate, coffee, maybe a bit of leather like a good pinot noir.  A good medicinal taste as well.  Syrupy, but not overly so.

Very big, powerful, good, thick, etc. But it almost seems like when you add that up, you get something that needs more balance.

 Truthfully pours like a 10W-30 motor oil, a blank viscous pour of black liquid with amber highlights around the edges. Poured No head and No lacing at all, just a flat shadowy pool of oil and reflection. The aroma and flavor are rich with prune, plum, raisins, fig, deeply roasted barley and a hoppy bite in the finish. The mammoth ABV is apparent only in the nose, well also the brain, once you have consumed a good portion of it.       
 The mouth feel is soft and smooth, mostly due in fact to the total lack of full carbonation. The finish is bitter and roasty, kind of like licking a charred piece of oak.

Sweet, dark chocolate hits the tongue and then fades into a roasted malt and slightly bitter spicy, floral hop blanket that clings. Like eating a slice of hearty pumpernickel bread slathered with Nutella. Can't drink more than one of these in a sitting. It's a special occasion kind of brew.","Florida, USA","BeanDip"

A small brown head formed and then diminished fairly quickly to a ring of bubbles around the edge that lasted to the bottom of the glass (and I drank this rich SOB slowly).  Aroma is complex; figs, chocolate, molasses, coffee and pine with a definite alcohol note.  It tastes like an amazing mixture of everything mentioned in the aroma description along with grapefruit rinds and quince extract.  It starts out thick and sweet, then gives the taste buds a rollicking ride through the flavors to an oddly pleasant bitter and astringent finish.

After some time, the bitterness betrays itself, linking to the herbal aromas: a megadose of hops; piney notes, the peels of walnut, chicory. And all the time, the chocolate sauce is screaming to get your attention. Viscous liquid, seeming to go solid any minute. Pure body (on alcohol).

The mouthfeel is slick and almost syrupy, the lack of carbonation having a somewhat negative effect.  Flavor is dominated by roasted malts, espresso, chocolate, brandy, and spruce.

I want to love it like I used to, but I just dont think I can.  There are too many other imperials I enjoy greatly without having to work at it.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"
1019,"2003-09-09",4.9,"This beer is so dark you cant even see light through it at all. The head was a wonderful caramel color which didn't last very long. Smells sweet and chocolatey, like a great oatmeal cookie. The flavor is very intense. Also tastes strong espresso with a bit of chocolate. This does have a great bitter finish. You can taste the alcohol but the flavor is so intense without it even being there. I can't imagine drinking more than one of these at a sitting. This makes Kalamazoo Stout taste like water.

Loads of liquorice, roastyness and a heavy bitterness in the flavour. The bitterness get a little to much in the end. To me flavours aren't 100% balanced. The liquorice lingers for quite a long time on the palate, which is pleasant. A great brew, thats maybe a bit too much for me. Many thanks to Raindog for this beer.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"

1019,"2003-08-15",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2006 Jet black, opaque. A batch from 2003 was as flat as Lubbock, Texas, but later batches have produced a nice creamy head. Aroma of licorice, soy sauce, alcohol, chocolate, black coffee, and mellow hops. Ultra-thick and full bodied, this beer is jam packed with flavors of figs, coffee, chocolate, licorice, raisins, plums, berries, soy sauce, tobacco, smoke, port, nuts, molasses, hops, and ethanol. Evokes memories of the three-course meal gum from Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory that turned Violet into a giant blueberry. The aftertaste is rich and indulgent. Lack of carbonation, depending on the batch, and ultra-complex flavor make this brew a fantastic, slow, port-like sipper. 

Re-rate, 1/16/04. An 8 inch fall managed to produce a loose tan head the size of my pinky, showing me that the 2003 is indeed carbonated. At least this bottle was.  I bumped the appearance up one point.  The only additional comment worth adding is that this stuff is UNBELIEVABLE with dark chocolate.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
1019,"2003-08-12",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2007 2002 bottled.  Black, with deep, dark violet tinges around the edge. Head is almost nonexistant from this bottle, and there is plenty of burnt white colored lacing.  Aroma is incredible.  Strong, alcohol and malt with some rich maple smoked malt and some dark fruit aroma.This beer opens up with huge malt flavor that is fairly sweet, somewhat oily texture, and full of alcohol and malt.  There is plenty of brown sugar appeal, along with some smokey almost sweet maple sausage flavor.  Has a nutty taste that becomes a little more apparent and a mild bitter quality comes out as the body progresses. Slowly a nice dry/woody hops flavor appears and inserts its flavor smoothly.  Flavor is still bursting with ripe dark fruit and in the finish there is a woody hops appeal that is just apparent enough to balance out the malt.  Has a wonderful balance of hops and malt.  The best Ive seen in an Imperial yet. This beer gives it all.  Hops, roast, chocolate/coffee malt, dark fruit, alcohol, woody smoke flavor, some bitterness. . .and plenty more. Extra Full Body, perfect carbonation (almost none). After trying this, I had to order another. Incredible complexity, so many flavors to pick out.  This beer will keep producing new sensations every time you try it.  This would be incredible aged, as well.  If this beer was more affordable, or I had more money, I would be drinking it daily.  Rerate.  Sure, this beer has some acidic moments and alot of hops bitterness, but again, huge flavors, rich complexity and potential for extended aging, comes at a price.  If you cant handle the high ABV, bitterness and some acidic notes, drink a different style of beer.2003 Bottle. Oh wow.  This is so young its ridiculous. Can hardly finish, too sweet yet, bitter hops are overpowering.  This will age NICELY!!!  2003 bottle aged 13 months  A bottle from an early November 2003 batch consumed 12/26/04.  This stuff ages perfectly.  The hops die off and you just have beatiful malt, a full body, thick chewy chocolate and roast.  I cant get enough ot it.2004 bottle  Still pretty close to perfect.  Hops mellow out wonderfully after a year.  Tried side by side with the batch 7000 and the malt structure is fairly similar, albeit a little less brash and having less ""Spanish coffee"" influences, for lack of a better term.  Thick, rich malt, but yet balanced and supremely thick, rewarding texture.2005 bottle, batch 7205  Pretty thick and chewy, obviously, and actually I ended up liking the aroma more than the flavor.  Too much soy/oxidized dark malt on the finish of the flavor.  The nose had a beautiful, but now faded, hop nose, very fruity and wintergreen/resin-like.  Prunes, black chocolate and plenty of drawn out vinousness with a big backing of roast.  I havent been floored by any of the 2005 or 2006 batches.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1019,"2003-08-05",4.2,"A damn fine beer that took two weeks and a six pack to get a good handle on. So there. Where do I begin? Pitch black, of course, like motor oil, etc. You couldn't get this sucker to pour with a head if you tried; just a few dark brown bubbles. This beer reminds me SO much of Owd Mac's it isn't funny--only Owd Mac's is a little bit richer and fruitier. Peaches, maple syrup, apricots, malt, malt, malt, rye, grain hulls, lots of sweetness. Flavor is more interesting: Very sweet, but a little bit of acidic fruit juice, roasted coffee, dark chocolate, a little smoke, medium-quality cigars, a little bit of pine cones. Just a big smoking campfire of sugar and various fruits. I will concur with the others on the near-miraculous body of this beer. It is absolutely the thickest beer I've had to this point, although surely this is accentuated by the near-lack of carbonation. Overall a definite winner, maybe a classic, and I'm laying some down for the winter.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

The beer pours with a dark, black appearance - no clarity whatsoever with a nice, almost syrupy pour.  The aroma is very rich - black licorice, coffee, chocolate.  The flavoring is magnificent - and only gets better as it gets warmer.  The taste is of coffee and sweetness.  A slight hint of alcohol is masked well in this stout.

I like the fact that this version doesnt have the ""oily"" alcohol overtone, but at the same time it seems a little dumbed down.Re-rate 12/4/03Tick rocky light brown head, pretty good retention.  Warm piney aroma, somewhat reminds me of a pig (musky straw overtones).   Big hoppy flavor backed up by a chewy, gelatinous malt.  Lots of flavors here, sweet chocolate, bitter coffee, ripe fruit, bitter hops - it all comes together to form a kickass brew!  Piney bitter aftertaste, and a creamy-smooth sensation sticks around too.  My only detraction bases around an excessive alcohol taste - theres this vodka-y oiliness that presides over the flavor spectrum.  Not sure if I like that...

1019,"2003-06-24",4.9,"This stout is deep brownish-black, and absolutly thicker then all hell. You cannot see throught it at all. Put it up to the light, nothing? Its like motor oil. I must have a brand new batch, cuz the super dark tan head grew fast up the edge of the glass. One of the darkest heads I've ever seen, very dark tan much like the color of a caramel candy, and it was a nice frothy head with some bigger bubbles on the opposite side from which I poured it. Some large patches of tight tan lace cling forever. Eventually the head shrunk down leaving a nice settled coat of caramel colored head just on top. I can't quite place the overwhelming aroma, I think its a liquorish or something, maybe saffron? Very puzzling, but man it is nice. Has an extremely fresh quality, very lightly hinted dark roasted barley and coffee. Seems to be complex, but I can't seem to pin point what that smell is. It reminds me kind of like a cough syrup or something. Taste is damn good, super smooth and silky, nicely coats and has a bit of sweet bitterness in the finish. Heavily roasted barley malt with some coffee and chocolate in there. I don't know what it is about that smell, because it transfers over to the taste a little and is super good and interesting. I'm going to do some kitchen research and try to find that smell. The feel is perfect for a stout, very smooth, rich, silky, bold, and heavy and has that wierd little sweet twinge in the finish and leaves your tongue with a bit of bitterness on it. This an amazing stout and is very soothing to drink. That powerful 10% is hardly noticeable in the smell or taste, but its there. It sinks in about 3/4 of the way through.

Very dark-- a little chocolatey, very roasty, very oily, and very pungent.  Like squid ink or a Bic pen exploding in your mouth.  Very bitter and very long finish.

Oily, dark chocolate with slightly raisiny aroma.  Motor oil brown-- almost black.  Incredibly long finish of dark ringing malt, bitter hops, and coffee.  But the big change for me is the new balance it seems to have with the stronger bittersweet chocolate flavor up front than I remembered.

1019,"2003-04-27",3.1,"With thanks to Inveglier. I had this with a Good King Henry Imperial Stout and a Harvey's Imperial Extra Double Stout. There was much they all had in common, but this was the one with the fullest mouthfeel, the least carbonation, the least sweetness, the least complexity, the most bitterness and the most chocolate. The initial fruit juice flavour is swiftly overcome by the bitterness, but it can be teased out as a red fruit of some sort. There is also some orange peel and some nutmeg in the finish. The aftertaste is a lingering pleasure, and is the best aspect of this otherwise overpoweringly single-minded brew. When comparing the nose with something of the complexity and wonder of Harvey's classic this just doesn't match up, however it does produce some delightful chocolate, plums and licorice. A very tasty brew, but the huge unbalanced bitterness and thick as two short planks mouthfeel mark this down for me.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

Whenever I burn out on imperial stout, I come back to this one and it reminds me why they are so damn lovable. Its just intense in all respects. Very hoppy and very thick. Its as much barleywine as it is stout and always a treat.

Original rating: Dark and oily. Nearly black. No head but thats not really problematical for a beer of such high gravity. Aroma of strong coffee, dried fruits, and a touch of alcohol. Thick rich palate. Seriously. This is a meal in a bottle. Damn... More coffee, plumbs, raisins, molasses, and chocolate. Slightly acidic. Very slightly bitter. Alcohol is present but it works well with the other flavors. Beautiful.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

I got Oak, alcohol, cherries, chocolate, brownies, caramel, black currants and roasted malt...for starters. The taste is the strongest thickest baked on malt i have ever laid my taste buds upon. Holy brownie batman thats thick! Chocolate malts, nugget, snickers bar, cherries, sweet sugars, bittering hops, grainy chocolate, and heavy alcohol dryness just grip the mouth and seep every last ounce of sanity out of the tongue. Very dry, grainy malts, super full of flavors.

1019,"2003-02-01",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2005 Wow.  I found a beer that may rival Double Cream Stout (what a coincidence, its from the same brewery!).  This one is powerful.  Expedition Stout is genetically modified and fed the appropriate mix of steroids and hormones to create a rich, robust, sweet flavor in a gravy-like pour.  When Ben Franklin made his famous comment about God showing his love to humans by providing them beer, it is this beer he had in mind (thus, he was also an oracle).  A must-buy, even at the steep price.  Of course, you dont want to drink more than one or two of these at a time!  This must be the stout syrup that other stout-makers use to dilute their respective products.  Unbelievable!  Warning: this one has little to no head whatsoever.  It is so thick that what little carbonation is present surely is prevented from escaping!
1994 Vintage sampled at Bells 20th Anniversary Party.  Imagine my delight when a nice list of vintage beers was placed on the bartop at Bells during their Anniversary Party.  Unfortunately, none of these 750 mL bottles were allowed off premises!  So, I ordered up the 1994 vintage of my top-rated beer and filled up.  The years have been kind to this beer.  The classic opaque dark brown/black body, light tan head, lacing, ahh...it all looked so familiar.  The aroma was rich and dominated by molasses and prune.  Layers and layers of molasses, toast, prune, coffee, raisin, licorice, and roasted malts coated my palate.  Rich and full-bodied, and only showing slight hints of oxidation after 11 years.Rating for 1994 vintage: ARO: 8 APP: 5 FLAV: 9 PAL: 5 OV: 17 (4.4 overall).","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Aroma is a dark and foreboding roasty smell with some black coffee and dark chocolate. The aroma really did not prepare me for how strong this beer is. Somehow the smell does not warn you of the sinister alcohol content that waits to pounce on you the second you take your first sip. Flavors of alcohol, coffee, roasted malt and burnt wood.

1019,"2002-12-27",4.1,"Sucked the light out of the room while I poured it.  Has a lot of different tones to it which combines to yield a very good, complex stout.  Slightly smokey, roasted, sweet, maybe a touch of chocolate, but none of them dominate any other.

1019,"2002-12-25",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2007 So thick, syrupy, oil-like consistency, and sticky.  Lots of flavors, but not bursting with any one dimension.  Not so much chocolate to me as much as roasted tones, coffee, and alcohol.  My 500th beer rated: I would like to begin by thanking all of my friends and family who have supported me over the past ten months.... // I just shared a bottle with Jazz88 in order to celebrate his impending marriage.  It was a bottle that he gave to me in the Spring of 2002, so (drinking it in April 2007) it was at least 5 years old.  It was tremendous.  It didnt taste oxidized or ""aged"" much at all, just mellow, so smooth, so rich.  This truly is one of the best nectars ever made.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

1019,"2002-12-21",4.4,"Poured slowly from the bottle, more like hot 10w-40 than beer.  The color was black as night, with no change when held to light.  Aroma of burnt chocolate and coffee, which was the taste as well.  I had on my tongue the bitter coffee taste for an hour after drinking.  I dont care for stouts, but I definately appreciate this beer within the style.  It was very well balanced, and the abv was well masked with the flavor.  This beer does well to warm you on a cold winter night (25 degrees here tonight) and I would recommend this beer highly to any stout lover.","Dowling, Michigan, USA","hvac4sl"

<P>It didnt matter how hard I poured the beer, there was no head gonna form. This is an intensely black beer that sucks the light from the surrounding aread giving it a sort of dark halo. Light cant even pass through the edges. When you pour, you immediately pick up chocolately, coffeeish aromas before you even lean in for a sniff. Upon closer inspection a bit of caramel can be picked up. The flavor is very similiar to the smell except that it explodes on your tongue and can be overwhelming at first. Huge. It leaves the same aftertaste as dark coffee with cream. The mouthfeel is very creamy and chewy. I very rich, dessert-like beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1019,"2002-11-18",4.0,"The bottle opened with a slight whoosh.  There was minimal carbonation, with the only trace of a head around the edge of the glass throughout the drink in the form of a few bubbles and a line of foam.  The aroma was coffee and licorice.  The palate was thick and creamy with the combo coffee, licorice, and chocolate flavor.  I liked it a lot, and it went down smooth, even with a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste.  I would only  be able to drink one of these in an evening and not get overwhelmed by the taste and alcohol.

1019,"2002-11-13",4.6,"Re rate 11/13/12. Even better than I remember it. The nose is a complex blend of dark fruit, brandy, chocolate, and coffee. The flavor is an intense blend of that combination that starts silky smooth and finishes with just a bit of an alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is 
amazing it just slips, slides and rolls around your mouth. I need a case of this ASAP!Wow!!! This has it all. A deep, deep black color with a nice brown head that sticks to the glass. An amazing malty, chocolate aroma. The flavors are HUGE. Chocolate, coffee, licorice, maybe even a cheesecake like sweetness right before the hops lead to a dry finish. Just an amazing beer!!!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"
1019,"2002-11-12",4.8,"Vintage 1999:  Dark brown stout with no head at all.  Aroma is intense: oily, coffee grinds, touch of hops, plenty of roast and a solid amount of dark chocolate rounded off by notes of dark fruit.  Body is very smooth, almost barleywineish.  Alcohol is prevalent on the tongue, and so it should be, this is at least 11.5% ABV.  Intense roasty notes complimented by coffee, dark fruit and chocolate.  Ends bitter, with just a touch of hops.  Man, this stout has it all; balance, intensity and is a stellar example of this fine style. Defeats Nils Oscar as my new favorite imperial stout.  Absolutely incredible, the only negative aspect is that Ill probly never have this vintage again.  The memory will have to suffice....","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"

1019,"2002-10-28",4.8,"Black as midnight on a new moon with a small, brown head containing large bubbles and dissipating fairly quickly.  Aroma virtually lept out of the glass as it sat on the counter warming prior to my initial sip.  I could smell this beer from 5 feet away while watching the news and waiting for it to warm, all the while my mouth watering and my hands involuntarily reaching for the glass.  Aromas are prunes, raisins, plums, and earthy hops.  Initial sip shows all of the above dark fruits evident and fading brilliantly into a pronounced hop bitterness that builds to eventually overcome the molassas and fading dark fruits as the aftertaste slips away.  This is a very thick, vinous beer that completely avoids becoming cloying despite seeming to have tiny black granules floating on the head.  Absolutely NO alcohol presence outside of the warming feeling as it slides down your throat - no hot alcohol aromas or flavors to be found anywhere.  This is just absolutely magnificent, and it is more that worthy of its position on RateBeer and its status as my new top rated brew.  I owe many thanks to proc for sending this my way.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

This is so deserving of its ranking in the top 50.Underrated I think.A little sweetness at the front creamy malty cut by the perfect hop bitterness at the end.

1019,"2002-10-23",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2015 Bottle (Sep 11, 2015 bottling [yikes!!]). Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is opaque black (flashlight tested), bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (dark chocolate, caramel, roasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers, apricot), with notes of vanilla, unripe banana peel, and alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly bitter, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/velvety texture, soft carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic. 
The aroma is clean and pleasant, but not really that exciting. Every batch is a little different though. Good flavor balance...rich but not fatiguing. Fairly burning alcohol but not too obnoxious. Still very solid but maybe not quite 4+ territory this time.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

I am partial towards Bells also... but enough. Not bad at all... nuttier than the other ones I have tried, it has the molasses, roasty aroma and flavor... and damn, coffee overload... malty as hell and yet, retains some nice hoppiness. Dry finish that rocks and stays with you for a while... not as flavorful as the dogfish head, a bit better than the old rasputin... but still a great imperial stout.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","slinkymello"
1019,"2002-10-11",4.2,"I have to say that I was really looking forward to trying this beer.  Maybe I got my hopes up, because I couldnt help but feel a little let down.  Smelled great. It wasnt nearly as thick as I hoped it would be and the flavors, while rich and chocolately and spicy, were submerged in a strong alcohol tang.  I was hoping for the perfect stout.  This wasnt it.  But it was pretty close.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","mjmurphy2"
1019,"2002-10-08",4.3,"So I completely inverted the bottle, and I got just a pinch of head to rise up, but thirty seconds later theres just a rim of foam left.  Zero carbonation.  Luscious malt aroma:  bittersweet bakers chocolate, molasses, caramelized sugar, slight vinous notes.  This is very sweet, but not over-the-top sweet.  Reminds me a little of brownie batter.  Delicate hop levels counteract the malt fairly well, and add a touch of astringency.  Silky texture, and still it coats the mouth like cough syrup.  Not quite perfect, maybe a hair off balance, and yet a  stellar brew.  Man, these imperials are fun, arent they?","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"

1019,"2002-09-25",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2008 Batch #8295 sampled on 4/1/08: Typical appearance.  Aroma seems a little drier and toastier than I remember, but still has very nice dark fruity complexity and roasty malts.  Body is thick and full as always and has good dark caramel and chocolate sweetness before a more bittersweet, roasty warming finish.  This may be one of the freshest Expeditions Ive tried, but its still great and should age well.

Batch #6672 sampled on 8/24/07: Same viscous oily opaque appearance as always with a thinner, wispy-lacing light brown head.  Aroma of sweet oatmeal and dark caramel with some plums and mild smoke.  Body starts very dense, but with a nice, not cloying sweet maltiness and good dark chocolate notes throughout.  Complex dark fruits and plenty of malt hide the alcohol very well and make this incredibly drinkable.  An amazingly affordable, available, and enjoyable imperial stout!

2002 batch sampled on 4/4/06: Pours very dark and viscous with a nice, large, dark tan head.  Aroma of sweet dark fruits, toasted caramel malts, and lots of dark chocolate.  Body is still very full and has plenty of carbonation, but seems to have dried out some, leaving more of a lingering roasted, almost smoky finish.  Very enjoyable as always.

2004 batch sampled on 10/11/05: Just a dense, sweet viscous well of dark fruit, brown sugar, mild soy and malty complexity.  This is just simply a great imperial stout.

2003 sampled on 1/23/04: Pours the same rich oily black I remember.  Very nice complex fruity and sugar cookie aroma.  Body is full of molasses and thick sweet caramel malt.  Very nice hop balance is also present.  The roasted malts dont show up until late in the finish, but they linger quite long.  This is an excellent imperial stout.  This gets the same rating as the 2002 version.

2002 sampled on 9/25/02: Black, covered with a smooth tan head.  Lots of soy and floral hop aroma.  Very syrupy, but elegant and smooth at the same time.  Hops taste very fresh and the body is full of surprises; chocolate, soy sauce, and molasses.  The best thing I have tried from Bells thus far.  If I were going on some sort of expedition, I would not leave home without a six-pack.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

One of the darkest, creamiest heads Ive ever seen:  chocolate mousse.  Strong nose of roasted grains, chocolate and wine.  Flavor is bitter chocolate, scotch, and butter (yes, butter); velvety smooth on the tongue, with perhaps just a tiny bit too much alcohol presence, nonetheless a great great Imperial and deserving of its high praise hereabouts. 8/5/9/5/19 4.6 
December 2005:  2x12 oz bottles (2001)shared with  MartinT, tiggmtl, Rastacouere, beerbuzzmontreal and Yowie.

December 2005: 2x12 oz bottles (Apr 2005 bottling) shared with the same group above.  The fresher bottle is much smokier and rougher in the nose, the flavors dont gel as well on the tongue, and the mouthfeel is a bit gritty.

Nutty, deep chocolate malt and Bells yeast aroma that combines with the vanilla ice cream and musty bitterness, perfectly.  The sharp, fresh bitterness has dulled into a buttery, charcoal and truffle chocolate elegance.  The alcohol sneaks up on me, as usual, but adds a layer and dimension to this beer that pulls me deeper.  The palate is beyond thick, but has a creamy and soft texture anyway.

I have not experinced it since, and this beer is amazing.  All the flavor comments below still apply, and its better with some bubbles in it.
(8-29-02 4.1)  I must have got one with no head.  I tried to create a head with the pour, but my beer just seemed under-carbonated.  I put another in the fridge tonight and will see if it is as flat.  (You really don't want to drink two of these in one night if you have to go to work in the morning.)  It pours out of the bottle like motor oil and it simply will not let light pass through it.  I did get a couple little bubbles fighting to the top, but they couldn't keep it together enough to be called a head or lace.  The nose was of deep roasty malts with a carmelized sugar/alcohol overlay.  Very complex sweetness with roast coffee, dark chocolate, molasses and burnt caramel all hiding among the flavors.  This beer is butter smooth and coats the mouth with a nicely balanced bitter/sweet finish.  An excellent sipping beer for when the nights get colder and I hope my other bottles are even better.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

This is a beer that takes a good long time to finish and thats how it should be because its a perfect nightcap beer.  It leaves a nice bittersweet aftertase as well.

1019,"2002-07-15",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2003 So, we meet at last...the infamous Expedition Stout.  Pours a deep, rich black-brown with a very thick light brown head.  Sedimentation is noticeable, even in a beer as dark as this.  Bottle swirled.  Aroma is stout in and of itself, giving off an almost palpable malt aura.  Smells like semi-sweet chocolate and a roasty double espresso.  Incredibly thick, almost burnt maltiness dominates the majority of the flavor profile, with some pine/spice hop flavor, and alcohol adds a nice little kick to the finish, along with a bit of yeast and a nice malty fruitiness.  Mouthfeel is unlike any beer I've yet tried, like a melted hot fudge sundae, or heavy cream.  Full-bodied is so much understatement as to be laughable.  Intense and unique beer.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1019,"2002-07-14",4.1,"one of the best stouts ive had in a long time. Starts very crisp, almost metallic.

1019,"2002-07-13",5.0,"Ok, let me take a deep breath and calm down.  This beer pours blacker than night with a head equally, if not more beautiful than A. Le Coq.  The nose is so thick and sweet I cant stand it anymore, I must taste this!  I think I just came.  Thick as melted chocolate.  Great smoky taste and complex malt/hop combo.  This beer leaves me with a feeling that someone out there really does care.  damn this is good shit!","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
1019,"2002-07-13",4.6,"#100! Woohoo!  I was hoping to have something special on hand for my 100th rated beer, and this lives up to the task.  My goodness, this is such an extraordinary beer, that it would prompt a novice to wonder whether this is a beer and not some other kind of drink, like wine.  What does this beer afford for the beer-lover?  For starters . . . get a whiff from concentrate out of the bottle before pouring, and youre peppered with an array of scents.  Ive asked a few friends to help identify what is contained therein, and heres what we come up with, aside from the coffee/chocolate-type character associated with an Imperial Stout: licorice, cherry, raspberry, raisin, red wine.  Warning: the fumes come in pretty heavily from the alcohol, too.  In the appearance, you get an expected near-black-to-black of a stout, with a creamy head thats unassailable.  When you finally take a sip after a couple minutes of savoring the aroma, you get a mouth-texture thats like pure silk streaming from Cindy Crawfords ass.  The drinkability is much like a wine, with an alcohol bite in the throat . . . but its still remarkably smooth, soft and silky.  It is, however, really overpowering alcohol-wise, and as such, its drinkability is limited to occasional use, and preferably when you can split a bottle with a beer-appreciating friend.  It goes down much easier and better that way, I think.  First-rate stuff.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

Everything about this beer has depth.  It coats the mouth and throat (syrupy palate) and lasts forever.  The aroma is oddly fruity, but the flavor seems to be all dark coffee, chocolate, roated, burnt, molasses, and a long sweet finish.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"

1019,"2002-06-11",4.5,"Pours with a tiny head (if you try to get one, that is).  Black color, huge coffee/burnt/chocolate nose.  The taste drags you in many directions at the same time.

1019,"2002-06-07",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2004 Rerate: with a year of aging and repeated exposure, I see this is a terrific imperial; good sweetness, good hop acidity, measured saltiness. Yum. Original: June 7, 2002: Somewhat less than the sum of the parts, somehow, I don't know. Yes, the hops grab you, but because this brew is *so* full-bodied, they don't grab you by the throat and throw you down like in Stone's imperial, IMO. Oh, man, but the heavy maltedness in this thing; not just roasted, not just bitter, not just toasted, not just chocolaty...but something I can't identify, that arose immediately upon warming (but not before)and won't go away. Aha! It's almost like a nuttiness to the aroma. I've seen 'vinous' used on this site alot...this beer seems to define the usage. Strong. Wonderful. So insanely full-bodied it loses some drinkability.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1019,"2002-06-04",4.8,"Excellent imperial stout.  If there was a darker beer, you would need Steven Hawking and a radio telescope to find it.  This is the beer to drink in wing-backed leather chair while your fireplace crackles with flame.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"

1019,"2002-05-23",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 27, 2004 alcoholic and overflowing with exotic aromas of fig, raison, grass, cocoa, vanilla, and more! This beer has the strange effect of turning the vessel murky, clear brown. Magic on the lips, first kissed with sweetness and powdered sugars, then immediately to coffees and dry cocoas, thick chewy malt and a shot of raisony alcohol at the finish. Bitterness comes through at the finish,as well. Recently tasted an 8 year old sample with mind blowing complexity and richness. All vinatges that I have tried (96, 98-03) have been exceptional and better with age. Barrel conditioned versions have proven to be the best beers I have tasted. Perfectly suitable for topping a dessert. I have experimented with Expedition Stout in mixtures, as well. Try 2/3 Expedition and 1/3 Lindemans Frambois for a tasty dessert drink or 1/3 Expedition Stout, 2/3 New Glarus Belgian Red for an awesome surprise!","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
1019,"2002-05-06",4.2,"Syrupy, opaque blackness entices. Sweet, chocolatey aroma sent the hook down my throat further. Super heavy mouthfeel; my tongue felt like it was getting a workout. Soft, smooth, and sweet up front... slowly metamorphosizes into a tangy, rich bitterness that causes your teeth to clench... then alcohol notes exude like an overflowing claw-foot bathtub. This is followed by a wave of flavor, aroma, and alcohol, which plow through your nose and mouth like a bulldozer, driven by a drunk maniac on PCP. This may sound bad, but I liked all these things. And I liked its roasty burntness, subtle vanilla sweetness, rich coffee, and dark chocolate flavors. The alcohol does jockey for attention quite a bit, but I didnt mind it; it kept the beer from becoming too cloying. And who doesnt like a little alcohol now and then? Nothing less than wonderful.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

I tried it, too cold, in a 12 oz. pint style glass - too sweet, too weird. Tried it again, used  a Rodenbach stemmed glass, just below room temperature. It was much better, less oily, aroma earthy, chocolatey, but not terribly complex. Sweetness was more integrated into the overall taste - a nice combination of sweet/bitter hits you simultaneously. Very rich. I havent smoked in 20 years, but this seems like it would be great w. a cigar. Rich, resiny, coffee, chocolate, raisins - what is this world coming to? Ultimately, very nice, but it took a while.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"

The aroma of bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans, sweet malt, and black strap molasses, what a treat to sniff this magnificent beer. Start is cotton candy sweet, the malt thick and heavy upon the palate, the top thick as a piece of chocolate fudge, the finish delicately carbonated, the hops spiteful in their spicy bite, the alcohol quite evident in the bitter dry aftertaste. 'Excellent', not meant for the weak of palate, as this is as robust as Stouts get a real 'Stout Lovers' dream, WOW!

The appearance  was a deep, dark, opaque ebony.  My sample was totally decapitated (read: absolutely no head) so this totally dropped what would have been an otherwise perfect appearance score.     (Is this normal?)   The taste was malty, sweet and at the same time roasted, charred.   The high alcohol was noticeable in the warming  effect  more so then the flavor.   Palate was wonderful and would have been perfect was just a wee bit of carbonation.  (Once again there was no carbonation at all!).
