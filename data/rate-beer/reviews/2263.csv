2263,"2017-03-18",2.1,"I was really looking forward to a great taste experience when I opened this bottle. Right from the start I realized that I was to be disappointed. The aroma was more solvent than anything else. Flavor had some dark malt roastiness but was overwhelmed by a stressed yeast phenolic that really thinned out the palate of this BSA.

Bubbles are small but not such to make it seem creamy. Taste is dough and yeast frosted with dark fruits - almost like a dark sticky bun if that makes any sense. There are hints of dark grains in the back ground but dark fruits are prominent, with a very very slight bitterness in the after-taste. Its all very well balanced - almost artificially so. Its kind of like someone was trying make the most middle of the fairway example of what a quadruple is, and once you understand this one, you can then venture into the others.

Et oui, je suis votre brasserie depuis ces tout débuts, dans les années 90, jai pu constater les bières qui on perdu de leur gabarit (fin du monde et maudite) mais voici lexception qui tient encore la route la tête haute: La trois-pistole. Premièrement, cette bière est brune et non noire, quelquun connait des bières de style belge foncièrement noire? La couleur approche du noir oui mais avec la lumière elle devient brune (un peu comme la Nuit dautomne de Frampton, chef doeuvre de bière brune extrêmement foncée). Dans tout les cas, la Trois-pistoles est une bière de maîtrise totale, son amertume est adoucit avec un sucre brun quasiment fumée, il y a du cacao, un peu de reglisse noir, un fond boisée et malté, de même que des épices du genre cumin, cannelle et une petite amertume de bon aloi. Seule chose que je lui reproche est un arrière goût collant de houblon ou malt que lon retrouve dans toute les bières dunibroue, jimagine quil sagit dune marque de commerce, mais même lexcellent Terrible avait ce défaut.","Saint-Alban, Quebec, CANADA","BrunTremens"

2263,"2016-06-01",3.8,"Reviewed March 22, 2014.

A: Pours a dark ruby color with some impressive carbonation. The head is two fingers high, and off-white in shade. Texture wise, it looks extremely fizzy (like soda) and has very poor retention. No lacing is left behind.

S: Wow, this is really spicy. While the yeast dominates, the subtle notes of chocolate and brown sugar help give it some depth. The more it warms up, the more I notice its impressive dark fruit notes, and the more I like it. Nitpick: the yeastiness could be toned down slightly.

T: It starts off very fruity - mostly dark fruits, but there are hints of cherries as well. Bready, spicy yeast builds up slightly in the middle before a caramel and chocolate finish. While a bit simple, its also very pleasant and easy to enjoy. Actually, I shouldnt call it simple: pour in the dregs, and this becomes a richer, more complex offering, varying some of the malt and ester notes beyond caramel and dark fruits, respectively.

M: Holy frig, this is drinkable and light. Not only that, its surprisingly clean, without a hint of the 9% coming through. The dry finish and healthy carbonation means one could be inclined to chug this - but why would you want to? With the dregs, the body becomes fuller, the cleanliness goes away, and the finish becomes a little sweeter.

O: A lot of people seem to dislike Unibroues yeast profile - Im not one of them. As always from Unibroue, the alcohol is concealed marvelously, without sacrificing anything in the way of richness or depth. Thank cripes this is very readily available, because Ill definitely drink this again.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

2263,"2016-03-19",3.7,"Taken from a sampler pack. Cellared 1 year.

Another great beer by another great Canadian Brewery

Smells like a Belgian Tripel/Quad. Very sweet, with alcohol undertones.

Pours a dark brown/red colour. Head at beginning similar to Guinness, but it almost dissapears by the end.

Taste is very sweet almost sugary. No booze flavour.

Good amount of carbonation. Little aftertaste, especially for a 9% beer.

 Overall I was very happy with this beer. I will be purchasing as a gift pack, but not on a 6 pack of its own.

2263,"2016-03-19",4.4,"Originally rated on 8/4/08. It poured a dark brown body, with a light tan cap. The aroma was really nice, a mixture of cherries, apples, banana, and plum, all ripe like the bottle says. The fruit carries over into the taste, where there is also malt, yeast and a sublte sweetness that blend very well together. Even with the high alc. content it is very smooth, with a creamy mouthfeel. A beer worth seeking out for sure.","Texas, USA","BeerRenter76"

2263,"2016-03-01",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2016 Bottle into a balloon glass. Very dark brown brew, opaque and smelling of dark sugar and yeast. Highly carbonated and at 9%, barely a hint of alcohol noted. Medium bodied, yeasty with a mild flavor of dark fruit, lots of maltiness, this is a pleasant, but somewhat understated brew. I let the bottle sit at room temperature for an hour or so to bring up more flavor, and certainly the warmer it gets, the more complex it is. The spiciness comes out, as does the alcohol, fruits and malt after another hour or so of sitting. As the website suggests, a temperature near 60f maximizes the taste profile, and my appreciation. Lets settle for subtle flavors when chilled. The Unibrow website offers a lot of information about this brew, but nothing on the hops used. At 15 IBU, obviously they were an afterthought. A fine brew hidden for a while by excessive refrigeration and effervescence.","Massachusetts, USA","migwell"
2263,"2016-02-27",3.9,"Mostanra már világossá vált, hogy a kanadai főzetek, különösen az Unibroue sörei a kifinomult elegancia képviselői, harsány és közönséges, robbanásszerűen ható karakterre felesleges is számítani az esetükben, különösen, ha a quadrupelek egy mintapéldányáról beszélünk. Bár azt, hogy a kategória jelenlegi 6. legjobb söreként tekintsünk rá talán túlzásnak érzem, összességében mégis egy kifogástalan belga hangulatú főzet tárul elénk a felnyitását követő percekben. Vörösesbarna színe puha és krémes habbal osztozik, illatai teltek, édeses malátásak, élesztősen sokszínűek. A kortyok gömbölyűek, simák és tartalmasak, gabonás alapoktól vezéreltek. Az ízvilág homogén jegyek halmaza, kiugrásoktól mentes, melyben minden egyes elem a helyén van - egyenes nyomvonalú, szigorú hangulatú szerkezet ad otthont a mérnöki módon megszerkesztett komponenseknek. Kenyérhéjas, kelt tésztás keretbe burkolva sejlenek fel a száraznak ható, visszafogott intenzitással bíró aszalványos, mazsolás színezetű elemek, majd állnak össze egy krémes állagú, bársonyos jellegű, simulékony és jól ismert mondanivalót hordozó karakterré a mérsékelt vérmérsékletű ízjegyek.","HUNGARY","adster"

Dark brown, perhaps slightly cloudy (hard to tell whe. Its dark). Slight off-white head.

Medium body. Creamy, slick and a tad oily texture. Carbonation just a little on the lively side (which I think works very well with this beer). Finish long finish with plum, bread and the carbonation.

Aroma is dates, figs, black grapes, raisins, sweet malt. On the palate, caramel notes also emerge along with a wisp of chocolate, especially as it warms. Yes, this beer is better when given a bit of time in the glass. 
Very nice medium body and pronounced effervescence help make the mouthfeel satisfying without being heavy. Similarly, the alcohol is present, but as a warm note not a burn.
Its self-defeating for a brewer to compare a beer to port, especially old port, but I can sympathize with the impulse here. They arent the same, and yet theyre reaching for the same thing: a rich yet restrained beverage for a cold afternoon, a fine meal or just dessert,
Its a pleasure to drink a big beer that is light on its feet, whose makers are happy to present it as mellow rather than ""wrecking."" A rebuke to American craft beer.","","Pumpkin87"

2263,"2014-11-13",4.8,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at room temperature.

A: Pours a deep, dark, rich red-brown, rather like a well-buffed, well-aged cherry wood desk, while forming an impressively thick head of just barely off-white foam. Holding the beer to daylight reveals faint ruddy highlights in an otherwise cloudy brown delicious-looking mass. Even after minutes of dissipation, the head remains as a half-finger cap atop the brew.

S: Diabolically sweet, as one might expect from reading the side of the pack. Dark fruits swirl about a dance floor in the arms of candi sugar and that Unibroue yeast, to the background tune of sweet caramel malt. Plums, grapes, raisins, and cherries intermingle with one another, and theres no shortage of dark bready hints as well, from pumpernickel to rye.

T: Oh, a heady, heady brew this is for a malthead with a yen for yeast! The nose promised all and lied about none of it. The flavor profile explodes from the moment it passes the lips through the finish, all the various notes in harmony. The dark fruits swirl about a palate of sweet dark breads and candi sugars, with no one or even group of flavors taking center stage. The flavors remain balanced and strong through the finish, lingering sweet and sticky on the tongue.

M: Creamy and sticky, with a medium carbonation that fills it out nicely.

O: Unibroue knows its Belgian ales, that is indisputable. This is one of the finer offerings along those lines Ive had, and I come back to it time and again.

2263,"2014-09-23",4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 9% and there a brief description on the back label. 
Appearance: The body has a dark brownish color with some lighter brownish amber highlights. It looks like it has a slight haze and it has lots of fine carbonation running up the sides of the glass. From the pour I got an inch of light tan foam. This foam fades slowly to ring of foam at the edge of the glass. A quick swirl excites the foam. Lacing is minimal.
Smell: Its aroma is very inviting and full of deep fruity and yeasty notes. I gets notes of red grapes, raisins, plums and over ripe pears. These notes are surrounded by a pleasant sweet bready maltiness with just the very slightest hint of the 9% abv. 
Taste / Palate: Like the aroma its flavor follows in its footsteps. The has a good full body with loads of malty, yeasty and dark fruitiness. I also get nice mild notes of vanilla extract along with some alcohol which adds another nice layer of complexity. Mouth feel is smooth and full with lots of soft carbonation.","New York, USA","generallee08"

I wish I had more as I feel this would a great beer to enjoy over the course of a night spent next to the fire reading a good book.

Taste is exactly what you expect from the aroma. Lots of sweet, dark fruits up front, with a touch of chocolate and alcohol spiciness. Under that initial blast, you can taste some hops, which help to balance the sweetness of the beer and it does a good job. Reminded of dark chocolate on top of tart, dark cherries.

2263,"2014-06-15",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 5-16-12- 
Served in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a dark brownish brew with a reddish tint. Upon serving there was a light white head that faded rapidly to give a medium level of lacing.

Smell  The aroma is heavy of dark fruits with notes of roasted malt and brown bread. It is mixed with a light yeast, spice and chocolate aroma. It is quite nice.

Taste  The taste starts out as dark fruit and cocoa. Its a nice dark chocolate covered cherry and raisin taste mixed with a brown bread flavor. As the taste advances the fruit and the bread remain but the chocolate begins to fade. In the middle some tastes of yeast and a light spice come to the tongue. From there a lighter caramel and toffee sweetness mix. All these flavors persist to the end where they are met with a lighter alcohol flavor that leaves a warming sweet taste on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The body is on the creamier side with a medium level of carbonation. Both are quite fitting for the sweeter complex flavors of the brew. The body provides enough thickness to where it can really permeate the tongue while the carbonation suits the sweeter flavors well.

Overall  A very nice tasting Belgian dark. A great flavor profile with a wonderful aroma and feel. A brew to try.","","Darkmagus82"

2263,"2014-05-21",3.6,"Reviewed from notes.
This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a nice ruddy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that died within about a minute. It left a nice stringy foamy lacing.
The smell had a good amount of raisins, honey, and plums making it fairly sweet.
The taste was basically sweet and allowing a decent amount of Belgian spices come in to start to take over as it warmed a bit.
On the palate, it sat about a medium on the body and showing that this is more of a sipper and had a good smooth carbonation about it.
Overall, I say this was a good Belgian Strong ale well worthy of having again and quite possibly as a nice dessert by itself at the end of the day.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

This doesnt make it bad it makes it a bit less then perfect. This does have a cracking amount of raisin and other similar fruits, it has a great colour, but little or not head. You might like the up front fizz that distracts you from the delivery, but you might miss the middle as I did. Nearly but not quite","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
2263,"2014-01-16",4.1,"341ml bottle. Murky dark brown with a foamy tan head. Aroma is chocolate, raisins, dates, cherry, pepper and bread. Taste is caramel, molasses, chocolate, plums, spices and licorice. Medium body, lively carbonation, creamy texture.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","ametras"
2263,"2014-01-13",5.0,"Pours a dark, plum reddish color, complete with a foamy head at the top about two fingers high that fizzles down to a modest ring over the first minutes of consumption. Viscous in appearance, and cloudy as well. Isn't too showy, but looks good.

Contains a similar flavor profile at the front reminiscent to Maudite, with a larger focus on the spices, as well as dark fruits. For a year round offering, this flavor provides most seasonal winter warmers a run for their money: cinnamon, ginger, clove, and allspice, as well a load of black pepper at the finish. Dark fruits are very prominent, especially of the darker variety - raisins, prunes, and figs, to name a few. Finishes with a caramel/toffee flavor that melds with a mild bitterness to round out the spices and any potential sweetness. Slightly spicy, but nothing too intense. The alcohol is hidden rather well, especially at 9%. Really good - exactly what I'd expect from this brewery.

The flavor is a bit different, and is a little less heavy on the spices, as well as displaying a rigorous amount of maltiness and dried fruit character. Caramel is immediately at the front, followed by a little bit of chocolate. After, notes of raisins and prunes immediately wash away the sweetness, followed by a grainy bitterness, and a little bit of the spices mentioned earlier (cinnamon is the most predominant). The yeast is present here, especially with the bottle's age, and while the hops are faded, there is a mild herbal bitterness at the finish (which is close to black tea in flavor). Not too carbonated, but very full in character and comforting to drink. A solid dark Belgian-style ale.

This appeals to me with a bit of age as the sweetness is usually cut down dramatically with a bit of time. This delivers all the goods that a spiced, dark ale of this nature should have - dried, dark fruitiness, some spices, minimal sweetness, and little bit of that unique, wild Belgian yeasty character. This isn't even from Belgium and it's more enjoyable than half of the basic dark ales that come from there. I don't usually drink beers like this anymore but this is a very welcome addition to my cellar from time to time.

Nez riche et très complexe, belle intensité, très agréable, ça met en appétit! En bouche, pétillement élevé sur la langue, breuvage bien mousseux, onctuosité intéressante au palais. Au goût, domination de la levure et des épices, avec une pointe dalcool, le tout donnant un effet très chaleureux en bouche. Aussi, saveurs de pain légèrement grillé, caramel, léger chocolat, avec des fruits foncés significativement plus subtils en bouche quau nez. Lamertume est plutôt faible, mais tout de même bien présente. Belle complexité, intensité adéquate, excellente bière. On dit que le vieillissement est très bénéfique à cette bière. Personnellement, jai dégusté de la Trois-Pistoles vieillie jusquà 3 ans et 9 mois que jai trouvé moins pétillante et moins amère, pour un résultat plus doux, plus velouté, plus rond et plus harmonieux.

Complex aroma of ripe and dark fruits, bread, toasted malt, port wine and spices. Interesting, but Im not sure what this will taste like. Alcohol becomes more evident with warning. 

Taste - the flavor components one would infer from my description of the aroma are all there, yet the flavor is a bit different than I expected. More and richer malt flavor for one thing. More subtle spiciness for another. Not quite as bold or enticing as the premier Belgian counterparts (e.g., Rochefort 8), but a fine balanced brew that avoids the over-spicing or imbalance that sometimes besets Belgian style ales. Enjoyable and lingering aftertaste with a striking dark fruit flavor. High ABV partially hidden.

Molasses and blackberries. Generally sweet but a mostly dry finish. Nice and juicy despite the rich aged red fruit flavors. Complex cherry cordials. 2014 version easily beats the 2012 vintage.

Very fruity. Flavors follow with plum and other dark fruits. Some yeast and port wine characters in there as well. It's hard to put a fine point on it, but still very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium with medium amount of carbonation.  Smooth and easy on the palate but with some spice to it. Overall, I was surprised by this Canadian brew. Caught me by surprise.

Very dark ruby red (deep purple in a different light) with a huge light biege head which falls away to a good covering.

Out of the bottle Trois Pistoles pours a deep burgundy brown color that actually has some transparency to it. A bubbly tan head fizzes and fades to a collar and leaves a few spots of lace on the glass.

The nose is full of raisins, cherries, plums, and a bit of figs. Dark caramel malt is kind of light compared to the fruit. A little bit of ethyl alcohol is also noticeable in the back.

In line with the nose, the flavor is full of dark and orchard fruit. Some light caramel and bready malt up front supports raisins, cherries, plums, and figs. A white grape note imparts a crisp tartness at the end of the sip.

The body is actually a little bit on the light side, with bubbly crisp carbonation. It has a grainy feel up front with some tartness at the end.

Trois Pistoles is the darkest and heaviest of the brewers original lineup, witha dark roasted coffee brown color and head that never fully recedes. Aroma is dark berries, heavy caramel malt and the signature yeast of the style. Sweet front and finish, bitter middle, though bitter isnt the right word here.

A one finger white foamy head lingers and eventually subsides, leaving a ring and a small surface film. Aroma is spicy and a bit of banana ester, maybe. First taste matches that, maybe adds a bit of fruitiness, but may change as it warms up. Mouthfeel is medium, not very thick and creamy, etc. Alcohol hidden pretty well for 9%. Later note: the beer having warmed up and me having finished most of it, Iâd say this is pretty similar to Affligem Noel.","Martinsburg, West Virginia, USA","mnoud"

Appearance a very dark, murky, dirty brown with a very thin off white head that rims around the glass.  Aroma of Belgian yeast, dark fruit, plums, a bit of sweet, a bit of pepper.  Taste is really yeasty, getting banana with a very very soft sour note, like a banana thats been left out for two days (as if I know what that would taste like, but I can imagine).  Additional element of pepper, smoothness from yeast, has a kick in the back end from the alcohol, dark fruit/fig quality, a bit of molasses.

2263,"2011-10-04",3.8,"Ported from BA.

Appearance:
Dark brown, similar to the color of the bottle. Through light more of a Dr. Pepper type color. Thats also consistent with the head, which dissipated very quickly and left minimal lacing.

Smell:
Belgian candy and a grapey flavor sticks out. It smells kind of like a dry champagne. I always find Belgian smells exciting, and this is no different.

Taste:
Again, the flavor initially reminds me of a dry champagne. It gives way to dark fruit flavors and oranges. Lots of orange actually. Imagine a dry mimosa in a glass. Very different.

Mouthfeel:
Bubbly and tingly. I have to make a champagne comparison for the 3rd category in a row.

Intense aromas of dark cherries, dark chocolates, and caramel. Medium-bodied, not one single bit of hiding that sweet alcohol flavor, and flavors of sweet malts, chocolates, cherries, spices with a refreshing and enticing dry finish with sweet notes of caramel aftertastes. It is getting very difficult to choose which Unibroue brew is the best  but then, why choose?!","Mansfield, Texas, USA","AWMiller"
2263,"2011-09-25",3.8,"I poured a 12oz bottle into a Belgian ale glass.Appearance: Dark brown color with dark red overtones. Forms a small, yellowish, sudsy head which evaporates almost entirely. Small, slowly-crawling carbonation bottles are visible around the edge.Smell: A basket of dark fruits: cherry, plum, fig, pomegranate, etc. A very organic, authentic fruit smell with slight presence of alcohol.Taste: Sometimes I think I should just have a template for my beer reviews because many of the ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"" tend to taste extremely similar, if not exactly alike. Its the certain ""je ne sais quoi"" that separates them. Not that Unibroue Trois Pistoles is bad - far from it. Its more like the best kind of generic.Much like the nose indicates the palate here is a mélange of dark fruits. Cherry being the most prominent. Its sweet and rich, but never cloying. The beer finishes with a sharp, slightly dry bitterness and alcoholic kick. It reverts back to the fruit notes just as it goes down to bring it back full circle to the sweetness. The aftertaste is surprisingly clean - no sticky syrupy sensation, nor any dry alcohol residue. Im surprised.Mouthfeel: Only medium-bodied with a slight fizziness or minor vibration across the tongue. Drinkability: For such a big beer brewed in the style of Belgian strong dark ales, Trois Pistoles almost seems to be deliberately drinker-friendly. The palate is complex and tasty, but never cloying. The alcohol is noticeable, but not distracting - even at 9% ABV. The mouthfeel is thin and the aftertaste is clean and CO2 doesnt cause belching after each swig. This beer is dangerously drinkable!Overall, I think this is a good example of a what a Belgian strong dark ale can be as made by people other than Belgians.

Pours a dark brown colour with a small light beige head. Strong aroma of ripe fruits such as plum, alcohol and mandarin orange.

2263,"2011-09-06",4.1,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.

Appearance: Opaque and near black, but a tiny glimmer of red comes through in the light. Bubbly head and legs. Looks more dark brown once it nears the bottom of the Snifter.

Aroma: Dark fruit galore - plum, figs, raisins and various other sweet fruits which I cant identify. Some light banana as well.

Taste: Very nice mix of the semi-sweet and earthy. Plums and raisins are in full form, but notes of banana, clove and musty wood are apparent as well. Very complex, but surprisingly a little mild.

Palate: Low carbonation, full and chewy body that is pretty smooth. Finish is actually somewhat dry. Unfortunately, it is slightly watery; not sure how it can be both full bodied and watery, but there you go.

Overall: Very nice BSDA, with lots of complexity, but a little subdued and watery. Still great, just not the best of the best.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

All around the nose on this is just very spice focused. The flavor is dry and spicy and almost a bit overwhelming at first, but as the beer warms it opens up quite a bit, balances its self out well, and sweetens up a tad.

Taste is very much like the aroma with the prunes and raisins being the dominant flavors and an almost wine-esque, dry finish to it. For such a high ABV beverage, this is very smooth and drinkable.

It smelled like fruit cake, but not in a negative way.  Brown sugar, belgo-yeast, cherries, plums and figs.  Wonderful aroma.  And the flavor only accentuates the smell.  On the palate it is delicate, hiding shyly its high-ish ABV, but is full bodied enough to intensify the flavors.  You get all the ripe fruits and brown sugar-laden fruit cake action from the aroma, but the finish is slightly boozy-sweet with notes of port wine.

2263,"2011-02-07",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2012 Trois Pistoles poured a dark and opaque brown with a violet hue. Slightly less than one finger of creamy beige head developed and quickly receded.

The aroma is extremely complex. If there is anyone out there that wished to argue that all beers are similar or you cant appreciate them as you would a fine wine  I challenge them to smell this beer.

Ill have to have a more focused tasting sometime but the aromas I mentally jotted down were of plums, raisins, brandy, rum, spices, roasted malts, and a touch of chocolate. A very impressive nose on this brew.

The flavor is an extension of those nose. You are taken on a ride starting with roasted malts tinted with caramel and molasses flavors. As the malts fade away I get lots of ripe dark fruits that seem both a touch sweet and a touch bitter. The finish is dry and nutty with a touch of smooth sweet chocolate.

The complexity of the flavors in this beer have done a wonderful job of concealing the 9% ABV. Even when savored the bottle seems to be gone far too fast.

It is medium bodied with a thick and smooth mouthfeel that holds through the entire beer. This was an absolutely delightful beer.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"
2263,"2011-02-03",3.3,"Poured into an snifter.

3.5 A: Dark brown in color. One finger of frothy light tan head that falls fairly quickly and doesnt leave much lacing.

3.5 S: This one needed to warm up quite a bit before the aromas started poking out. Plenty of fruitiness: plum, grape, and raisin. Theres even a touch of citrusy lime in there. Also a touch of solvent. Pleasant, but fairly weak.

4.0 T: Taste for the most part follows the nose. Dark fruitiness with plum, grape, raisin, and prune. Some toffee in there as well. The malts are okay, but somewhat boring. The good part about this beer, as in most Unibroue beers, is the yeast. They use a wonderful strain. Peppery and a unique yeastiness not really found anywhere else.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Perhaps a touch too much carbonation, but I do like the spritziness. This could use a bit more body. Otherwise very smooth.

3.5 D: This is a pretty tame beer overall and one that just about anyone could enjoy. Indeed, I enjoyed it, but it isnt mindblowing. I love the flavor of Unibroue yeast, but prefer it in a better application (such as Maudite).

Starts with assertive dark fruits, followed by delightful sweet malt bread flavours on the sides of the tongue and then a dry, very mildly sour finish. Full bodied.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Nice and creamy.

Drinkability: Very high drinkability. The alcohol is masked very well so this one could sneak up on you.

Overall: Very good beer overall. Another strong offering from Unibroue. I would definitely recommend this one.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

Pours a dark brown color with a small off-white bubbly head that effervesces and dies quickly. Reminds me of what a Trappist beer should look like. Lots of good smells, especially grapes/raisins, a bit of vanilla, and other dried fruits. Tastes very similar to the smell, with a bit of bite to it, but has a slight roasted taste to its back-end. Average mouthfeel, but has an assertive aftertaste. Pretty decent beer overall.","Highland Park, Illinois, USA","soccer290"

Definitely a beer that you sip as you go along, its not the gulpers beer. Its a pretty strong beer at 9% abv, but it isnt too obvious through the flavor but you do get a slight burn and warmth as you go further into the beer.

2263,"2010-09-10",4.8,"Appearance:  poured into a trappist goblet; dark chocolate brown with a rich foamy head that lasts a long time before shrinking to a modest collar; this thing has more legs than a zz top song--when tilted, a cascade of bubbles curtains down the side, leaving a rich and beautiful lace.  Aroma:  sweet, dark rich fruit--cherries and plums--and booze; some caramel maltiness and a little earthy leather.  Taste:  wow.  rich and sweet, yet light and delicate; sweetly tinged dark fruit notes give way to earthy dark grains and malts in the middle, before an extremely mellow yet powerful booziness kicks in.  Finish:  amazingly clean and refreshing; a lingering sweetness, breadiness, and warming alcohol, yet the tongue and palate are washed clean for the next sip.  Notes:  Amazing beer.  Incredibly rich, yet somehow light.  Incredibly smooth and velvety on the tongue, yet perfectly carbonated.  Sweet and fruity, yet not cloying.  I loved how the sweet faded slightly into the toasted brown bread.  The finish was incredibly simple and refreshing after the rich and complex sweetness.  I could go on and on.

When held up to the light, the yeast is easily visible. The aroma is quite strongly alcoholic, and redolent with port and ripe berries. There are some weak floral hops to begin, but they are soon overcome by a burnt caramel sweetness, which in turn segues into a smooth, alcoholic port finish. The description of this beer as comparable to an old porto is very apt, as it does taste very much that way, and is thus a very classy and enjoyable beer indeed.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

A - Dark bronze with redish orange hues on the edges. A larger than average, thick, fomay, creamy, meringue-like head. About average retention that settles into a sticky thin layer of lace.

T - Lighter flavors for the style, but similar to the nose. A good amount of dark fruit (see above with plum being strongest). Sweet, juicy taste with a good amount of sweetness.

Ap - Pours very dark with an uneven, foamy and dissipating creamy head. Little to no lacing.

Ar - Dark fruits are noticeable right away which lead to an interesting earthy aroma. Theres definitely a bit of noticeable alcohol and anise in the nose as well. Also present are bread and yeast. Very complex. You really have to dig for the aroma though it is not overpowering.

T - Immediately, those Belgian yeasty spices are very accessible with flavors of clove and coriander being most easy to recognize. The beer is rich with dark dates and sweet raisins. The finish is long with the spices continuing to give and give.

P - Texture is oily. It collects on the roof of your mouth like deer tallow. Swirling the beer in the glass reveals a real slippery texture as well: zero retention. Medium bodied.

O -  A beautiful beer. Different and exciting. Another good offering from Unibroue.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","chickenflea"

Then I get a wiff of Unibroues special yeast. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Very smooth that is, with some sweet beginning notes and a bitter middle. 9% ABV is very well-hidden.

2263,"2010-04-26",4.3,"I have had this beer many times but am just getting around to reviewing it. It reminded me why I like quads and suggested that this may be the perfect cold, rainy-day beer. I would normally reach for a porter or stout but I think this is so much more than most of those could bring to the table. It pours a deep, cider like reddish-brown. There was a two-finger head which quickly settled, leaving only light lacing. The nose was a blend of alcohol, raisins, cherry, clove, sweet malt and a yeasty aroma I cant describe. Carbonation is heavy. The taste follows the nose perfectly with the addition of some slight bitterness to temper the sweetness - a lovely interplay that really works. At 9% I certainly couldnt drink this all day/night but I might want to. This isnt my favorite Unibroue beer, but it is a great one, nevertheless.","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","regspeir"

This one was a little sweeter though, almost as though the fruit were slightly sweetened or barely dessicated.  Very smooth and velvety in the mouth with a light carbonation that enhanced the sweetness of the fruit and allowed some spice to develop after.  Alcohol was very well hidden again, so be very careful if you want to try more than one!

Alcohol is not overpowering and gives it a nice warm feeling.  I dont have too much experience with Belgian dark ales to compare this one to, but its very tasty.  I think it could have used a slightly thicker body as the carbonation, while a good amount, made it just a little to fizzy to drink.

The flavor is mildly sweet for the style but still right in the normal range for a good quad/BSDA.  Mouthfeel is full and lively.  All of Unibroues beers are well-made.

It also had a little bit of a dry taste to it - like wine. Basically, everything up to this point was reminiscent of wine. ...And it didnt stop there.

Appearance: dark cloudy brown with a long lasting thin head. No lace.

Smell: Malty, as would be expected. I enjoy the spiciness (corriander?) in the aroma. I am pleasantly surprised by pleasant yeast smells. Typically, I find that these detract rather than contribute (like this one).

Taste: More sweet than alcohol oily. In fact, this is rich and full-bodied even for the style. Strong candy sugar flavors and virtually no hop. This brew has an unusually high carbonation. Again, the yeast adds pleasant flavors and a touch of spiciness.

2263,"2009-08-04",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 5, 2009 Gusher. Dark copper pour, lots of yeast floating round. Good head, nice persistence. Would have liked some lacing though.
Aroma is lovely, with the Unibroue yeast, plums, prunes, blackberries, candi sugar, caramel, nougat, red wine and sweet sherry. Very perfumy/rose-like.
Taste shows more of that classic yeast, lots of residual sweetness (candi sugar, I guess). Esters are reminiscent of lighter fruit than the aroma, namely pear and white grapes (more akin to a tripel!). Some alcohol, but reasonably well masked.
Not as full a body as youd expect, but it works well the the lighter flavours. Not too much carbonation (unlike a lot of the Unibroue beers). Very slight warming on the palate. Quite enjoyable.

Pours like natural root beer - very well-carbonated. Head is thin and fades quickly.

Smell is powerful - caught whiff from eye level even when pouring. Carbonation makes the aroma travel well - good, sarasparilla (sic?) and coriander tones w/Belgian yeast; malt or hop tones are extremely subtle.

Nice molasses backbone with deep caramelized profile and additional yeast and underlying spice tones.

Heavy carbonation at outset makes this much lighter than expected, but still has that nice coating feeling.

Could drink more of this than expected; alcohol is there but hidden well.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Aftertaste is what is remarkable -- has a spicy finish that is truly unique compared to all beers I have ever found.  Sweet but not overdone.  Bitter but not too bitter.  To me it had a marked fruitiness instead of the coffee/molasses/smokey taste found in many strong ales.  Luckily, I bought 6 of these!  Im updating and dropping this a few points.

Additional complex flavors -- yeast and I get some cherry and other fruit.  A bit of smooth chocolate is also present toward the finish.  The 9% goes down very easy.

Aroma is very fruity, boysenberries and coriander herbs are strong. Can smell some sugar sweetness, very nice aroma.

This beer poured a medium to dark brown with a tan head that was of decent depth, maybe two fingers worth.  It had the aroma of sweet dark fruits and maybe a bit of toffee.   It tasted great, I had started a bottle before my meal, a ""Zinc Burger"" at Redcoat Tavern in Royal Oak, MI, and it was great, a decent amount of sweetness and a bit fruit - much like the aroma.  After having had the burger, I would say that it certainly doesnt pair well with guyere cheese and caramalized onions.

Pour was nice though not very unique, with a good amount of carbonation initially, a whispy thick cream layer of head when it settles, fairly thick bodied appearance, and crimson brown in color.  The drinkability of this beer is excellent.  All the flavors come out bold and strong, yet every flows down quite smoothly and not overly heavy.  The actual flavor notes may not be all that unique either, but they come together very well.  It was also alittle more fruity than expected with a good amount of darker, heavier fruits like raisins, fig, date blending with lighter fruits like apples, and mild berries.

It has a rich fruity odor akin to that of a Port Wine. Clearly a Belgian, but smoother and richer than any I had tried in the past It is very sweet with deep overtones of plum and grape.

Aroma mellows down to something more raisiny and with perhaps just a hint of chocolate. Lively carbonation, but not aggressive. Old and aromatic in the mouth - wooden casks fresh from being emptied of fortified wines or brandies, and also fruity - raisin, cherry, plum, even some almond. Upon swallowing theres quite a bite of richly roasted malts, and a tingle of biting noble hops. Some alcohol creeps through, but its remarkably light for a 9% beer - not sticky and thick at all.

Sampling Notes:
Served chilled in chalice glass.
Pours an attractive murky black body with a small dense tan head.
Unique and pungent sort of aroma, somewhat hoppy with notes of citrus, young red wine aromatics of tart blackberry, unripe plum, prune and blueberry. 
Smooth, velvet-like texture, low carbonation, somewhat well-attentuated body making it deceptively strong. 
Suprisingly smooth fruit-driven body for such a dark beer. Hint of dark chocolate and brown sugar at beginning move onto notes of prune, fig, apricot, blackberry, dried fruits and bitter orange lingering. Bitterness is quite high, finishes with drying spice and subtle drying alcohol warmth.
Certainly a unique Belgian-style strong dark ale. Id go as far as to say that hops add an extra, yet complimentary complexity. Very nice indeed.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

2263,"2008-11-27",4.2,"I have a consummate love affair with Unibroue and their beers, and I am not afraid to admit it. I would like to think that she loves me as much as I love her, and together we make the perfect couple. Or, this could all be just a dream and someday I shall awaken to find myself trapped in a world where no brewery by the name of Unibroue exists. Hopefully, such a nightmare will never occur. I cant say for sure, but I believe that their Trois Pistoles was their very first beer I ever tried, and which sealed our fate. Literally, it translates to Three Pistols, and if I recall even more, I picked it up because the name was cool and the cover was gorgeous. Besides their beautiful beers, Unibroue also manages to have some of the most striking label art used on a beer bottle.She poured a dark brown glinting with hues of rusty garnet where the light peeks through. A soft head lurks quietly, drifting off into a thin layer while marking her trail with delicate notes of lace. I raise my glass, and a sweet nose of grain, caramel, malts, and rich fruit greets me. Apples, peaches, berries, and dates are just some of the ripe fruit coloring her nose and hopefully her palate. As is the case with most bottle conditioned beers, her mouthfeel and body is soft and velvety smooth while a refreshing effervescence lets her practically float on top of my tastebuds. Warm and with a lingering alcohol presence which rests at the back of my mouth. Rich winter spices compliment the sweet prunes, raisins, peaches, apples, and melons which help define her palate. Do not be fooled though, for beyond all those delicious fruit essences are a rich malty finish with soft notes of pumpernickel and brandy. Nearing the end of my glass, lightly acidic lemon tingles with a bright presence, keeping Trois Pistoles from being too overbearing.Trois Pistoles was probably my first Unibroue beer and still, to this day, is one of my favorites. But then, I have many favorites in the world of Unibroue, so it is not really a fair comparison. If you dont believe me, then sit down with a few different beers, and then try to pick a favorite. What I do know is that I shall have another, please.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2263,"2008-10-31",3.1,"(small bottle, labeled best before 3/15/08, uh oh, this could be interesting)  Pours dark brown with a white spotty head and little to no lacing.  There is still ample carbonation.  Aroma, hmmm, smells kind of like a pizza box, which tells me that this may be past its prime.  Also smelling some sausage spices, such as oregano and pepper, but I’m not sure how much the pizza box scent is affecting that.  Swirling reduces these odd smells, and brings out the port-like character that is posted in the description.  Further warming starts to dull this cardboard scent, the aroma has greatly improved, and roasted malt makes its presence known. There’s also just a slight hit of tartness as well. Taste is lightly medicinal, with some dark fruits, caramel, and a finish that is lightly peppery and yeasty.  Plum skin is also rather prevalent now in the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium, and the carbonation is still quite lively on the tongue.  The cardboard-like aroma really threw me off in this beer, and it definitely seems to be past its prime.

Sua bela aparência é composta de uma espuma de aparência inicial média e pomposa, coloraçõ marrom-claro e curta longevidade. Apresenta moderada formação de colarinho, coloração marrom-rubi e uma turbidez semelhante ao céu de um dia nublado que está prestes a vivenciar uma tempestade tropical. Ao abrir a garrafa, chega ao nariz uma lufada de frutas vermelhas. O olfato ainda é agraciado com forte presença de malte, notas de melado, uva e vinho tinto colonial e manteiga de amendoim. O sabor inicial apresenta leve doçura e acidez, sendo transplantado por moderado amargor em seu final de curta duração.

While I still think it’s true to some extent, this one came much closer. Pours a very dark, slightly reddish brown - nearly black - with a quickly dissipating head (seriously, the thing disappeared). The aroma is right on - reminiscent of some fantastic Belgian quad... though slightly less potent, and with more sour cherry. Notes of dark fruits and baking spices prevail. The flavor is trying so hard to be the Rochefort 10, but just doesn’t live up. It’s a little more watery, and the flavor doesn’t linger as long as I’d like.

Spicy and sweet with notes from the aroma that come out at different points: sweet at first with fruit notes (raisins, dark cherries, and prunes) and finished with a plethora of spice notes (cinnamon, coriander, and ginger mostly).  A bit of a funky sourness lingers behind everything - don;t know if this pleases me or not.  Light bodied on the palate with very lively carbonation - too lively for my taste, but typical of the Belgian ale style.

Pours a hazy brownish amber brew with a heavy tan head that has some nice retention. Aroma of roasted caramel malt, dried figs, brown sugar, some dark berries, and yeast.

The flavour is nothing short of spectacular, though it perhaps doesnt pack quite the same deep flavour as say, Rochefort 10, it is actually better balanced. No single flavour dominates, the bitterness, alcohol, licorice, spices and dried fruit all working together perfectly.

2263,"2008-04-14",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2010 An awesome beer!  Gift from Sarah for my 32nd birthday. (Thanks!) Extremely dark brown color with a light, light brown bubbly head.  This beer leaves no lacing.  Sweet aroma with a little dark candy sugar in the nose, a little spicy and earthy.  Yeasty up front, but theres a strength in the back that makes you quickly forget about the yeasty sourness.  Together, these balance well and give an overall punch-like experience and only a slightly sour, yeasty finish.  Light-bodied for such a dark beer (and a Belgian strong ale at that), but superbly tasty with a kicking flavor.  The alcohol didnt hit me hardly at all.  Looking forward to my next bottle!  More malty and not as light-palated and yeasty as alot of beers of this style usually are to me.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Toffee cocoa and vanilla.  Bright fruity esters and a wet wood nose.  Great complexity.  Rather full bodied with that nice Unibroue yeast character.  Tight effervesecence and sugary malts.

Aroma is strong and very complex, man this stuff smells good. Dark fruits such as plum, black cherries, and dates fill the air. Add a touch of maple syrup, cinnamon, and nutmeg and sweet yeast to round out the finish of the bouquet. The taste is again very flavorful. Black cherries and plums mix with brown sugar and spices to add a very sweet but wonderful flavor on the tounge.

Chocolate, cloves, pepper and figs invigorate while a wrap-around fruity nature comprised of plums and chocolate covered strawberries pull at the heart strings. Some cherry pipe tobacco and a spicy complex akin to Christmas (cranberries, orange peel and nutmeg.) Effervescent, but not over the top. Titillating on the palate.

Flavors of mildly sweet fruits came through in the flavor as well as it eased into the finish.  I almost seemed to cleanse the palate with each sip and made for an excellent dessert drink.

Big fruity Unibroue yeast smell, sometimes it bugs me, but here it works better than in most of their other beers.  Raisins and some light dark fruit.  A bit sweeter than most of their beers and a bit fuller on the malt bill.  Alcohol, hidden.  Creamy, with robust small bubbled carbonation.  The flavor is in line with the nose, though the alcohol pops out quite a bit .  Sweet estery goodness.  The apple pops back a bit, the banana up.  This has some nice dark malt complexity.

Dark scarlet color, thick and foamy beige head that holds its form against the glass indefinitely. Fruit upfront, a little too sweet but followed by a spicy sourness that evens things out a bit. Still a little unbalanced, but good overall. Creamy palate with a little carbonation on the middle of the tongue.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"
2263,"2008-02-18",3.6,"Bottle. First of I opened the bottle and the beer spilt out for an inordinate length of time. So, off to a bad start there then!  Nose of cream, raisins, some alcohol and malt. Pours a murky dark brown beer with (once all the beer had finished spewing out the bottle) a small  brown head.  Mouthfeel is soft, medium body. Malty, bready, sweet with a small burn of alcohol.  Some cloying. Very much reminiscent of a belgian beer - since typed Ive noted  its classification - but not as well put together. All in all a not bad beer but the alcohol intrudes too much for me so I dont share such a high rating as others.","Greater London, ENGLAND","DownsouthGav"

2263,"2008-01-30",3.6,"Let me start off by saying that I really dont like this paticular style of Belgian Ale too much, but this one is decent for the style. Aroma is dominated by figs and persimmons, followed by tangy smells with clove and cinnamon too. Hops smell like equal bit flowers and grapefruit but are far in the distance. Appearance is quite nice. Large creamy light brown head with some okay lacing and retenetion covers a very dark orange (nearly dark brown) murky body. Taste is bitter with a yeasty-near Celery finish, this is not my cup of tea, although I have only had one other BSA that tasted like that (cannot remember which one, but I rated it around the 10th of January).

The nutmeg really is apparent in the flavor with much of the yeast and Belgian candy sugar is evident as well.  Really drinks nice.

Fruity aromas (apples, pears, grapes, plums) with tons of brown sugar and molasses notes. Very doughy as well. Rich and complex smell. When it hits your tongue, its immediately bubbly, with doughy, bready characters everywhere. Then, as you dig a little deeper into the taste, you notice the beautiful subtleties beneath - plums, dates, figs, raisins, brown sugar, wine, fresh apples. There is so much to taste in this beer, and not a sign of anything bad happening in its near future.

2263,"2007-12-21",3.9,"1 to 1 and a half year old bottle, poured into its namesake glass (which I didnt know existed until I saw it for the first time at the store!).  Pours dark reddish brown, mostly clear until the very end where you get some particles, with a large fizzy beige head.  Aroma is vinous and malty, lots of plum and red wine notes, some toffee, and some slightly peppery gingery clove type of smell, which is the only way I can describe that Unibroue character.  Taste is a nice blend of toffee, toast, and cocoa malt flavors with a vinous red wine, grape and raisin flavor and an abundant spicy/sweet clove and cardamon note.  Finishes nothing like I remember the fresh beer, and is very similar to the year-old Chimay Blue I recently had.  Very nutty, hazelnut, with a faint chocolate and coffee note, while the spices take a bake seat.  Fizzy overcarbonated mouthfeel, but thats the name of the game with Unibroue.  Medium bodied, but still substantial, and only slightly warming.  Very good stuff, but it occupies a strange middle ground.  Its not as smooth as Chimay Blue, and yet the spicy notes arent as exciting as Pannepot.  Perhaps another would diminish the poky spice notes to a level that would make this beer really awesome.

Appearance: Pours a really nice murky, dark red, almost black, with a large tan head. Aroma: Sweet candi sugar on top of ripe fruits, with the classic Unibroue yeast as the perfect background character. Taste: Surprisingly refreshing? Wow, thats different for a BSA! Nice yeast character of course, all the sweet elements combine to give it its complexity, very fruity, with decent bitterness (more than Maudite or other BSAs Ive had). The carbonation is perfect, providing just enough bite without distracting from the flavours. The aftertaste is sweet, sort of like a port wine I guess, but I wouldnt say its a defining feature of this fine brew. The aroma seems to get better as time goes on, and the mouth-fell is great, nice sticky malts. Weird, its actually almost mouth-watering. Totally not what I expected. I was expecting something dry, alcoholic, bitter, and roasty. What I get is something fruity, refreshing, lightER than I was thinking. But despite all that, I actually still really like this beer a lot. Id also like to say that the image of the church with the storm-cloudy horse in the sky is incredibly cool looking. I cant wait to try this again after its aged for a few years! EDIT: At room temperature and with the carbonation more settled, this stuff is at its best.

Nose is fruity and sweet, full of malt character.  Slightly thicker-than-water mouthfeel marked by a noticeable astringency (almost a  pleasant burning).  Goes down smoothly.  Flavors of raisin/figs/dates and malt (as in the nose) mingle on the palate with a bit of vinous acidity.  Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so with hints of spice (cinnamon?).  Clean finish with fruity aftertaste is both agreeable and short-lived.","","User57106"

<P>Strong, salty, sharp, spicy aroma that is more like that of an abbey tripel or a saison than that of a dark Belgian ale; smells like a more pale-colored beer than it is. Lemon and orange scents as well as a hint of cherry. Alcohol smell noticeable but not overpowering. 

<P>Pours a cloudy dark brown with a tan to amber hue. Some suspended particulate in the liquid. Moderate to large amount of dark beige head. Looks like a cola.

<P>Very sweet, sugary taste. Pitted fruit (plum, cherry), fruity chocolate, and spice flavors. Alcohol noticeable in the taste. While it smells like a light-colored Belgian ale, it certainly tastes like the dark-colored Belgian-style ale that it is. Relatively dry finish. 

<P>Herbal aftertaste. Medium to heavy body. Oily, fizzy, frothy, and lively in the palate. Easy to drink for such a high alcohol brew. 

<P>Honestly, there is a lower quality character to Unibroue Trois Pistoles than I expected given how highly rated it is. Usually, even if I dont share the common opinion on a highly regarded brew, I understand why people like it so much. Thats not the case with this beer. Its okay, but I have trouble finding the appeal. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.

<P>Re-rate, 2-29-08:

<P>Im re-rating Trois Pistoles as part of Re-Rate Day (February 29, 2008). This beer did not impress me much the first time around, so I figured Id give it another chance. This 12 oz. bottle comes from the same four-pack as the bottle from which I derived my initial rating. I poured it into a Unibroue Maudite glass. Yeasty aroma features apple, bubblegum, Mike and Ike candy, grape juice, lemon, and curry scents. Pours a clear, dark brown, almost a deep purple. Burgundy hue. Thin beige head. Short-lasting lacing. Sweet flavors of candy, fruitcake, and root beer-flavored sucking candy. The finish possesses a sharp tartness and a dry, cola-like taste. The flavors fall broadly within those that one would expect from a strong, dark Belgian Ale, but a weird and not particularly good one. Medium body. Fizzy, oily, and lively in the palate; soda-like. The palate sensations are not pleasant. Unfortunately, Im even less impressed now than I was the first time around. Trois Pistoles is an interesting beer, but not a good one.

Quite rounded and fruity to taste, both sugary and syrupy yet bouyed by a mysterious hoppy presence.  An intriguing, complex beer, and one that masks the high abv well; conisdering the only aspect of the alcohol is faint whispers on the nose and in the warming in the back of the mouth.

2263,"2007-07-06",4.3,"Poured from a bomber.  One of the first craft brews Ive tasted and worth the $7.99.  Dark brown in color, a bit of red in the light.  Malts, spice, fruits, and very complex aroma.  Flavor is equally as fruity but not as pronouced as in the nose.  Subtle hints of ripe fruit, meshed in the intense malt and yeast.  Mouthfeel is a bit too strong in the alchohol burn dept.  One of only a few downers.  Easily overlooked as the rest is so enjoyable.","Oregon, USA","xenthem0nk"

Pours an Earthy brown with a mellow consistently regenerating head.  Nose is of a recently mown orchard....grassy with the nose of dropped fruit on the tires.  Mouth is champagne zingy with some spice and fruit. Finish is rasins and dried apricots.  9% is noticable and present but not overpowering.  Powertool use is Ill advised.  Farm equipment use is forbidden.  This beer was nearly too much for me.  After it warmed a bit in the glass it the ""Bigness seemed tor grow.""

Taste is sweet starts off like candy - mostly mollasses, anise, same fruit concoction and light spiciness is noticeable which is refreshing. Vanilla is in there too! Mouthfeel is pleasantly creamy.

5/12/2007:  Unibroue Trois Pistoles has to be one of my favorite (and one of the best) Unibroue brews...  Dark brown/amber in color with an lasting, foamy, beige-colored head.  The flavor and aroma contain dark fruits, sweet caramel malts, and some interlaced spiciness (clove?).  This beer also tastes strong, but the alcohol is not outwardly distinguishable in the overall flavored.  This beer is very well-balanced overall and has a smooth, medium palate with a generous level of carbonation without being going over the line.

Trois Pistoles poured dark dark mahogany into a snifter. When I hold it to the light there is a tremendous amount of big carbonation bubbles quickly rising to the 2 finger frothy antiqued white head. The head eventually falls to 1 finger and then much later to a cap. Its one of those beers that just looks packed with all sorts of deep flavors.

The smell is really nice. Starts with bread dough and a spicy yeast aroma. That is the backbone but there are many other aromas that compliment each other very nicely. Lots of fruit including plums and bing cherries along with remnants of brandy. There is a big layer of caramel sweetness as well. Very rich and deep.

The malts come strong with each sip including the sweet fruitness. Doughiness and caramel set the stage for the plum, cherries and possibly some black raspberries. Wonderful fruitiness. This is all intemingled with a spiciness from the yeast and a sprinkling of wite pepper. As it warms the alcohol comes through by warming my throat.

Mouthfeel is excellent. Prickly carbonation but in no way offensive. Coating medium body that allows the entire mouth the pleasure of this excellent brew.

Drinkability is really high on this one. Really easy going down because of the body and carbonation. The abv is nearly non-existent except for the warmth in the throat that is perfect for this time of year.

This is a really well made and enjoyable beer. I really try and sip these slowly when I have them but they taste so good and go down so easy its tough. Trois Pistoles is one I go back to over and over.

The aroma consisted of sweet fruits perhaps grapes, cherries, and maybe even plums. Finally it was time to try a taste and the flavors bursted inside of my mouth. This dark ale is very unigue in that it drinks like a beer, but finishes almost like a red wine. Good carbonation and rather smooth to drink, I enjoyed sipping on this for a good while. The strong alcohol content is masked by all of the complex flavors in this beer. Wonderful experience, not an everyday selection but worth the price for a long cold night.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
2263,"2007-05-11",4.1,"750ml bottle, $7.59.  Aroma is fruity with notes of orange, plum, prune, cherry, ruby port, and cola.  Average sized, off-white, foamy head that is mostly lasting but left no lace.  Murky dark brown body.  Flavor is moderately sweet and acidic with a short finish.  Palate is medium bodied with a creamy texture and fizzy carbonation.  Very good brew even though Im not a fan of the style.  The aroma and flavor is of dried fruit, cola, and young port.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"

2263,"2007-05-08",4.2,"Another great beer from Unibroue.   This was actually my first from them but I didnt rate it then.  
It has a wonderfully complex taste, lots of fruits and some hop/malt as well.
The first time I had this it was from a 750ml bottle but this time I got the 12 oz. bottles.  My first impression was that it was excellent but something was missing that kept it from being a truly great beer and I get the same feeling this time.  Im not sure what, but whatever it is La Terrible has it.  Unfortunately its a damn seasonal so I have to wait a while for that one again.....","Temple, Texas, USA","Rotorhead87"

2263,"2007-05-05",3.5,"Man, Im kinda bummed about this one. I think I didnt let it warm up enough before I drank it because I was disappointed with it based on the reviews I have read here. I had high expectations. I had an amazing experience with Unibroues La Fin Du Monde recently and was hoping for a repeat with this one. It wasnt there. Again, perhaps I should try the 750ml instead of the 12oz bottle capped. Nonetheless, the aroma offered up a sharp, distinct black licorice smell up front. Followed by some lesser bubble-gum, banana and maple notes. The yeast is present in the aroma as well, a little earthy. Root beer brown with small head. Bubbly, with a slightly hoppy/bitter bite at the end. Next time Im doing it right with the 750ml at about 55-60 degrees. I look forward to a re-rate with this one....in the mean time, pass me a La Fin Du Monde!","Crofton, Maryland, USA","hoplover406"

2263,"2007-04-30",2.8,"Bottle. The yeast stands out most in this beer. Heavy aromas of earth and basement (cobwebs?) with notes of grass and straw, and port, clove and maple syrup in the background. Its got a lasting head that is off white and fully lasting. Color is a clear, rootbeer brown. Taste is sweet  and midly sour and salty.

Poured the second half of the bottle 4 hours later into a wine glass, with little head.  Its got a faint plastic smell a little similar to Judgement day,  Hmmm, I wonder if it is a hint of corriander?  no wait, banana, thats it.  The head is thick and creamy, with excellent lacing.  The flavor is too light and needs some sweetness, which makes it an excellent beer to pair with food.  Should i give it a 16 or 17?  Hmmm","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
2263,"2007-04-28",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2008 Pours dark deep rosewood, with deep garnet highlights. Mocha head that disolves down to a film very quickly. Aroma has a complex play between spicy yeast, caramel malts, liquorice, and dark fruit.. mainly plum and raisin. In the back is a faint chocolate. There is also  something I cant quite place... almost a cotton-candy and bubblegum mix. As it warms up it starts to reveal its alcohol... like a rum soaked raisin. That rum-raisin carries over into the mouth with other fruit, sherry, and caramel. Somewhere in the begining is a quick dash of cocoa-powder... keep your tongue on it or youll quickly miss it. Big spice, and liquorice come in towards the end, then the caramel sweeps back in to finish it off. It seems to finish too quickly, leaving you to want more. That in turn makes you quickly take another sip. Easy drinking, but as it warms up it lets you know its strength. Overall quite a nice beer, but perhaps a little too overly confident.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

Aroma of roasted malt, cola, nuts, dark fruits / berries. It does smell a bit like a port wine - also smells a bit like Dr Pepper. Taste has the same qualities of Belgian christmas ales - roasted malts, dried dark fruits (prune, raisin, dates), rum and cola with espresso hints and a spicy edge. Finish of spice, berries and cola. A shorter finish than I prefer. Medium to full body. I could do without the taste of cola, but overall its a top brew.","Greater London, ENGLAND","reakt"

What a surprise. The only problem with this beer, as is with most belgian ales, I do not enjoy the soda-like carbonation, but I feel that with this beer it is called for.

While the appearance and aroma are quite honestly unremarkable, this beer closes the gap like a true thoroughbred, blasting down the backstretch to steal the win.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"

Slightly under carbonated but a part from that... The alcohol is an obvious feel to the palate and taste... Flavors are exactly the same as its aromas...

Some dark leaves, but the coriander (OK, I hope its in there) overwhelms everything. Slightly sourish, fruity-coriander infested flavour. Thanks to all the malts, the coriander is not alone there.

Going to have to drink all of this to figure out if I like it or not, it is that different.  Im going to give it a high rating cuz the Sabres are on and I want to finish this review.

2263,"2007-01-28",4.7,"12oz bottle.  rarely have i heard a nice high alc fizz once poured, but this toasted amber brown fade beer in color does.  initially, a 2 inch head, but bubbles down to a thin layer of tiny bubbles atop an aesthetically pleasing brew.  that dominant aromas are of fruit malts, mainly raisin, grape. and plum, and noticable hops.  tastes of sweet red grapes and rapidly disappearing hops are very up-front.  this is the most wine ive ever tasted in a beer, even if it is on the sweeter side of the vine.  the finish is definitely reminiscent of a belgian/abbey/trappist ale - that is, slightly dry, but successfully leaving a flavorful palate.  in addition, this great canadian brew offers a fig newton-esque taste.  a faint hint of oak, rasberries and blackberries carry over from the taste to the finish, which is rather long in duration.    though it is probably my highest rating, i will say it isnt my favorite.  the drinkablility is not as high as the abv.  its more of a beer to admire and respect, and less of a beer with the buddies.","Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA","andyhite"

The initial aroma is what I love about this beer; there is so many distinct notes to it like chocolate, several ripe fruits, maple wood, and many others which I could not fully distinguish. The first sip surprised me with the explosion of flavours I tasted, it lived up to all the hype Ive heard about it. 

This beer is too complex for a beer newbie like me to rate and describe now, but perhaps I will re-rate it once Ive tried more beers.

For now, this is by far the best beer Ive tasted and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a quality beer for a meal.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Jordiam"
2263,"2007-01-27",4.0,"Appearance: Pours a muddy dark brown with a super carbonated one finger head that dissipates very quickly to a paper thin layer. 

Smell: I have grown to love the smell of this style of beer, specifically the offerings from Unibroue. A particular spicy, fruity, malty sweetness that cannot be found anywhere else. 

Taste: The taste mirros the aroma perfectly. Wonderful fruits and malt sweetness, with just a hint of alcohol presence. Spices (nutmeg? cinnamon?) that I cant quite put my finger on linger in the background.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Drinkability: Despite how great this Dark Ale is, I cannot picture myself drinking more than 2 or 3 of these in a sitting. Bewteen the medium/heavy mouthfeel, and the wonderful sweetness this beer has to offer, and the 9% ABV, more than 3 of these could spell trouble.

2263,"2007-01-24",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2007 Easily my favorite from Unibroue.  One of my first Belgian-style ales from years back, and I completely fell in love with it - on a trip to Niagara Falls, drinking it out of a red plastic Solo cup, no less.  It was good then and every single time since, it has not disappointed and has held up exceptionally to some of the more classic names within the style.  Dark ruby red bordering on brown with a distinctly creamy tan head that lasts and laces.  Strongest explosion of dark stone fruits - plums predominant - that I have experienced in an aroma.  Slight roast, brown sugar or chocolate sweetness as well, but the dark fruits really carry this one.  Taste is complex, sweet but not approaching cloying in any way.  Again dark stone fruits, some hints of red wine or port, slightly acidic, and an overarching malt sweetness.  Creamy, not overly carbonated but enough to produce a crisp sipper of an ale.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

The clarity stops a couple centimeters into the glass.  There are certainly living creatures in it.  The aroma is a backdrop of a barn full of hay and the aroma of night-- of the flowers that were in bloom during the day but have closed up for now.  At the forefront of the aroma is a big plump prune, tawny port and possibly black pepper and tamari.  The initial flavor is moderately sweet and a barely detectable bitterness.  the flavor becomes startlingly balanced-- lightly sweet, acidic, and bitter.  the blast of flavor quickly recedes and the aftertaste is quite short.

Flavors were simply explosive in the mouth and were sweet malts, caramel, citrus like touches of oranges and grapefruits, grapes, tantalizing spices, berries and chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich.  Finish was great with just the slightest hoppy and dry bitterness.

Quite good... easy to see why it so highly rated... too bad it soooo expensive... well worth repeating!","Seymour, Tennessee, USA","VTHopHead"

12 oz bottle
Medium pour in a tulip glass
Best before 10/08, plucked 11/06

Poured a dark murky ruddy brown with a large light brown frothy mostly lasting head.

Smelt of whole wheat bread, raisins, cinnamon, molasses, dark fruit.

Taste was upfront moderate to strong, yet perfectly balanced bitter, sweet and sour, with raisins, coffee, roasted grain, bitter spruce, dark fleshy fruit, followed by a strong spicier and maltier taste, less sourness, notes of  good port or brandy, on an exquisite finish.  Palate was medium bodied, creamy and velvety, lively carbonated, and light to moderate astringency.

Overall, there is so much to enjoy in this beer, it deserves multiple sittings.  Classic.","Midland, MI, Michigan, USA","xav33"
2263,"2006-11-28",2.6,"Starts foaming out of the bottle as soon as its opened.  Pours a very dark, nearly opaque brown with a large, long-lasting, sudsy tan head.

Deep, expressive nose of mixed ripe and dried fruits, with some sweet malt, a whiff of nutmeg, and even some oxidative notes.

Carbonation level is high, giving the body fullness but also making it lively on the tongue.  Acetic acid also is there.  Flavor profile is a bit exotic, with grapy/berry fruitiness, spice, and molasses.  Thins out on the smooth and moderately brief finish.

Impressive in its own way, but the oxidative style and vinegar flavors just dont appeal to me.","USA","tcfishler"

2263,"2006-11-24",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2006 Well, I originally rated this beer based on a 2006 bottle.  I ran across a fluke pack of 2003 bottles at the beer store the other day, and Im back to tell you that its a much much different beer.  The aroma is unbelievable, smelling better than some of the good ports Ive tried.  The taste is no different, all the qualities of a really good port, and all the qualities of an excellent beer!  Strong notes of port (obviously) figs, dates, raisins, chocolate, espresso, maple syrup and molasses.  This beer in phenomenal if you leave it to age for at least 3 years.  -  What follows is the original review of the 2006 bottle  -  I tried this beer at Lot66 in Thunder Bay, and it was refreshing to see that someone in this city actually servers a proper beer! This beer pours jet black, with a nice head that fades away to nothing much too quickly. The aroma is very nice, and quite complex. I picked up a hint of sweetness with a little black licorice. I found the taste to be somewhat lacking, with a rather sharp initial attack, and a bit of a watery body and finish. To be honest, I very much preferred the Unibroue Maudite, which was smoother and had a better balance. I know all this sounds a bit negative, but it really was a superb beer overall. well worth a try, and Ill definitely be having this one again!","Ontario, CANADA","opc"

The aroma is mildly spicy with zest, pepper, anise, and a little bit of clove; there are some sweet brown sugar and caramel notes in there, too. The flavor is mostly raisiny malt and honey, augmented by very subtle rose petal and spruce notes. It works toward a spicy finish with cinnamon, anise, and corriander. It leaves a clean, sweet aftertaste and a warming sensation. As it comes to room temperature, more wood and caramel comes out. Very well balanced overall.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

Very fragrant stuff, full of sweet and ""ripe"" fruit aromas, with that recognizable Unibroue spiciness. That same quality shows up in the flavour, full of sweet dark fruit and some distinctive spiciness. The port/wine character that others (including the brewer) have described is right there in the finish, with a lasting pleasant sourness right at the end. Carries an swesome vinous character all the way through. Boom ! Its a masterpiece. Its a crime The Beer Store in Ontario has decided to de-list it.

My first sip is an explosion of fruity, spicy flavor with a slightly tart bite and some clove and vanilla overtones.  The force is strong with this one...

2263,"2006-10-02",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2016 Bottle was an enormous gusher, probably lost about half of its contents, but at least the room will smell nice for a while.  Hazy deep-red beer that shines brown, loud and fizzy beige head.  Too strongly carbonated.  Smells of thick malt, belgian yeast, dark pitted fruit, raisins, light oranges, sweetish but restrained.  Taste is layered and complex ... nuanced flavors.  Full-bodied and roughly the consistency of port.  Far from sludgy.  Light, pleasant alcohol felt more through numbing than burning, but the latter could do with some calming.  Yes, rather vinous texture.  Sweetness is here but slight, and just slightly stronger than the balancing bitterness.  Beautiful dark fruitiness and elegant maltiness.  A subtle beer rather than a powerhouse.  The classy adult entertainment for the evening. [2006.10.02: 3.9]Bottle BB 12-18-18, but here two years earlier.  Screw-top under foil, which is annoying, but at least no gushing this time.  Nose sweet caramel and thin but potent overripe red fruit.  Pour is chestnut that collects to a deeper mahogany with bits of ruby around the bottom, airy overall with a foamy cola-like tan head.  Taste alcohol and jammy, moderately dry, mild fusels that arent bad, strong orange and cherry, subtle raspberry, darker plummy notes and gentle waves of roast.  Pleasantly tart (indeed, that is the unmistakable identifier and hidden strength of this yeast; its thinness is the drawback) with mild spice, presumably from the hops, but who knows, could be coriander and black pepper.  This one tastes a little too fresh, as if time would help with the melding, and perhaps a little pressure release?  It does approach a porto in the fruity sense but not in sweetness or (obviously) strength, but Id still like to a see a denser, less fizzy version for a better comparison.

2263,"2006-09-28",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2007 After a year of aging... Deep, dark maroon and murky with a huge, light tan, fizzy but pillowy head which has decent longevity and minimal lacing.  Nose is very fragrant!  Fruity esters dominate with plenty of port notes.  Fruits noted include currant, fig, plum, grapes, and backing notes of spices including clove, nutmeg, and allspice; estery yeast presence with miscellaneous anise notes.  Flavor is nice and similar to the nose; currants, plums, raisins, and lots of figs some nice chocolate notes and hints at coffee.  Alcohol is noted when young, but just adding the port similarities; aging settles it a bit.  Sweetness is quite high with little notes to balance, but not necessarily unpleasantly.  Palate is medium to full bodied with a nearly lively bit of carbonation and a round, silky mouthfeel.  Finishes still sweet like a port, like the bottle suggests, with lingering ripe fruits, yeast, and chocolate flavors.  A very vinous and port-like Belgian with plenty of great fruit flavors.  Unlike any other BSA Ive tried but certainly among my favorites; unbalanced and tilted towards the malty, estery notes.  A year of aging helped the palate and possibly some fruit flavors (if that was possible), but still a great experience nonetheless.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

2263,"2006-09-28",3.5,"Another gift from my cousin to try. Very complex rigth from the start with a sweet aroma of fruit (maybe cherries) and caramel. Pours a deep red with tan head and A LOT of carbonation bubbles. Taste was somewhat hidden behind the carbonation bubbles, but taste of malts, fruit, and some spices comes through.

2263,"2006-09-21",3.9,"Sampled from Bomber as pictured. Appearance was a murky dark reddish brown liquid that you could barely see through if held to light.  Lots of carbonation and a two finger fizzy head that behaved almost like soda. No lacing was apparant.  Flavorwise,  If I were blind folded, I would have sworn I was drinking a hefeweizen with diet grape faygo mixed in it. Dont get me wrong, in this case that isnt a bad thing. Those flavors actually worked for me.  Theres a big hefe robust clove spice that is the initial taste. Big pop like fiz on the tongue combined with light mouthfeel.  The 9% ABV is hidden VERY well, I really couldnt detect until it was too late. (if you know what I mean!)  Aftertaste was definitly like a grape wine or porter.

Some slow-rising carb in the visible body. Big dark fruit nose with some sour tartness and even a little bit of the good wild Belgian horse blanket funk. Big, dark, assertive fruit attack with cleansing bubbles and a nice hollow fruit-pith finish. Clean hollow nothing once the beers gone down the zero.

Theres only a bare hint of fruit in the aroma; smells slightly like wine, or oddly enough, grape soda.  The taste starts quick with a malty-fruit explosion of grape with the mid-taste being slighly less intense but full of banana esters and a bit of melon.  The finish is earthier  and the aftertaste is that of almonds.  The palate is very silky, with a perfect amount of mouthfizz. That slight warm presence of alcohol is every easy on the stomach.

Pours a velvet black/red with a thick, rich head that never fully disappeared.  Complex aroma of raisins and cherries alongside your pick of alcohol or cough medicine; but in a good way.  Taste is also heavy on the complexity, and that makes this a journey worth traveling.  Hits dry as dry can be, melts into a tingle as it goes down.  More cherries, but raisins turn to grapes with an interesting blend of spices.  Port wine style tones with prevalent alcohol, but well hidden for a 9% brew.

There is a slightly sour take on the fruits, as the hops are well-hidden.

Not as complex as I hoped, but still lovely... (Edit: Wrong temperature definitely... as this warmed down, it got a lot more complex, with notes of prosecco, grapes, sugar, an alcohol). The taste... Agrumes again, spices (coriander), some apricot on the edges, with a....flat maltiness (dont know how to express myself better..wood? Nah.), and maybe some raisins. A touch acidic. No trace of alcohol at first, but it develops  in the end. Feels like it should be having one more dimension, one that got lost somewhere. Didnt impress me as much as I hoped it would.

Flavors are just as deep and enjoyable.  A sweetness shines through and blends with the fruit flavors to create candied cherries, strawberries, and plums.

The line between pretentiousness and genius is razor thin, you see, and I can already tell that this beer is going to be either a work of art or pure wankery. 

Deep purple, very fizzy with a small head that goes away quickly. This is a strange, very pretty plum color.

Complex and welcoming smell. Fruity esters somewhere between tart apricots and mellow grapes. Cloves make their way in there, as well.

What a pop of flavor upfront! A mad rush of sweet and sour fruit balanced out with a bland sweetness. The finish is clean--almost too clean. Nice and dry, but the flavor doesnt linger at all. Still, this is a damn fine taste and, surprisingly enough, theres almost no trace of alcohol. 

Very fizzy, goes down nice.

This is one of those dark, wonderful ales that you should surprise guests with by serving at a party in lieu of wine. It would go great with red meat.

2263,"2006-05-06",3.8,"From a 12 oz bottle.

Pours dark with a vigorous head; the aroma is dates and dark caramel and wood with a hint of yeast and mulling spices. 

Frankly, I dont understand the full magnitude of the hype surrounding this beer. Its a very nice beer, I agree, but comparing this head to head with other dark belgian ales I dont pick up nearly the complexity that some describe in this particullar attempt at the style. 

Instead, weve got a relatively sweet, relatively smooth-drinking dark Belgian ale; the flavor is dried fruits and the molassay part of molassas (as opposed to the sweet part of molassas) coming in relatively late in the flavor profile. Again compared with other dark Belgian ales of comparable strength, the alcohol is hidden as if by alchemy. 

This is a perfectly nice beer, and a very drinkable beer, but for me it falls just  short of the stand-out reputation that goes before it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Poured dark amber/brown.  Looks intriguing.  Strong alcohol and malts (and roasted fruit?!) in the nose.  Unique and strong taste which somehow reminded me of barleywine.  Which I cant figure out if I like or not.  Strong palate, odd flavor.  Intriguing yet repelling at the same time.  Kind of like a car crash.

The last Unibroue bottle in the fridge - having worked my way through I decided to save the best for last.  Three sniffs revealed three facets - first peppers and spice, then chocolate and licorice, ending with hints of apples and pears.  The opaque caramel colored body had a slight head that soon dissapated.  My first impression upon taking a sip was of chocolate dipped bananas blended with caramel dipped Granny Smith apples.  Extremely full bodied, later sips reminded me of the spicy heritage of most Unibroue beers.  I was detecting a distinct peppery taste.  Fortunately it soon faded leaving behind just a weak reminder of the experience.

2263,"2005-11-17",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2007 Ancient Chinese civilization has at its core a geometric design that defines itself and the world around it.  The dome of the sky is the heaven under which the square of the earth resides, and on each side of the square is a color and a direction symbolizing the people who live there and the terrain they live in.  There are four pillars then, which define this square of the Earth.  Id like to take a different approach, maybe even propose a historical hypothesis.  The beer making world follows the same guidelines.  There are civilized breweries, and there are barbarian ones.  The civilized ones reside in the center of the square of the Earth, and at its apogee is Unibroue.  Upon four pillars sits this magisterial brewing company; four columns of their own design that lend strength to their claim to sophisticated hegemony.  I have seen, and drank, them all: Maudite, Don de Dieu, Fin du Monde, and finally Trois Pistoles.  This last one is, I believe, their finest work, no doubt honed from the labor they put into the other three.  It is the most curious of them all as the one without form.  A quiet, pensive beer living in haughty solitude, and one who developed its character from an eccentric existence.  What is there in this beer that pushes Unibroue to the apex of beer crafting?  
	When I look at this beer I think of that mysterious sage in the public park, an eremite and an introvert, but seemingly bursting with wisdom.  The Trois Pistole fulfills this characterization with a very dark color which, when put up against a light produces a light brown halo on the top of the beer.  The foam is a modest light brown that fades away after proper admiration.  The smell is of earthy vegetables, with an apple and banana sidekick.  You can also tell by the aroma alone how smooth and creamy the beer will be.  I also picked up some asparagus in the odor, alongside a slight scent of cinnamon, a pinch of licorice and a good slathering of sweet-salty sauce (teriyaki).  The beer, though by appearance a laconic philosopher, has some bite.  The carbonation and 9% alcohol serve to give your tongue a little chastising, but nothing that doesnt contribute to the wonderful taste.  Above all, Trois Pistole is creamy, with a long, mellow aftertaste.  The cling of this beer forces you to take breaks between sips, to recover your breath, recollect your mind and go in again for another exhausting sip.  It deserves its reputation, and it deserves praise as the strongest of four well crafted beers that Unibroue has been kind enough to hand down from its lofty throne.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

[BOT341ml/2004-6m/12,4c] 
The opening: Dark ruby-brown color with a fine slightly brown-tainted head. The complexity to the nose is consistent with the quadrupel style. Therefore, we find the typical malted dominance: roasty, caramel, toast. But moreover, we find deep fruits as well. And of corse, that Unibroue yeast.
   
The contact: I wish I just could forget everything I know about this beer and taste it for the first time over and over again. The nose was right: It taste malty. There are spices...  Licorice, prunes.. Would that be cloves?  Then you feel the alcohol. Long.

2263,"2005-11-07",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2007 Porter-like appearance with a spritzy, tan head that quickly fades.  The nose is dominated by malt sweetness, noting figgish sugars above wet wood and earthiness.  A light yeasty fruitiness helps to tie it all together.  More sweet fig dominates the complex body, which moves to a more smokey profile towards the finish.  I love the subdued yeast Unibroue uses, giving their beers a distinct Belgian fruitiness, but keeping it soft and in the background.  Plain and simple, this is a meal of a beer that  just doesnt seem fit being served in twist-off bottles.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

On pure beer quality alone I would probably have given this a 3.8 but I had to give it a bonus point for those reasons... 

Aroma is very vineous, fruity, lots of plum, dark grape, some spiciness as it warms. Pours with a big, aggresive head, that unfortunately fades fast. Color is a very deep, dark brown, though certainly not black. At first the taste seemed pretty uncomplex and boring (though nice full palate), though as it warms much more is coming out.  Rich, dark malts, slight fruitiness, caramel, good belgian spiciness (pepper, allspice maybe?). Also takes on some nice yeastiness as the last remnants of the bottle pour.

Pours a deep chocolate black, with a thin whispy head that quickly disapates. Aroma is of dry black plumb with a little sweet malt, yeast, some smoke, and just a TRACE of boose. Mouthfell is slightly thick and very silky, like a glass of 1/2 milk 1/2 cream. Taste is dominated by a sweet robust roasty malt, combined with a bubblegumish yeastyness, and a blend of plumbs and prunes. Undertones are very simple, {unusual for Unibroue, normaly there are levels upon levels of undertones in their beers} sweet bread, biscuit, dry grape, oak, anise, some milled spice, and I think I can taste some coconut. Aftertaste is sweet with a trace of burnt shugar, and a little floral hoppyness in the finish. Normaly I only like the B.S.As with a high bitter content, but this one is very mild and understated and thus quite   enjoyable for a person, like myself, who is not a perticular fan of  Belgian beer.

Original review:
Fascinating aroma.  Smells of fruit, but not fruity, if that makes any sense.  Taste is very unique, and other reviewers are accurate when they say that it tastes of port.  Mouthfeel is excellent.  Just the right amount of carbonation, not so fizzy as to distract from the flavour.  More than Guinness, less than most lagers.  You have to be careful drinking this one: it has a 9% alcohol content, but (if anything), the alcohol is less noticable than in your run-of-the-mill macrobrews, as its overpowered by the flavour.","Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","Illuminatus"

I compare it with copenhagen snuff, which for me isnt unpleasant. ... Overall a very unique beer that I enjoyed a bit, but probably wouldnt buy again.

2263,"2005-10-07",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2006 The graphic design of Unibroues bottle must be mentioned. For the visually inclined they are a pleasure. 

This beer is a superb and luxurious experience. The aroma is intoxicating and transcendent even before the first sip. The nectar of the gods could not exceed it by much, pleasure greater than this would be illegal.

It explodes in the mouth like a low voltage rush, filling the pores with an electrifying yet warm surge of mellow flavor. There are shades of Port, but a distinct and original flavor unlike any other. 

The aftertaste is thin and does not linger, like the fleeting sensation of a drug-induced heightened awareness that makes no sense on return to normal  consciousness.

The head effect is light and ethereal, an easily controlled giddiness, a sensation worth the price of admission.

Rerate 4/06. I just bought a 12 oz. bottle. What a huge difference. I wouldnt give it more than a 3.2.   a huge dissapointment.

How could a beer be so different by being put in a smaller bottle? It makes no sense, yet it is a fact. ONLY buy the 22 oz bottle or bigger.

Chocolate, cloves, pepper and figs invigorate while a wrap-around fruity nature comprised of plums and chocolate covered strawberries pull at the heart strings.  Some cherry pipe tobacco and a spicy complex akin to Christmas (cranberries, orange peel and nutmeg.)  Effervescent, but not over the top.  Titillating on the palate.

Many fruity aromas intertwine to produce a blanced and complex nose. I noticed apples, apricots, cherries, figs, red wine, bread and a slight soapy undertone. The spices and above average carbonation intially hit the tongue but smoothen out to a velvety creaminess. Roasted malts shine as it slips across your tongue, reminding of caramel and dark chocolate. Definitely has some rich wine-like qualities and a long dry finish. Some bitterness lingers for a while. Leaves a very satisfying and warming feeling.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

2263,"2005-07-21",2.8,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2006 Re-rate:- I was hoping for this to get better but it just got worse. The second try was just a fizzy, thin, sherbet candi and artificial fruit flavoured mess that did not sit well on the palate. Poured a clear deep brown and this time lacked a head completely. Zesty, candi fruit nose with a light hint of alcohol spice. Utterly woeful as a Strong ale in the mouth, sat firmly amongst Mountain Dew and Pepsi as far as fizzy drinks were concerned. I cant see the follow the leader mentality of this one. At 860, it still reads 99 on the overall. Just not good at all.(345ml, BBE 07/06)  
Really cannot see the fuss made about this one. Expected a lot more, as the ratings suggest, of this high scorer. Poured into a chalice, cool but not cold, head formed and died back quickly to a short off-white lather that left a lovely amount of lace. The body of beer a deep ruby-brown with a lot of yeast that sunk quickly to the base. Initial strong, fruity, plum and cherry nose, quite spicy and sweet. Almost port-like and slightly musty, the aroma lapsed after the first sip to reveal nothing more than yeast and alcohol spice that remained for the length. Lighter than expected body, the harsh persistent carbonation bit at my tongue and obscured things. Very dry overall, vinous red wine flavours with dried fruits, earthy malt and yeast. Finish is quite long and dry, border-lining on astringent. Overall it wouldnt have been that bad a drop if the harsh carbonation didnt rip threads from my already dehydrated palate. Not the best offering from Unibroue, but I may give it another try, to be fair!!! (bottle 02/07)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

2263,"2005-06-27",3.7,"750ml bottle poured out a murky, rust-colored body under a tight, small head that fizzed away quickly... an appearance that I rated a 4 until I took into account the cork and caged bottle labeled with Rennaisance-quality, metaphoric oils through which Unibroue continually pushes the boundaries in a field dominated by mediocre typography, faux heraldry, saturated logotypes and cheapish landscapes. Aromas held some potency with musty prunes, licorice and spices. Flavor held a dominant fruity-sweetness that lingered for a long while through a semi-syrupy, rich palate. Despite the alcohol presence, it was not as overbearing as others in the Belgian Strong style. I will buy this again as my wife will enjoy it as well.

2263,"2005-06-21",3.7,"12oz bottle: Leather brown that is somewhat of a cloudy dark appearance. A fizzy head was created, but before i could take a sip it had died out.  Very hard for me to pick up any aroma in this beer, but i can smell few minor things such as rotten apple and some sort of spice. The flavor is of sweet malt, nutmeg, candy sugar, raisin, green apple, and a note of plum as well.  I think Unibroue beers are way over rated and not impressing  at all. Thats the main reason i bought a 12oz instead of the bigger $8 bottle because i didnt want to get stuck with another beer i hated from them.  However, i found this attempt at a Belgian strong style to be a chewy and pungent drink, holding a consistent sweet and sour tartness to it that i liked enough to give it the points i did.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

Aromas are of macerated dried fruits. Plums soaked in fine brandy comes to mind. Sweet, earthy malts and hops blend well. It must be from the extended aging that really pulls this beer together.

Re-Rate on a full bottle.  Much better take on the aroma, in which I noted prunes, dark dried fruit (like cheeries) and some alcohol.  Very enjoyable.  I wont change my flavor notes, but I will add prune, raison, spice, and red licorish.

Rich, vinous character with a warm alcohol bite but no real flavor of alcohol.  Sweet in the mouth but without any lingering sweetness that would make it overpowering.  Wonderful fruity flavors coupled with dried fruit flavors, like prunes or raisins, and some caramel or toffee notes.  Aftertaste definitely reminds me of raisins.

Medium-bodied, creamy but arguably over-carbonated. Fizzes on the tongue. Flavourwise, the port comparison in the description is valid. Its intense, with sweet cherries and merlot-like notes to the fore. The finish is dry, with lots of lingering fruit. Its an excellent strong ale but I find the alcohol a fraction too prominent.

The aroma is splendid with cherries, caramel, toffee and pit fruits.  Completely, the scent reminds me of a black cherry tootsie pop.  Taste is bold, full with flavors, but too sweet in its ending, and that detracts from it a tad.  However, core flavors are solid and succulent: pit fruit, plums, black cherries, figs, toffee, hints of cocoa.  Mouthfeel is full, with seemingly every liquid particle possessing a carbonated pop. Roll it around your cheeks and youll know what Im talking about.  Dusty, musty basement spices, typical of Belgians, lurks about the palate.  Alcohol bites but is not overly sharp.

It had a large, foamy head standing tall over a cloudy, dark brown beer with tiny bubbles rising through it. It had a sour fruit aroma, a sweet fruity taste with a dry mouth feel. There was a lingering taste of fruit that seemed kind of light, missing a hop finish. Although the big head dissipated quickly, there was a quarter inch left in the bottom of the glass.

A nice big, quickly dissipating, off-white head that leaves pleanty of lacing.  Color is dark brown with a tint of red.  The flavor is oh so smooth.

Sweet fruity plum/raisin/date/banana flavors with a little alcohol and roasted malt bite bringing it to a fairly quick and dry finish. Warming on the way down. Lively carbonation. The alcohol seems to bring out the spiciness from the yeast.  Not real heavy in the mouth, but by no means a quick drinker.

Being that Im an arrogant and demanding hop fiend with a hankering for certain West Coast brews, I wasnt too impressed.  Ive also become more acutely aware of the gradations going in amongst Belgian-style ales.  Les Trappistes seem to have perfected the style, mixing in nice malty background and respectable hop character and a frothy mouthfeel.  This is down a level in distinctness, and even presents watery mouthfeel.  More pronounced alchol character.  Id place this in the same arena as Chimay Bleu as I recall it, which I rated a 3.8 many years back.  This is above 7/10 quality, but not quite 8.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

2263,"2005-01-05",4.1,"Bottle.  One of my contributions to the 2004 beer exchange.  Pours a cloudy dark cherry amber with a huge head that never, never leaves.  Nose is like lots of these multi-fermented belgian styles as it has a sharp sourness that complements a sweet undertone.  Aroma also has a tart fruity quality... I like the nose a lot.  Immediate impression on flavor was the alcohol content, which sort of surprised me.  Nice spicy sweetness that gives way to that tartness that emerged in the aroma... I wish that I could dissect all of the tastes in this one.  Some sweet cookie dough and nice tart apples along with a great ending yeasty bite.  Fabulous feel in the mouth with a little less than full body, but perfect carbonation with both small and large bubbles rising in the palate.  Just a damn fine brew by Unibroue.  Another great story on the label as well.  Something about these French and their obsession with Lucifer...","Sligo","pjk33"

Highly carbonated and effervescent, with a much lighter body than expected.  9% ABV not evident until later.  Pretty dissapointed with this one - maybe got a bad four-pack.

Flavors remind of a dubbel that has been reduced over a stove...deep and malty, its too complex for my amature palate to understand.  Has some recognizable Unibroue characteristics.

2263,"2004-10-17",3.1,"Someone on this site (I forget who) told me a while back that Unibroue was seriously overrated and generally far too sweet. At the time I didnt believe them because my experience a few years ago, especially with La Fin Du Monde, was particularly good. Im beginning to believe them now. Its not that this is a bad beer (though Eau Benite was pushing it) theres just no way it deserves top 100 status. I didnt find it too sweet though...  Looks quite transparent in the bottle and when pouring, but is completely opaque in my Duvel tulip. Decent thin smooth head. This actually smells really good - vaguely reminiscent of Rochefort 8 with the gingerbread dough and allspice, quite a bit of toasted sugar, cinnamon and a bit of egg nog. The aroma really sets you up for a big letdown in the flavour stakes. Its really watery and thin, with a faint malted milk flavour and little else. No discernable alcohol, though I wouldve appreciated anything to make it more interesting! No dark malt character in flavour or aroma and no hop character. Its really quite stunning how little flavour they manage to pack in a 9% beer. Thanks to ol_juntan for lugging this across the country for me!

It was very refreshing overall.  My only complaint would be with the sweet character, which could have been toned down.  In its strongish moments, it almost reminded me of iced tea.

My homebrew club, <a href=http://www.bossbeer.org target=blank>BOSS, volunteers to pour the ""good"" beers, in return, we get to keep the leftovers for our picnic the following weekend (the village buys the beer, and their license is only good for the three days.

So after all that...
Pours a lovely brown. By this time, the head is kicking up pretty frothily, understandably. Has a great taste that to me gave just a light impression of cherries, more from the yeast character. Also a well-balanced spiciness that stays in the background for support. Overall great malty taste. This probably wasnt the best condition for trying it out in, but it held up very well.

Fantastic spark on the tongue, and a wonderful sweetness that follows after the drizzling of hops. Transendant complexity, utterly other-worldly, and overjoyous.

The aroma is more subtle than that of an IPA or Imperial Stout, but its there.  I can smell alcohol, pepper, clove, banana, and alcohol.  Had this beer at first almost fridge temperature....this beer is obviously not meant to be enjoyed cold.  It needs to warm up to almost room temp. before it starts getting really good.  Once mildly chilled however, the flavors come out.  This beer has its share of variety, leather, pepper, clove, carrot, melons, cherries, alcohol, and aged cheese.

The taste is what makes this beer. Wonderful fruity and spicy notes throughout with a light vinous nature. Mild bitterness and a touch of acidity provides depth and balance. Nice raisiny and mocha undertones too. The mouthfeel is lively and dangerously refreshing for the style and ABV (which is very well hidden). Started questionable but finished with a bang!

Dark brown appearance, fizzier than I was expecting.  Marvelous aroma of peaches and apricots that reminds me of a massage oil that used to be produced by Crabtree & Evelyn.  No comment as to the use of the massage oil.  Flavor is slightly of alcohol, but is dominated by a lush malt complemented by a myriad of fruit flavors.  A beautiful beer.

The aroma is dominated by concentrated fruit aromas (cherry, fig, and raisin).  There is a hint of alcohol and notes of spice cake also found in the nose. This is fairly light bodied given the intense fruit aromas that are in the aroma.  The alcohol is evident in the light burn as it reaches my stomach.  There is a hint of coriander in the finish.  The fruit notes of raisin and fig are here in the taste as well, but they are not as intense as the aroma would suggest.  The finish is fairly dry, though it is lightly sweet up front, which helps to accentuate the fruit notes.  Definitely an elegant brew, pretty subtle and I can imagine that some age brings some added complexity to this brew.  Ill have to stash a few to see how they age.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I haven't had port, but after all the comparisons in the reviews, I will be tempted to buy a bottle and try it out.  Fairly rich but overly carbonated.

The cherry, prune and raisin flavors come together very, very well. This is one of the sweetest beer I have ever had (and I usualy HATE sweet beers) but damn, this is good.  I just can't get over the great flavor of this Ale! The finish is very full, thick, and lingers for awhile. The mouthfell  is very unique in that it is very thick at first, then melts away and leaves your mouth feeling like velvet.

I loved the first time I had it, then the second and third time I thought it was disgusting.  So now, my &quotreal&quot rating.  Dark brown color with a large head.  Light aroma of coriander and stronger yeast.  Dark and sweet malt flavor.  The coriander is light and just supports the flavor, not overwhelming it.  Some Belgian yeast and some chocolate.  I think the main culprit is the coriander.  Im not a huge fan of it, but sometimes this one seems to turn into a coriander smoothie.  Other times (like this one), its just perfectly balanced out.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

2263,"2004-04-02",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2004 Bam!
Incredible!
Pours a deep chestnut coloured body with a thick and seemilgly everlasting caramel coloured head. I can already tell this is going to be good! Aromas are fruity...apples come to mind. Taste is of apples, almost like a cider, but with a hint of malty sweetness that compliments the fruit very well. This beer is seems to be like a thick cider. Smooth from start to finish with not a hint of the 9% alcohol. Very well made, and very tasty. Unibroue is certainly consistant when it comes to making incredible beers.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
2263,"2004-04-01",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2008 Pours a deep transparent amber.  Nice looking brew.  A really great fruity, yeasty aroma.  The flavor is subtle and elegant with lots of yeast and malty fruits.  The 9% was not detectable at all.  Unfortunately I find the palate to be a touch watery and thin, and with a little more body this would be a lot better.  Darn good anyway.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"
2263,"2004-03-30",4.5,"This is my 5th sampling from Unibroue where a friend cracked a bottle that had been cellared more than 2 years and they seem consistant in offering great gourmet Belgium beers that bottle age well and improve. 

Trois Pistoles weighs in at 9% alcohol and creates a very warming effect that is best appreciated on cold winter nights  or wild game dinners. However the alcohol is much better hidden in aged samples. It pours a such a dark ebony color from the whacking big roasted malt. Its rich, smooth with real texture, and the presence of the yeast used for in-bottle fermentation gives it a taste and aroma of spiced fruits and an after taste not unlike a  sweet medeira. I love this stuff I can hardly wait till some of the bottles I put down are ready.

Poured a black color that refuses to let light through the glass with coffee colored head and medium carbonation. Delicious aromas of fruits and spices. Starts very thick and builds to a wondrous full body punctuated with fruit and nut and chocolate tastes then finishes with warmth and a lingering wine like taste","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

2263,"2004-03-26",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2006 This is a masterpiece and a dangerous beer at the same time.  Ridiculously mellow for a 9% beer.  Malty, dark and delicious.

RERATED: A beauty of an ale - dark, mysterious and emitting a spicy/fruit aroma that really whets the appetite. Very tasty, reminiscent of a sweet red wine.  But wheras nobody with any taste likes their wine sweet, it works nicely in this context.

Some points are lost for the too heavy carbonation.  But make no mistake, this is a really good brew, and its heavy alcohol content sneaks up very nicely.","Ontario, CANADA","Beer Snob"
2263,"2004-03-24",4.2,"Nice 2 finger head disipates quickly to a nice lace. Color of caramel and slight amber hue. Smells a bit fruity, bits of berries, medium malt on the nose. The taste: fruity top, with hints of apple, pears and berries. ALso hints of nutmeg and cinnamon in the middle, resembling a spicy, oaky apple pie. Good bitter tingle. Mouthfeel was perky, not so creamy. This is a remarkable Belgian-Style with a twist. I love its originality, mellow, light bodied. Complex spicy tones gives this a trememdously versatile drinkability. Awesome outing from these devilish Canadians, brilliant,complex with a touch of class.","Long Beach, California, USA","zen"

2263,"2004-03-15",3.9,"Beautiful dark bubbly appearance.  Smooth dark cherry taste.  Not as many dimensions imo as la terrible.  This was enjoyable but not as transporting as I expect from a belgian strong.  This style of beer has enormous potential for complexity and this did not deliver.

2263,"2004-03-14",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2005 Short lasting, thick head covered an amazing, deep brown (like dark cider) ale. When held to light beer had many floaties and only let light in at the edges. Nose of spice, yeast, and apple cider. The taste is very grape and wine like.  Complex beer. The finish is very yeasty and bread like, a big change from the first sip. Alcohol is decently hidden, but it still warms the mouth.  One 12oz can hit ya.

Medium-full body with moderate carbonation.  Restrained sweetness with a vinous quality and notes of currants and similar fruits.  There is some sourness/acidity in the middle that leads into a lingering, spicy finish.  My own preference is for young bottles in which the fruity flavours are full, juicy, and centre-stage.  Aged bottles are slightly less appealing to my tastes.  Quite enjoyable.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Wheatsheaf"

Smells of raisins, dark toasty malt, and a hint of fruity yeastiness as well as some obvious clove scent.  A decent tan-coloured head, although I've noticed that this varies substantially from bottle to bottle.  Taste is very complex, starting out with a rich fruity peach/apricot.

Pours a murky redish brown with a huge head but very little lacing.

Smells very fruity; bananas are the most obvious scent with cloves hanging around.

Tastes like ripe fruit. Again, bananas and cloves, but there's some toffee in there as well. It's very complex and spicy; I'm wishing I had a book of adjectives right now. This tastes really good.

Mouthfeel is full. I was expecting it to be overly carbonated after pouring it, but it's not. Drinkability suffers only from the high alcohol content, although I really can't taste the alcohol.

Pours very dark mostly opaque ruby with a large off white head that diminished to leave a respectable covering. Aroma is a sweet fruitiness with firey alcohol notes hiding beneath it and slight hints of spice and yeast as well. The flavour is big vinuous fruit and malt with some spice and a pleast hint of licorice or anise at times. Did not like this one the first time I had it... oh how wrong I was. Combination of a friends birthday and a brewers banquet made me take another look at this one.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

I'm also partial as Unibroue is one of my favorite brewers.  As the label accurately states this is a mellow dark ale that lingers like a port wine!  The 9% ABV is subtle and suprising.

Big apple aroma at the beginning sloping down into some malt and some hops. Very nice.  Flavor reflects the aromas. Ripe fruit (apple and pear) start out this enjoyable beer, leading into a bit of a bready/yeast flavor. The body is slightly carbonated with a musky finish, but that's not the right word I'm looking for.

The taste of this beer is superb again; chocolate malts, sweet roasted, fruity and honey. Very well balanced. Lingering and very smooth palate, perhaps a little bit alcoholic (the only small minus of this brew). Overall a great beer.

Initiailly sweet, but later on bittersweet flavor, aged but still balanced. Relatively thin mouthfeel. Lasting bittersweet finish.

Yes, this is pretty good.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

The pour is beautiful, a dark extremely cloudy barleywine - esque appearance.  Very little lacing, with a strong aroma and a fizzy soda like head.  The taste that come out of each sip are so vastly different and complex.  Everything from dates and figs and raisins, to dark fruits to complement the darkness of the style.  Very winey, like a port, this would go nicely after dinner or on a cold winter night sitting around a fire.  Has the ability to warm you up and put a smile on your face.

It has hints of fruit in the taste and the carbonation is very apparent when drinking, but overall it reminds me of a really smooth wheat beer.  It is not excessively smooth to drink and it is pretty flavorfull.

The taste is complex: an adequate balance of chocolate, roasted caramel, cherries, grapes, spices, yeast (less than Unibroue's standard). A light alcohol (not quite well-hidden, but about what I expect from good belgians of this ABV) bitterness joins you until the end.

2263,"2003-07-06",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2006 Possibly my favorite belgian style ale.  What really sets this one apart for me, is the relative lack of astringency in comparison with other belgian strongs (there is still some present though).  Granted this is not a triple and should not be that prone, but this beer pours on the flavor all the way through.  It has a wonderful mix of raisin and plum and is pleasantly sweet.  There are even some woody/grape leafy notes and plenty of spice.  Texture is smooth and no hint of a grainy feel.  Body is full, which is always a plus, as I would hope one would like to taste their beer.  For 9abv, it does not overpower you with alcohol (and I dont see any taste resembling bactine).  Pours a deep black and has a yellow/off white head on it.  Aroma is a light plum wine, with some malty notes and not as much yeasty smell as I expected. Not as much of a strong yeast presence as I would expect, but I dont see that as a bad thing.  Flavor thins out a bit towards the finish, and there is a slight astringency that comes out after the sweet fruit notes in the middle that creates a tiny bit of inconsistency in the overall experience, maybe a touch too sweet.  Tough to critique this one though.  Rerate  Probably a 2004 bottle. Corked 750mL.  Upon removing the cork (which was very difficult), there was no pop, no nothing.  This beer was dead flat.  Now, Im not saying this beer should be at its best, when drunk uncarbonated, but among the best beers Ive tried, giving them time to sit out does not ruin the flavor, or body.  In fact, Im actually a fan of uncarbonated, or naturally carbonated (resulting in very low levels) beers.  This however was revolting.  Cheap, sweet, sugary candy.  I will reserve judgement (for the most part) until I can get another bottle that is carbonated, and let it sit out and naturally free itself of carbonation.  Will see how that tastes.Draught at Publick House 3/23/06.  Same frothy, well-retained head with lacing.  Lightly hazy appearance.  Dry, but not overly so, in the aroma and flavor with the dark fruit esters, spices, black pepper and clove.  Sweetnes as it warms, with candi-sugar residue on the palate and light vanilla.  A light amount of roast gives a little oomph.  I think my score is about right.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2263,"2003-07-06",4.5,"Extremely dark beer...cannot be drunk all the time, alcohol is immediately felt in the aroma and on the palate. Fruity, with notes of plums and a touch of chocolate on the aftertaste. Not a beer for novices, as the mouthfeel is quite astringent. Still, one of my favorite beers for its complexity and strength. I will have to re-rate this once I taste La Terrible.","CANADA","SilentNight"

Tons of heavy settling in the middle and tons of gluey lace in large patches and shelves, great consistency. 

Has a nice light citrusy dark aroma, spicy, with caramel and banana notes, some wet breadyness also noted.

Taste is subtle, layered in mellowing smoothness and dark, lots of dark fruits in front of banana, strawberry, raisins, a lemony sweetness but soft and dark as well, takes the stage leading to dark caramel, with hints of nuts and bread yeast and some small hops rounding out and bringing a firm but mellowing balance together. Nice texture thats a bit astringently soft yet complex in its lingering. Feel is full medium body, smooth and a bit creamy with that tingly effect late from the carbonation.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

There is a lot going on in the flavor department.  Multiple layers of flavor beginning with a light malt introduction, this is quickly followed by a deluge of yeast and spices.  Finally the brew finishes lightly acidic with a good dose of alcohol.  This is an ale to be savored.  Thank God for ales of this caliber which are easily accesible.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"

Thats right, the topical antiseptic available at most drug stores. If you don't believe me then go to your medicine cabinet and take a long pull of bactine then drink the Trios Pistoles. You will see that they taste the same. This beer is way overrated. Don't get me wrong:it's not bad. Just too sweet and fruity for me I guess along with the medicinal aftertaste.

Good overall fruity taste with definate roasty qualities and a carbonated aftertaste that leaves the mouth feeling coated well, but not overly so. This one is a very good sip, as you can take one sip and taste it for a while (the whole sentence above :-), but definately not overpowering. I would most likely compare this to (as one user wrote), Chimay Bleu, because of its maltiness. But, in contrast to that version of Chimay, this has a lighter taste and more carbonation and definately more of a subtle aftertaste. In addition, the alcohol is hidden well.

The head is foamy and of quite fine bubbles which leaves some really nice streaks of lace after each sip. Nose is lovely and fruity floral w/ a citrus note which might perhaps be from coriander or orange peel but may well be yeast or hops just the same. Texture is light medium bodied but lightened by a brisk cushion or carbonation. Its very nice and on par w/ the very best Belgians made anywhere in the world. The flavor follows the aroma quite exactly, the tartness and sweetness of the beer being perfectly in tune w/ what the nose presents. It has a surprising lightness w/ still being full flavored. Quite honestly, when I re-rate a beer which I rated highly many years ago, I generally expect my rating to drop quite significantly. This is not the case here. I appreciate this every bit as much and more as I did in my early days of beer tasting. This is a truly excellent beer.

Original rating 2003 (4.0 - 9, 3, 7, 3, 16): Dark, cloudy brown. Mostly diminishing head, some lace but not much. About the stongest vinous character Ive ever tasted in a beer. Tart aroma with a slight hint of wheaty malts. Mildly lemony citrus flavor, hints of plumbs and grapes. More sweetness comes out in the finish along with a slight hop bitterness. Lighter bodied than what I expected but it works absolutely perfectly with the flavor. Warm alcohol presence. A delicious change of pace from what Ive been drinking lately.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

A malty, sweet aroma, almost like wort.  The first sip on the palate explodes in texture, with a pleasing flavor and a smoky finish.  Excellent hops blend, none to thin or overdone.  The carbonation and texture of this beer really makes it explode in your mouth, and then dissapate like magic.  Wow, this is some complex beer.  No question as to it's place as a world class brew.

2263,"2003-02-09",3.7,"Signature Unibroue spicy, slightly fruity aroma. Pours a very dark brown, mid-range carbonation, and a frothy brown head. Spicy, alcohol taste. Well balanced; you appreciate it more if you experience it slowly. Is the finish smooth or is it lacking? The Maudite seemed to have more going on at the end. Still a good beer but not the best Unibroue.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","TipsyMcStager"
2263,"2003-02-09",4.1,"Hazy brown/amber color with light beige head. Initial fruit like aroma as notes of yeast, spices and alcohol subtly present themselves. A delight for the taste buds (albeit confusing), taste varies from sweet to tart, acidic to spicy. Becomes more complex as it warms, with tastes of raisins, spice, and a slight chocolate touch. High alcohol fairly well hidden with a gentle pinch of a reminder as it reaches the back of the throat. Ill get this again, and although I probably couldn't drink more than one in a sitting, I'll enjoy every bit of it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Superstar"
2263,"2003-02-06",4.2,"Reddish/brown/orange, quite opaqe, I like!  Very tiny bubbles, a tight, thick off white head.  Some smokey hints in there, or is that an oakiness? Yogurt raisins come to mind as well, on account of the vanilla and date/raisin notes. Some serious sweet caramely malts, some hints of milk chocolate as well. Alcohol and esters prevail the nose, along with ripe fruits as well.  Sweet taste and a somewhat dry finish, much like last night's cabernet.  Silky smooth and super soft but with an alcoholic tingle as well, quite a warming effect!!  This is a Belgian golden with ripe fruits and a greater barley character.  Maybe a half red wine, half golden ale thing.  Superior mouthfeel but could use a more complex finish. I could drink this stuff al day, every day.  That is if I didn't get hammered on account of it first.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"

Anyway, this beer pours a deep ruby color with a medium beige head. Aroma of cherry, vanilla, figs, and raisin. Fruity flavor of plum and raspberry, with a lightly chocolate malt finish. Very easy on the tongue, unlike a lot of Belgian Ales. Absolutely smooth and easy to drink. Very good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

The aroma is all over the place, with fruit, plums, yeast and although it sounds strange, a sweet tart candy smell.  Taste is excellent, with a variety of spices lingering in the mouth.

2263,"2003-01-20",4.6,"Some Belgian ales are overpowering.  Trois Pistoles takes all the complex flavors of the better Belgians and makes them far more subtle.  There are times I want the strongest flavors out there, but this is far more drinkable on a regular basis than many strong ales.  A wonderful brew to complement a meal, for instance, rather than stand out from it.  References on the bottle to port wine are referring to the complexity and subtlety of the flavors - not that it tastes like port.  More like a tawny port (more subtle and complex flavors) than a ruby (more obvious and overt flavors).  Will buy and drink often.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Rambis"

2263,"2003-01-18",2.3,"Definitely not one to remember that is for sure, and definitely not one to my tastes. Did i mention i dont like wine at all...and when i poured this..my first impression...yup...wine!!!. It poured a fiery red color with nice carbonation in the glass, with a minimal white head and a faint aroma of alcohol and wine...but nothing spectacular..a slight smell of dark fruit, but that was it!!! The taste is pretty repulsive on the tongue... over ripe plums batter the mouth in an acidic free for all, and leave a grapefruity dryness to all hell. Morbidly awful acidity level here that made my tongue curdle...sandpaper like almost. The roasted malt did come through more towards the aftertaste near the end of the bottle as the sudden shock of that horrid dark fruit (more like chewing on a grapefruit peel) faded. It took the malt base at the end here just for me to give this a half decent rating. I dont like wine and this was too reminiscent of wine..heavy on the alcohol, and heavy on the fruits...not my style, and no i dont think i will care to venture near this again.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Aroma of malt, hints of ripe fruit I like to say plums, sweet and quite a clean and fresh nose. Malt dominates the start, sweet and the top middling in feel, finish is stingingly acidic, hops robust and plentiful, quite dry aftertaste also long lasting. The high ABV makes this a fine winter warmer, and a good beer to sample on New Years Eve. Ranks #189 on my current 1000 beer master list.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

2263,"2002-12-13",4.5,"This might be one of my favorite beers of all time at this moment.  If its too cold, you cant get a lot out of this beer, but once it warms, you smell dark fruits (plums, at least I think), malt, alcohol, and a nice spicey cloviness.  Taste is sort of the same but you get some carmelly flavors along with all the other aromas.  Some yeastiness comes into the back ground if you shake the bottle too much when pouring, but its not necessarily a bad thing, it just adds to the complexity.  Alcohol is a back seat driver with this beer, but its voice is heard in aroma and taste, but very slightly.  Very well balanced for the amount of malt that should be in this beer.  Coloration is deep, deep, copper to dark brown w/ some very nice ruby highlights and a fantastic head to start but it gets knocked down by the alcohol.  Highly evervescent as a Belgian should be, its a nice change from the norm.  Too much of this could be a good thing, but may very well be a very bad thing.  FYI, this was a World Beer Cup Gold Medal winner for Belgian Strong Darks.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

It has a wonderful dark brownish red caramel look.  It poured with a nice thick bubbly head and it almost resembled champagne in its carbonation.  My only problem with this beer was over carbonation. Otherwise it was fantastic.   The aroma and taste reminded me of raspberry brandy, with a hidden cherry flavor as well.  I felt that the alcohol was dangerously hidden as it was a very easy beer to drink.","Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","ARMed"

Tastes great... More filling!! Nevermind that. Its a little on the sweet side for me, but very enjoyable nontheless. Moderately malty with hints of honey and a nice alcohol flavor.

Body is still thick and flavorful with nice sweet balance that continues to mask the alcohol very well.  This has aged quite nicely and gained some more complexity.

9/16/2002: Very dark and murky, but well carbonated.  Hints of fruit and oak in the nose.  Smells almost sour, but not noticeable in taste.  Coats and warms the throat on its way down.  Very little hop presence, but nicely rounded roasted malt mixture making it just sweet enough to mask the high alcohol content.  Only gets smoother as it warms.

I think that something about the graphics and the bottling sets me off.  So, it is with superb delight that I write this review.  The bottle opened with a champaign-like pop.  Surprisingly, some beer foam followed (I might have agitated this sucker during the car ride home.)  Alcohol was quite evident in the aroma, but I could sense fruit and malt hiding behind.  Now for the coup de gras, the flavor of this magnificent beer.  Fruit tones envelop the tastebuds as alcohol warms the tongue.  Wonderful malt complexity and the yeast go a long ways contributing a nice ester-y spiciness.  Overall, this is one of the best beers I have tried in the past year.  Thanks to Ratebeer for pointing me in this direction!","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"

Smells like a good belgian should. Not as spicy as some, but the estery fruitiness is good. Having trouble with some of the spicier belgians, this is a good beer to me.

8/12/03: The pour is the color of prune with a thin tan head. Aroma is of sweet, fruity malt and yeast. Complex flavor includes hints of cherry, grape, spices, yeast and a little port wine.

2263,"2002-07-10",3.4,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2015 Bottle (BB 12-03-16).

Head is initially average sized, frothy/fizzy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark amber/brown.

Aroma is lightly malty (cookie, toasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers, herbs), moderately yeasty (cobwebs, basement), with notes of date, cola, orange peel, clove, alcohol.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

As with many other Unibroue beers, the mouthfeel is the weakest link...a bit watery and fizzy. Nice yeast and fermentation effects though. The nose has some allure and the flavor balance is decent, so ultimately its still a mostly enjoyable Belgian styled brew.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Does share similar charactertistics with dark wine in the dry aftertaste, but thats not a bad thing.  The only neagative was that the carbonation was a bit on the extreme side, unfortunately.

Much bigger head than anticipated, very thick and creamy, though it didnt last too long.  The head fizzed and popped loudly enough to be very noticeable; it was sort of like putting your ear over a bowl of Rice Krispies.  Nice scent, lots of caramel and raisins.  Flavor is very aggressive, with large amounts of maltiness.  Plenty of fruit here, plums, apples, and raisins along with nuttiness and breadiness.  Finish has exceedingly strong alcohol--no attempt has been made to mask the 9% abv whatsoever.

2263,"2002-03-19",4.4,"This is a strong, dark ale that weighs in with a 9% alcohol-by-volume rating. It is a living beer, undergoing refermentation (secondary fermentation) in the bottle. It pours with a dark brown color and a very thin foam head that disappears very quickly. This ale is brewed with a roasted malt, which explains its dark color and its slightly nutty (hazelnut) aroma. This ale also features dark fruit aromas, plum in particular, and some have likened the smell to a fine glass of Port (fortified wine from Portugal or Spain). 

In flavor, this ale has a lively mouthfeel and is surprisingly light for such a high-alcohol beer. The texture is smooth and the flavor is fruity and round, turning slightly sweet at mid-palate, and ending with a mild amount of warmth, a slight but of sourness, and a gentle amount of hop bitterness. This is a complex, structured ale featuring many different flavor experiences and a pleasing aftertaste that makes for very easy drinking.","Pico Rivera, California, USA","maxhits"

The color is dark amber and almost opaque, and the head is a nice tan color.  Wow...a bunch of tastes in there...fruit, spice, malt, a little carbonation too but not too much.  It is a little winey but not like a barley wine at all.  It is much smoother and more mellow than those.  It warms well on the way down too...9 percent in this case is a good thing!  The only fault I see, and its a small one, is the body...its a little heavy, syrupy at times, but even that I could get used to. If not for that, this would be my highest-rated beer.

The nose offers up a deep sweet roasted malty aroma, and a fruity mix of raisin and prunes. Signs of a sherry-like aroma remind me a little of an imperial stout. The first sip is something of a surprise. Having braced myself for something thick, it washes over very light and is a little too easy drinking. There’s a good fizziness on the palate as well as instant signs of alcohol which warn you to take things easy. Initial taste is certainly sweet with a roasted malt and a mixture of ripe fruits, bringing to mind cherry, cranberry and prune, with an underlying yeastiness throughout. Further tasting also revealed a little spiciness, while there’s some coffee-like dryness in the finish. The aftertaste is very warming rounding out very much like a port.

2263,"2000-10-30",4.4,"A rich, very complex Belgian. Dark ruby red in color emitting a sweet fruity aroma. Highly carbonated to style which accentuates its beautiful sweet, dark ripe fruit taste. Reminiscent of raisin, fig and black cherry with a hint of vanilla. Must be enjoyed at cellar temps to fully bring out its complexities. The higher alcohol level really warms it all up nicely. A genuine treat!","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

2263,"2000-08-07",4.4,"Impressive by any means.  This beer is dark, fairly fruity and very strong.  This is an amazing beer.  Unibroue struck gold here.","Old Town, Maine, USA","beerman991979"
