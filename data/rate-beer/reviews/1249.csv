Fuck you to your core, you idiots. Anyway, this bottle says 13%. Booze all over the aroma, from the beer and a little bit of bourbon, otherwise ashy, charred, dark roasted malts, day old weak coffee, and a touch of sourness. Big, boozy flavor, bourbon, charred, ashy fireplace wood, old bad coffee, caramel, cream, lingering acidity. Not good.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

1249,"2015-01-04",4.2,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 10/2014. Pours nearly opaque very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light tannic oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged doppelbock style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

1249,"2014-11-21",4.2,"12 oz. bottle shared by Willrunforbeers. Dark brown color with thin lasting head. Aroma is mild bourbon upfront with vanilla oak, with deep caramel and raisins. 
Wow... Pretty impressive brew. The flavor is a mellow bourbon, vanilla and mild oak enveloping a dark fruit and caramel lager. Kind of like drinking a bourbon soaked raisin dipped in sugar. The body is on the leaner side but its not an issue with the amount of flavor I am getting from all sensors on my tongue. The rich bourbon flavor is here without any heat. But the ABV does pack a punch to make you feel happy. Damn fine brew!!","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

1249,"2014-10-26",3.9,"12 oz bottle. Pours deep red brown with a tan head. Potent smooth bourbon aroma, woody molasses and vanilla.

Its pretty enjoyable.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"

1249,"2014-09-18",4.1,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, caramel, vanilla, raisin, light toasted coconut, and bourbon. It pours a dark brown with some significant red highlights. It has a one finger beige head that eventually fades to a thick soapy film. There is some drippy soapy webbing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate with touches of cocoa powder and light caramel. There is a touch of molasses and raisin in the middle. The finish has light-moderate vanilla, coconut, light bourbon, faint oak, and a hint of roasted malt. Its medium-full bodied with mild carbonation and a touch of stickiness in the mouthfeel. Overall, Id say flavor-wise its kind of an Imperial Stout/Doppelbock hybrid aged in bourbon barrels. It sounds like previous years batches were a little boozy and hot. This batch from 2014 isnt. I really dig it.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

Aroma is very barleywine-ish with prominent notes of caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon-y oak, & a splatter of chocolate in the back-end. Similar with the taste, even heavier bourbon barrel presence, perhaps because the base beer is rather light. Big time wood, pungent bourbon, sticky toffee, vanilla, cocoa powder, & some caramel. Hard to discern any lager qualities from this. Tastes more like a barleywine than anything, with quite a large barrel presence. Pretty nice, but my 4 oz sample was perfect - anymore may get palate fatiguing.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

1249,"2013-03-11",4.9,"Strong, lively bourbon smell mellowed by a malt backbone that is absent of sweetness.  The appearance is mild compared to the aroma and flavor; a dark brown with amber edges alongside the translucent evidence of a lager.  The flavor is immaculate.  Not nearly as cloying as, say, a BB impy stout, but the flavor holds up - indeed, you get more, but also gentle, bourbon on a delivery liquid that does nothing but compliment the overall flavor.   Bourbon, with a touch of spice, maintains into the palate, albeit softly.  Overall, Ive never drank anything with a strong bourbon flavor that is so easy to swish around the mouth, hold, contemplate, and enjoy.  Its lacking only in richness - per the style.  Its not what were used to - but I LOVE this beer!  Edit: as an afterthought realization - this beer doesnt have the sweetness often associated with big BB aged beers, per the respective styles - and I enjoy the resultant novelty immensely.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","gonzosauce"

1249,"2013-01-12",3.7,"12oz Bottle. Thanks Sean!! A very nice bourbon aroma, green with wood and rosy with booze. On the tongue, theres a nice crisp brown lager layered with tart bourbon oak. The barrel gets heavy and hot, putting the beer out of balance. It needs a little more sugar to hold up to the barrel, or a little less barrel, ideally. I love the flavors though. Everything is clean, from the base lager, which Wolverine does so well, to the fresh Bourbon on top. Nice carbonation keeps it lively and prickling. The finish is snappy with a nice crisp hoppiness, lingering bourbon woodiness, and a bit of roasted malt caramel. Great winter flavors.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1249,"2013-01-10",3.3,"Waxed 12 oz bottle and served in a snifter: Deep mahogany hue with some reddish hues, lasting frothy head and okay lace. The aroma has notes of caramel, toffee, roast, bread and plenty of bourbon barrel influences. Vanilla and oak vapours along with a dose of sour mash whiskey. The taste is sweet but enough booze and oak to sharpen the palate. Some raisin and pear fruit character along with a touch of earthy minerals. No hop presence noted nor much of any real malt depth. The mouth feel is warming but a tad flabby. This is where the barrel seemed to dominate, thin and boozy.  It is okay but somewhat disjointed. Just too much barrel influence for the base beer but then methinks the base beer is not all that great anyway.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

1249,"2012-11-01",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2013 Pours a clear dark brown color with slight ruby highlights.  Minimal head, minimal lacing.

And just like the aroma, there a nice toasted malt background.  Pretty thin body.  I was hoping for more body here considering its 10.5%.  Mouthfeel is a pretty sticky.  Good but not great bourbon beer.  I will lay down my last 4 of these to see what happens.  Re-rate 9/29/13 - Had this one a couple more times since my original rate and I like it more now.  Bourbon has faded a bit now making it more of a complement instead of the focus.  A nice sweetness has emerged too.
