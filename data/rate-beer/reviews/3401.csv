3401,"2017-04-27",4.3,"Aardnon jest blendem 30% Aardmonnik i 70% Pannepot Reserva (leżakowane w dębowych beczkach Château Margaux).
Piwo leżakowało 7 lat w beczkach.   
 Data butelkowania:  18.02.2016 
 Data ważności:  27.02.2021 
 Kolor:  Ciemnobrązowe, nieprzejrzyste. Początkowo wydaje się czarne. 
 Piana:  Jak na ten styl piana wydaje się obłędna. Ma ciemno kremowy kolor, zbitą i zwartą konsystencję. 
Sprawia wrażenie jednej, jednolitej masy.
Opada w dół powolutku. Pozostawia szereg wstęg na ściankach Sniftera. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest po prostu kosmiczny. Pierwsze przesłanki są kompletnie zaskakujące. Piwo jest wpisane w styl Sour Ale, a pachnie intensywną wanilia, karmelem, toffi. Pod spodem odrobina miodu.
Daleko w tle cierpkie, owocowe nuty. Coś jakby rabarbar posypywany cukrem.
Dla mnie bomba! 
 Smak: W smaku na maksa odjechane. Nie wiem czy jestem w stanie wyobrazić sobie jakiekolwiek piwo w podobnym stylu. 
Jest to mieszanka wielu stylów i światów.
Piwo na pierwszy rzut oka wydaje się słodkie, karmelowe z elementami ciemnych i czerwonych owoców (rabarbar, śliwka, wiśnie). Po prostu mix doskonały.
Po chwili staje się intensywnie kwaśne, owocowe z dominantami w postaci cierpkich owoców (czerwone i ciemne winogrona). 
Piwo ma gęstą teksturę, umiarkowane wysycenie.
Odczucie w ustach jest pełne.
Piwo rozpływa się dosłownie na podniebieniu.
Niesamowite doznanie! 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Teraz już wiem dlaczego mała butelka tego piwa kosztuje ponad 60 zł., a na rynku wtórnym ok. 100 ;)
Piwo jest po prostu odjechane w kosmos.

Dawno już nie piłem takiego ewenementu.
Trunek w aromacie nie daje żadnych przesłanek, że może to być kwaśne piwo.
Wprost przeciwnie jest mega słodkie, owocowe, karmelowe, a potem waniliowe.
Dopiero w smaku pokazuje swoje kwaśne oblicze, przełamane wyraźną słodyczą. 
Kompleksowe, doskonale beczkowa, nietuzinkowe piwo.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

De couleur ambrée versant sur le cuivre, le col est moyen oscillant entre moka et café au lait et léger beige.
Arôme présente un bouquet qui de suite annonce des effluves anglaises avec un Thomas Hardys qui nest pas en reste et fort complexe malgré son faible ajout par barrique. Retrouve un nez malté, grillé, un peu crystal, léger toffee, fruité noir avec un côté de prune et date. Le tout est finement aigrelet tout en modération.
Palais est plus axé sur le suret, côté de baies rouges avec un petit côté de cassis voire de groseille. Retrouve une certaine sécheresse anglaise au niveau malté tout en ayant une base de départ clairement plus Struise. Fort à pensé que la Pannepot a aussi évoluée depuis 2007 au niveau de sa finesse. Fini légèrement boisé avec un fruité noir qui passe un peu au dessus du noir. Le fini garde aussi un léger profil et caractère suret, funk avec un superbe fini grillé apportant une pointe de chaleur. A revisiter pour voir lévolution du caractère suret qui a des chances de pouvoir accentuer le profil aigrelet.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Tanned, thin, loosely structured and quickly dissolving head, colour mahogany - bronze; aroma stunningly complex, very fruity and earthy, maltiness with elegant sour notes, impressions of oak, dates, bitter chocolate, port wine, raisins, balsamic vinegar, medium dry sherry, dried leaves, coffee grounds, hazelnuts, passion fruit; taste equally complex, in fact one of the most complex ales I ever had the pleasure to taste, exotic fruit, deep and rich, multi-layered maltiness, a bit toasty, chocolatey, nutty, all drenched in a refreshing lactic acidity which is blended in perfectly, ending in a fascinatingly complex, long and dry aftertaste.
