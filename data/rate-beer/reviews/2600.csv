2600,"2015-10-10",3.7,"Bottle. Shared by bergstaden. An unclear, dark brown beer topped by a dense, finger-thick light beige head. Some lacing. The aroma is on the malty side, toffee and a faint earthy and fruity-sourish/berry-sourish and smoked hint. Tar, caramel, earth, cocoa hints, sourish fruityness and some smoke and berries in the flavor. Some alcohol warmth in the mouth, its full-bodied and semi-sweet. Lasting finish. Nice indeed, but far from easy drinkable. 151001","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

2600,"2013-01-23",4.0,"330ml botte from Slow Beer. Worth getting this beer just for the label never mind the beer. Yet another collaborative brew and this one pours a light back tea colour with a thinnish layer of tan foam. Spiced fruit aromas of prunes, raisins and plums are strong and invite you in to and take a drink. Big, bold and bad ass in the mouth with mouth numbing flavours and very lively on the palate. Aniseed is strong in the flavour and aftertaste.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
2600,"2012-12-26",4.1,"A dark brown saison pours with a small head. Smells  of some roasted action, chocolate and fruity farmhouse ale. Tastes like a farmhouse ale, with more medium cooked fruit through a roast/toast finish. Have had a few of these now.","Perth, West Australia, AUSTRALIA","NBird"
2600,"2012-11-27",4.0,"Very interesting nose - reminds me of a dark lambic but it then becomes apparent that its the spicy saison yeast reacting with the dark goodness. Interesting taste, tart, spicy, spritzy, saison like, with faint dark malty tones. Kiss of peated smoke as it fades away. But super dry as expected with the saison yeast. Lovely beer, impressed. Realise that it is a Saison and you will understand and loooove this beer.","AUSTRALIA","foles"

2600,"2012-11-07",3.5,"Mid-dark brown, with thin but persistent head. Chocolate, yeasty, funky aroma. Its very heavily carbonated, almost like a soft drink, and has a cola-y, chocolatey flavour. Some red wine style character - leathery, maybe. Very different beer, not bad, would love to resample it when Ive got a bit more knowledge about beer.","AUSTRALIA","varanid99"
2600,"2012-10-20",3.7,"(Bottle) Clear mid brown with good beie head. The aroma is very unusual, and somewhat challenging. The dominant aroma is rather funky and I assume comes from the ""farmhouse yeast"" as it Edmonds me of a wild yeast fermented Belgian lambic. There additionally some apple and maybe smokey hints, the latter are presumably from the peat. Full body and medium carbonation with nice smooth almost creamy mouthfeel. The taste is as unusual and challenging as the aroma. It is dominated by by a collection of interesting flavours which are not immediately appealing, but could possibly become acquired tastes. I detect leather, peat, tobacco, maybe gunpowder. This is then overplayed on some pleasant rich sweetness of a molasses or burnt toffee nature and a hint of apples. Overall a fascinating and unusual beer but would take some effort to acquire a taste for it. Very pleased I have tried it, but it wont be a regular.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Pyobon"
2600,"2012-07-20",4.8,"Bottle at the Atticus Finch. Great cidery beer. Aromas of chocolate, apple, and caramel. Taste is sweet, with sour and bitter notes, and long length. Palate is creamy, and full bodied. Black, with a frothy head.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","davidm"
2600,"2012-07-18",3.3,"From a 330ml bottle on 18/7/2012. Pours a cloudy cola colour with a small head. Has a strange spicy, slightly medicinal smell, featuring ginger and yeast. The flavour is sweet with some chocolate, cola, fruitcake and berries, with a slightly sour citrus tang at the end. This is a bit of a weird beer which, though quite interesting, doesnt quite come together for me.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Maris"
2600,"2012-07-13",2.7,"330ml bottle. Pours an opaque black, with a small off-white head which fades quickly and does not leave much lacing. The aroma is quite grainy with some treacley notes, but there is also an odd, slightly sickly sweetness to it. Mild peppery hops up front give way to a cola flavour, which is followed by a thick, almost molasses-like sweetness. There is a touch of drinking chocolate towards the finish, which is itself quite bland, with some very faint leafy notes. This is not the most exciting beer I have had. It is a touch on the dull side, and feels just a bit over-sweet. I have had a lot worse, but this is not exactly inspiring.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
2600,"2012-07-09",3.3,"A ""Danish farmhouse ale"" produced by a collaboration between Denmarks roving Beer Here and Australias Moon Dog. Pretty eager to get out of the bottle - lucky I had a glass ready. Teak-brown with a surprisingly subdued head once poured. Quite Belgian under the nose, if that means anything - probably the farmhouse yeast. A bit biere de garde, a bit saison. Ginger,  wheatsheaf, floral notes. All in all, very promising. Quenching palate - thinner than I expected but it suits this very well. Fascinating flavour mix - porridge, anise, cerise, peat and a bright, minty finish. Further into the bottle, the smoky flavours from the peated malt start to build in the roof of the mouth to questionable effect. This is like nothing I ever tasted before, but thats not necessarily a recommendation. Rein in the peated malt a fraction and this could be something special. As it stands, its a beer that makes a great first impression but outwears its welcome long before the foot of the bottle. But as always, bravo for experimental brewing - we need more of this sort of approach. (330ml bottle from Leura Cellars.)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
2600,"2012-07-09",3.3,"Dark body with short head. Rye and peat on the aroma, a little bit of aniseed and liquorice also coming through in the taste.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
2600,"2012-07-02",3.1,"Pours very dark brown with a creamy off-white head.
Nose shows spicy phenols, overt citrus notes, gooseberries, pepper, doughy wheat and an almost Brett-like funky note. Later on peated malt becomes quite noticeable. Pretty wierd. Like a spicy lemonade and lime drink with brett and peated malt added.
Flavours are even more interesting. Burning leaves, faint smoked hame, spicy rye, prominent peated malt, and again, a faint citrus-like acidic note. After a few sips the peat seems to dominate, overriding everything else.
Carbonation is excessive. Nice warming alcohol though.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Davros"

2600,"2012-06-20",3.7,"Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours dark brown with a small off white head which quickly disappears. Some ok lacing is left. Nose immediately shows some funk and smoke. Works nicely together. Theres also some citrus and funky melon. Taste shows some more smokiness and it grows throughout. Only slight sourness with melon and sweet fruits front up. Finishes very dry with warming alcohol. Very nicely done. Quality brew","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"

Yeasty, funky notes at first followed by a slight acidic tang that makes way to a mellow malty biscuity layed back beverage.  A number of flavors that work well togeather that make an interesting beverage.","NEW ZEALAND","Rangi"
2600,"2012-06-09",3.2,"Maybe a little bit saison than traditional ale but generally on the make. Funky, not crazy though, with earthy spices , aniseed, cola and some bitterness to finish. Reasonably complex but the cola laden finish comes a cross a little like a weak bourbon and coke, and a find this a little off putting. Still a pretty solid effort.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

2600,"2012-06-06",3.7,"Bottle, 13C. Dark brown with a light tan head that soon fades to a coat. Aroma of berries, medicinal herbs, rye bread, lemon, licorice, light peat, singed grain. Quite light bodied - vacillated about whether it could do with more presence. Taste is barely sweet with smoke, sourish rye bread, bitter herbs and licorice. Peat and licorice build up in the dry finish.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
