547,"2017-06-13",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/16/2016. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger foamy light khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, brown bread, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and clove; with light notes of molasses, raisin, cherry, fig, date, oak char, and roast/toasted earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, pumpkin, spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, brown bread, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and clove; with light notes of molasses, raisin, cherry, fig, date, oak char, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate roast/spice bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, brown bread, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, light molasses/dark fruit, oak char, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, pumpkin, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a smooth, moderately creamy/bready, sticky/tannic, and slightly slick/syrupy/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is fairly well hidden; a light-moderate warmth, with light barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial pumpkin porter! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, pumpkin, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. Pretty much perfectly balanced between malt, spice, and bourbon barrel complexity. Great barrel presence without being too boozy, tannic, or drying. This was definitely more boozy than the Rumpkin overall, but nothing overwhelming. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Chocolate blending in after a while. ItÂ’s full-bodied, warming and nicely carbonated, with a distinct bitterness in the mouth. Sweetness, caramel, nuts, wood, chocolate hints, brown sugar and bourbon in the flavor. Everlasting warming and sweet finish.

547,"2016-10-31",3.8,"Avery Pump[KY]n 2015 15%

Opening up this Pump[Ky]n I got a big whiff of banana bread, pouring it into my snifter the inky black gave off an aroma redolent of pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, mace/cloves, allspice, nutmeg), hits of bourbon heat, pie crust and plum/pumpkin fruitiness.

Full bodied with a raspy carbonation, this beer delivers chocolate, molasses syrupy sweetness, spicing heading towards Christmas beer territory until you get that bread pumpkin pie spice hit in the finish. With a year on it (2015 vintage) I think itÂ’s mellowed quite a bit but the full body tells me itÂ’s probably good for another 3-5 years cellaring making me wish IÂ’d held on to it a year longer.

A behemoth of a beer packs a punch that can be felt all the way across the river in downtown Cincinnati. You canÂ’t get much bigger than this seasonal without turning into pure soy sauce. 

Aroma / Appearance - The deep black base sticks to the edges of the glass. Crawling downwards like slime it looks like oil residue. A dense mocha head only adds to the weighty appearance. Oak, bourbon, and spiced pumpkin from a can slowly move upwards. The thick texture covers the table with sweetness as if someone wiped up recently spilled coffee, pumpkin pie, and bourbon.

Flavor / Palate - Spiced nutmeg, bourbon, and pumpkin slices stick in the throat. The whipped cream transition coats the throat in black coffee and booze. Nothing about the beer, from start to finish, attempts to be subtle. IÂ’d love to try this again with a few years on it to see how it mellows out.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Poured a black color with 1-to-2 fingers of rocky, tan head. Minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.75)

A big whiff of boozy alcohol punched me in the nose, followed immediately by pumpkin seeds. Then got nutmeg, cinnamon stick, allspice, toffee, bourbon, light chocolate and slight buttery vomit late. (Smell - 3.75)

Taste was better than the nose. Pumpkin wasnÂ’t as pronounced here. In fact, hardly there. Got sugary toffee, caramel, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, pumpkin pie, faint nutmeg and allspice and 3 Musketeers candy. Hardly any booziness, especially when compared to the nose. (Taste - 4.13)

Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. Best part of the beer. (Feel - 4.50)

This was a really good beer. More like an American Imperial Double Stout than a Pumpkin Ale, but just solid either way. (Overall - 4.13)

Nose is pure pumpkin pie. 
Taste is very sweet and fairly full. There's a tannic oak note accompanying the pumpkin and spices. It is boozy at 17.22% but the sweetness and pie spices help it hide. Not complex by any means, but the Bourbon oak and its tannins do make themselves known on the finish (with some char), which knocked the rating down a bit.

The aroma is vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, bourbon and raisins. ItÂ’s got a good bit of booziness to it, but itÂ’s rich and pleasant enough to forgive the alcohol fumes. 

The flavor is sweet with lots of booziness thats really well matched with the spice character of the beer. ItÂ’s also got a significant raisin character with a good dosing of vanilla & oak.

547,"2014-11-05",4.2,"I Really liked this beer. Boozy and sweetly spiced. So damn legit. Melts away the problems. The headaches i have to deal with. Where to start..? My job is so fucking unbelievable.

IÂ’ll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. Anyways, very boozy mouthfeel, and a lot of complexity. a sipper if you will. to carry on with this story..

The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. IÂ’m not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat. 

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and IÂ’m sure after work. He probably hasnÂ’t been sober anytime in the last ten years, and heÂ’s only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960Â’s, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think itÂ’s trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit. Great beer, lots going on. Just donÂ’t forget the Scooby Snacks...",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"

Boozy with a bourbon sweetness followed by oak, burnt caramel and finishing with pumpkin. I loved it but you have to be ready for it and like this realm of beers.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"
547,"2014-10-21",4.2,"Bottle from Bine & Vine. Pours dark brown with a small creamy tan head. Aroma that seemed chocolate, but instantly morphed into pumpkin pie spices. Very light bourbon in the nose. Overall nose effect is quite pleasing. Med body or better. ThereÂ’s some heat burn, thereÂ’s some bourbon/vanilla, thereÂ’s some dark toasty malt, and thereÂ’s definitely pie spices. And wood. A sippy sort of thing which has a lot of complex flavors. Quite tasty!","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
547,"2014-10-21",3.8,"I don't generally like pumpkin beers but this was almost like a pumpkin beer liqueur. Super rich and sweet but not overly so. Balanced out by some drying spice notes. A nice once a year type treat.

547,"2014-10-19",3.9,"Batch 1, opened 10/19/14. Shows 17.22% ABV. Dark with minimal khaki head. Huge cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose. Big touch of clove as well. Slight alcohol heat on the aroma, but any barrel character is subdued initially. Very full bodied. Pumpkin pie spices all over the palate, and a bourbon like sweetness. Hides the ABV quite well, but it is a sipper.","California, USA","Peacehammer"
547,"2014-10-19",3.4,"Pours hazy, murky brown. Intense boozy aroma with vanilla, oak, and sweet bourbon, and dark fruit aroma. This is a sipper. The booziness is heavy and powerful. But some roasted malts and chocolate and spiced come through.

547,"2014-10-18",3.3,"Deep black pour with a thin light khaki head. Strong and powerful boozy bourbon nose with sharp oak and a touch of earthy herbal undertones. Big palate wrecking body with sharp oak, lots of char, lots of bourbony coconut and smoked black wood, and a wee kiss of dark sweet malts with a whisper of pumpkin underneath. ItÂ’s really hard to get past the gigantic bourbon tone. ItÂ’s rich like a huge beer but sharp like a spirit, with lots of char and bourbon and boozy coconut and gentle woody chocolate. Not a lot of pumpkin on the flavor. Too big for its own good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

Dunno about this so-called 16.54% ABV listed... mine clearly says 17.22% right on the label (and left wondering if those are significant dates, not ABVs).. anyway, pours an opaque brown-black, thin white head. Nose is black-strap molasses, licorice, pie spice, booozy bourbon barrel, brown sugar and sweet potatoes. Mouth is big and sticky as one might imagine, essentially tastes like someone went a bit nuts and poured a bottle of hooch into a pumpkin pie. Booze up front, in the middle and in the finish. Perfect after Thanksgiving dinner accompaniment to pie and coffee. Fuck IÂ’m wasted. ShouldÂ’ve saved this one for a day I didnÂ’t finish a bomber of Imperial Saison and a couple PBRÂ’s to boot.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
547,"2014-10-13",4.0,"6oz on tap at Ei8ht Ball. I came to Party Source for the 5pm bottle release at 5:16pm, they were sold out (apparently they only had 12 to sell). $10 a 6oz kills me, I spent 10 minutes on the fence pondering whether I wanted to do this... But I ended up pulling the trigger. I freakinÂ’ loved the Rumpkin, and am extremely excited about this one. Ei8ht Ball is pouring Rumpkin on tap as well as the KY, and side by side itÂ’s clear that this is quite a bit darker. Pours a brown, slight red color. Near black from a distance. Impressive light brown / tan head. Loose dots and short ropes of lace. Bigger body. Good full feel. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Lightly slick, light drying in the finish. Hides alcohol impressively well. Seems like a better balance than Rumpkin, a lot easier drinking. Dark fruit, great chocolate, cocoa. Hints of coffee ? some fleshy pumpkin, mild spice, and vanilla. Moderate sweet, light to moderate bitter, and a nice bit of appropriate alcohol heat on the back end. Judging from how I keep taking sips, IÂ’d say itÂ’s pretty impressively drinkable (sippable). Love it. Great to sip on.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

The flavor has mostly the same, like a boozy and sweet pumpkin-pecan pie with some fig compote. Medium-full bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, malty, really rich mouthfeel.

547,"2014-10-09",3.3,"Bottled September 13, 2014.
Glass: Carton teku.
Appearance: Black body with a short and dense tan head that quickly rests.
Aroma: The aroma is of coconut, pumpkin, bourbon, cinnamon and booze. Not bad, rather mellow, but a bit boozy. It smells a bit young, not the most enjoyable aroma, and definitely not one of a world class beer.
Taste: The flavor is huge all around. The flavors are well integrated. This tastes big with bitter dark chocolate, pumpkin, bourbon, booze, oak tannins, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and booze. There is no particular order as it blends together nicely, but man this is big. Even so the beer feels young, coming off a bit muddled. This is a bit hot, which is expected, but I think that I was expecting a more cohesive beer.
Palate: Thick as heck with mild carbonation.
Overall: This needs time to age, or maybe not. I dunno. What I do know is that at $13 a bottle I wouldnÂ’t recommend it, at least not now.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Medium/thick to thick in body. Awesome. This is a rerate.  Had this on draught, and in bottle.  The experience in the bottle was a little different - maybe the serving temperature?  Age?

Aroma is heavy bourbon, sweet lightly roasted brown malt, and big cinnamon and nutmeg notes that linger. Taste is similar: rich roasty dark brown malt with a rich brown sugar flavor; some pumpkin spice notes, but honestly secondary to the heavy malt and cinnamon sweetness here. Big bourbon throughout. Clearly a big beer, but tastes nowhere near the 17% (!) this rates at. Easily seems ~10%. Lots to like here, but not enough pumpkin and the ABV is a bit crazy.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
