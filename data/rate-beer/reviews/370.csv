370,"2016-12-29",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed on draft at Moeder Lambic  Fontainas on November 10 with Kathleen. Not sure what the special difference here is, but this is the correct rating. The pour is a pale golden yellow with a thinner white head that fades quickly, leaving a thin ring and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is incredibly acidic. The fruits and citrus in this are pretty large, as well as the mineral tendency of a good gueuze. There is a light vinegar on a deep inhale. The flavor is also good. There is a complex mineral component to go with a nice citric acid, a funkiness, a lovely tart fruit skin, and a dustiness on the finish. Its really complex, and I like it. The mouth feel is a little heavier than I was looking for, but the carbonation is great and the aftertaste is a little more mineral dominated than I would like. Its a good beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Aroma: Nose is lightish, with some bretty yeast, wood, and citrus/lemon

A: Yellow golden ale with near excellent clarity. Single finger of bone white foam falls over several moments to a sheet of the same. No lacing. 3

S: Tart and funky. Really dry nose with a good dose of the farmhouse on a hot, stagnant summer day. This is balanced well with a nice lemony citric acidity. 4

T: Nice and tart. Well done gueuze with a balance of fine, musty flavors with a good sour wild punch. Im struggling to really do justice here with the flavor profile as Im writing on a napkin, but this is really good. 4.5

M: light and crisp. A finish that is both dry and satiating. Good. 4

O: Great gueuze. Wish it was stateside. 4

Note: after this, I came to find this beer is now available stateside. I advise anybody into Gueuze to try this out. It reminds me of a mix between 3F and Cantillon Classic gueuzes. A really nice beer.

A - Pours cloudy golden amber with a one finger tall white head leaving spotty trails of lace down the glass.


S - Smells of musty basement funk, light fruitiness, damp earth, apple skins and some light acidic sourness. This draught version has quite a bit more funk than the bottles I have come across.


T - Starts off with the musty funk and fruitiness from the nose but it is much more restrained in the taste while the acidic sourness levels are ramped up a bit. Hints of grass, green apples and some light sweetness round things out. Finish is pretty dry, lingering on the palate long after the finish.


M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Dry, crisp feel throughout.

370,"2013-02-02",3.6,"Sampled at Of Love & Regret - Pub & Provisions; January 2013
The beer arrives from the tap with a lightly hazed, gold color. It is topped by a pale, head.  The aroma smells tart, with lactic acid notes, and with touches of urea. There is quite a bit of fruit character in the nose as well, and this is backed by an earthy grain character that has notes of dried straw / hay to it.

The flavor is not nearly as sour  as I was expecting; there is a definite tartness here but it is fairly soft, especially for a Gueuze / Lambic. This has a hay like grain character to it and it is lightly funky with an earthy, sort of musky character to it.

This is definitely quite a bit different from the bottled product; it needs more sourness, but it is still quite good in the end. It has more of an earthy & funky character to it than biting tartness, but in honesty, even the former is held well in check; clean, would be a good way to describe this. Somehow comes off as being a bit like a tamed Gueuze and I wonder if not being bottle conditioned has an effect on this (but I cant see that being the total explanation here).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

370,"2012-10-25",3.8,"In short: A tangy/tart gueuze.  Very good but I prefer the bottle version
How: Tap at Grünerløkka Brygghus, Oslo Norway (listed at 4.5% and not 4.8% like currently on ratebeer)
The look: Cloudy dark blond body topped by a small white head
In long: I was expecting a lighter version of the regular Tilquin, but what I got was something more tart, more lemony, more green apples and a bit less funky than the few bottles of Tilquin I drank.  Surprisingly the few bottles I had were easier to drink than this lighter tap version.  Not sure if it was specific to this batch or if the difference between the bottle and draft is always the same, I havent had every batch of the bottle version and certainly not had every batch of the Draft version.  This Tilquin Gueuze Draft Version is a very good beer, but as a true Belgian Lambic it is a little bit below average.  Another lambic I drank in a public place, another opportunity to perfect my Discreet Left Buttcheek Lift Manoeuvre.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Bread, with soft cheese and yogurt, a touch of a sharp cheesiness cuts in, faint metal, growing citrus and moderate sour fruit element. Its sour, but not acidic, with a good fruity explosion.

Really nice, some prickly carbonation, jabs of acidity, growing sourness. Mmmmmm. Funk is light, soft, gentle, with just a touch of oak.

S: Lemon-citric notes. Funky with a nice sweaty, cheesy must. Some hay and barnyard notes. Much more earthy than the bottled offering.
