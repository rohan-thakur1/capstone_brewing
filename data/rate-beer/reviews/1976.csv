1976,"2017-01-03",4.2,"Pretty much black with a tall dark brown head. Initially it seems its as thick as motor oil but the first sip shows that its a bit closer to a full medium instead of a straight full body. Powerful dark malts, roasted, a bit burnt, cocoa, some background dark fruit and dirt notes. The edges of this one are pleasantly rough. A hearty kick in the mouth just a touch under an impy stout. Dry finish.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"

1976,"2016-11-28",4.2,"Pours opaque sable with a thick, fine-bubbled and persistent tan head. Aroma delivers dark fruit, roast malt, chocolate and caramel notes. Flavor features roast malt, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, and a hint of caramel. Body seems thin for a stout, and fizz leaves something to be desired. The power of beer compels you to drink this!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Hard-edged roast in the flavour, some espresso, oily chocolate. Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. Warming finish, lightly sticky, with more bitter espresso, baking cocoa. Not bad, but a bit rough at the edges.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1976,"2016-07-04",3.6,"500 ml. bottle. Pours a medium thick, tiny bubbled, well retained beige head, with minimal lacing, over a clear dark brown (SRM 30) body......nose is heavy chocolate, dried fruits, including plum, raisin, mild coffee, minimal hps, balance to the roasted malts.......taste is slightly sweet with chocolate, light dried fruits, mild coffee, finishing drier, with a lingering roasted/burnt malt coffee, and light hop bitterness, balance to the roasted malts.......mouth feel, heavy of medium and quite full body, moderate alcohol warmth, carbonation makes creaminess and mild acid. This meets the Foreign Stout style quite well. It is rich, roasted malt dominated, and slightly under an Imperial Stout in complexity. BJCP 9/3/16/4/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"

1976,"2016-02-26",4.1,"Bottle. Pours deep and dark with thick beige head. Nose is hazelnut icecream with notes of African blood chocolate. Good lacing. Hot damn - this shit is delish. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than an impy - improving the drinkability vastly (I could have three or four of these in a night, tho I probably shouldnt). Flavors are a fresh facefuking melange of rich dark roasted cocoa and deep earthy savory flavors. I love a foreign stout and this is an absolutely superb example.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"

1976,"2015-12-27",3.4,"500mL bottle. Poured dark brown with a creamy yellowy-beige head. The aroma picked up burnt bakers chocolate with touches of star anise and a touch of vanilla. The flavor found slightly watery burnt chocolate at the core.. a little ashy on the edges.. finished dry with some ash, cocoa, and lesser dark fruit. Medium-bodied and slick at times on the palate.

Aroma of dark fruits, chocolate syrup, burnt toast, touch of smoke, dark chocolate smoked covered strawberries. Flavor started off really strong but fades a little. Medium toast, slight cardboard, chocolate on the end, figs and dark cherry plus a hint of earth. Syrupy body, medium-full, average small bubbly carbonation.

1976,"2015-07-15",2.9,"Bottle. Pours and amazing stouty brownish-black, billowy espresso colored head with ridiculous retention and wicked lacing. But, the nose on this one smells like burnt rubber and cardboard, with a hint of Nescafe in there. Mouth is big and roasty but also has an heavy ashy character that I dont care for. Overall, not horrible but definitely subpar for a Local Option brew and not something Id buy again. Oh well. Every brewer has a bad day occasionally.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
1976,"2015-07-11",3.4,"500mL capped bottle. Poured into my RBSG 2015 glass. Small brown head atop a black body. Aroma is chalky and too dry, just dry-paper roasted malts. This is fine in the flavor, more like a bigger dry stout rather than what I consider a foreign stout. Cant tell its strong than 6 abv. Light bitter malts but low on the hops.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
1976,"2015-06-17",3.8,"Pours black with a medium tan head that settles very slowly. The aroma is big on chocolate and cocoa, along with some coffee, roasted malts, hints of cherry, and slight vanilla. The taste is dry and has a slight bitterness to it. This has main impressions of roasted malts and lots of coffee. These actually dominate, as I find on lesser flavors of chocolate and cocoa. Long aftertaste is a roasted coffee. Medium body, with a thick texture, and lacking in carbonation. Its a good stout.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

1976,"2015-04-09",2.8,"Back when I got into beer (*shakes cane*), most breweries would have called this an imperial stout and nobody would have complained. Now it is just a strong foreign stout, I guess.It pours deep, dark brown in the glass w/ a giant head of foamy bubbles. This one has a big roasty character but it is a little too sharp and ashy tasty for my tastes. It has a strong resinous bitterness which seems to come from hops. This is maybe medium bodied and it seems like most of the carbonation in it ended up going to forming its large head. I tend to like beers brewed under the Local Option label but this one just isnt doing it for me. It seems big and bold for the sake of it and just comes of as a bit harsh to me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
