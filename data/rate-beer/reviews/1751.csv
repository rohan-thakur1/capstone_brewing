1751,"2017-06-04",4.4,"Thin dark brown color with a thin off-white head of foam. A festive sort of brew that is lighter than a stout, but carries the better qualities of a dark beer brewed with vanilla, cinnamon, and coffee. A great choice for a flavored stout fan looking for a lighter break.","","PugUglyBrewer"
1751,"2016-06-30",2.0,"Draught . Small lasting beige head. Clear light brown color. Huge coffee aroma. Sweet and sour coffee taste that I dont think blends well. Long lasting coffee and low bitterness and medium body.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"

1751,"2015-08-04",3.5,"A Mexican chocolate amber lager? It works pretty well. Not my favorite of the bunch but pretty solid and as advertised.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1751,"2014-08-02",3.9,"Didnt realize at first that this was a different beer than the original dos osos. A strange flavor that somehow works, its a little spicy.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
1751,"2014-07-26",3.7,"Fad: Taster på bryggeriet. Mørk ravfarvet. Fantastisk duft af kaffe og karamel. Smagen er lidt doven og den er mærkelig fordi den på en gang er lækker og fantastisk og det næste er kedelig. Alkoholen kan anes. Spændende øl.","Husum, DENMARK","Defreni"
1751,"2014-06-19",3.8,"22 oz bottle shared by drsordr. Pours a clear dark amber color with a small disappearing off white head. The aroma and flavor have moderate coffee and cinnamon, lighter cocoa notes, mild creamy vanilla on the flavor, light peppery spice, light caramel. Better than I expected it to be.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
1751,"2014-06-19",3.8,"Bottle pour cola brown with quickly dissipating thin head. Nose mostly coffee, dark chocolate, hint of chili pepper. Taste coffee and hot chocolate, Mexican style, later palate very faint chili and some spice and cinnamon in the finish. Coffee aftertaste.","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"
1751,"2014-04-26",3.9,"Bomber from Bine & Vine. Pours dark copper with a creamy beige/tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, spice, perhaps vanilla. Med body. Flavor is coffee forward. Chocolate cinnamon follows. Vanilla is pretty subtle. There seems to be enough cinnamon to suggest mild pepper. The malt is dark. It has a certain earthiness to the finish. Its not finishing wholly dry, but for me its best described as dry. Perhaps Im making too much of this, but it seems complex, then seems not complex. I keep smacking my lips. Interesting and tasty.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1751,"2014-04-22",3.8,"22oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a tan head. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla notes, roasted malt. Light body which made it very drinkable. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.

1751,"2014-04-18",3.0,"Very unique aroma of coffee grounds rather than just coffee. It tastes like chocolate covered coffee beans. Very original and not something typical.
