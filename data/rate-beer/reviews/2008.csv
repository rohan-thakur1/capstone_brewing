2008,"2014-12-30",3.7,"Part of Local Flight at Craftmen Taphouse, Charleston. Really solid for a brown -the style stuck in no mans land. Pours nice brown, not much head. Suprised how much the coffee notes come through, but nice earth, roast and chocolate in there as well. Medium mouthfeel. Hint of spice from the rye. Somewhat off flavor/ dryness in the finish. Decent, especially for a brown.","","woodychevy"

2008,"2012-12-19",3.5,"Draft at Charleston Beer Works. Pours a deep, semi-cloudy amber that leans brown and has a beige head that leaves a sheet of lace. Aroma of toasted malts, rye, earthy hops, and chocolate. Flavor of cocoa powder, rye, nuts, toast, dry leaves, and plastic. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a toasty, dry, plasticky mouthfeel. Odd beer but good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

2008,"2012-11-30",4.7,"Wow! Opaque rich brown color with nice brownish head. Wonderful malt and  molasses smell. Really fantastic taste of roasted grains and malty goodness with the perfect sweetness. The best brown I can remember and one of the best overall beers Ive ever had.

2008,"2011-05-07",3.9,"Once again, COAST makes me happy to be a Charlestonian.  Rye Knot is an awesome brown ale, tossing in tons of rye to the normal mix of roasted malts and hoppy bitterness.  The rye meshes well with the flavors of coffee and bitter chocolate, while the dry finish reasserts that this brew is indeed, first and foremost, a hoppy brown.  Think of a smarter Dogfish India Brown.  (12/2/08).","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

Aroma of doughy musty rye and fresh piny hops with some milk chocolate.  Starts with pretty good fullness and some grainy dark rye with a good fresh piny hop nose before a drier toasty finish.  A pretty good rye beer.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2008,"2010-02-11",3.5,"I missed out on all the other Coast stuff at Sexy Choc, dammit. But I had a taste of this brew, which was a nice change of pace from the other sweet brown ales we were slugging back all night. While there were certainly some sweet notes to it - bakers chocolate and a hint of toffee malts - the sharpness of the grain and yeast made it a dry and drinkable brew. Pretty nice.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

2008,"2009-12-28",3.8,"Pours a very dark hazelnut/chestnut brown color which is completely opaque with dark mahogany edges when held to a light source and a two finger beige head that quickly fades into a thin ring.

Roasted sweet chocolate malt aroma with touches of coffee, toffee, caramel, oatmeal and toast. The bittersweet dark chocolate notes are very prominent and the roastiness is subtle enough to not overpower the other scents. Slightly smokey with minimal earthy hops.

Roasty medium chocolate malt body that is a little thinner than I hoped with plenty of bittersweet dark chocolate, along with hints of hazelnut, rye, burnt toast, roasted coffee bean and toffee. The roasted malt presence is much more prominent than he aroma suggests slightly overpowering the silky chewy chocolate malt. Subtle rye sweetness and a dry finish.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Take everything you love about stouts, brown ales, IPAs, chocolate, and overly toasted malts and but them into a dark brown and beautiful liquid.

2008,"2008-12-30",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of rnorgart poured into a pint glass.  22oz bomber labeled ""Rye Not Brown Ale"".

Pours very, very dark for a brown ale - a deep mahogany - with a small, short-lived tan head that disappeared almost immediately and left no trace of lacing.

The aroma is where things started to get really interesting.  There is a bunch of things going on, starting with whiffs of the toasted rye malts with dark chocolate and hints of coffee.  Getting a little bit of caramel sweetness as well.

The taste is just as complex with the opening sweetness of caramel and chocolate giving way to a bit of roasted espresso and dark, dark malts.  The finish is slightly bitter with the coffee and spicy with the malts.  A whole lot going one but comes together very nicely.

The mouthfeel is well-carbonated despite the pour looking fairly dead.  Its definitely on the full side of things in the body for a brown ale with such low ABV.

Despite being a pretty big beer for the style, its still very drinkable.  This is my first beer from COAST and I certainly look forward to trying others after this impressive brew.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
2008,"2008-01-17",3.6,"The aroma was fruity with an estery character coupled to chocolate and a light bit of rye spice. Earthy and a bit spicy. The beer arrived blackish brown with a low beige head which lasted to lace the glass. The flavor was fruity chocolate and caramel coupled to a spicy rye flavor and a restrained earthy hop presence.  The flavor was nicely accomplished without overt sweetness. The finish was dry with lasting light chocolate and rye into the aftertaste. The body was medium with a somewhat low level of carbonation but still with a creamy and lightly slick texture on the palate. A nice pine, served a bit too cold and in a chilled glass.
