1979,"2016-12-28",3.6,"Bottle at Hunah Day. Pours a very dark brown with medium beige head that lasts. The aroma is wood, cocoa, roast. Thick body, chewy, roast, boozy finish, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
1979,"2016-05-05",2.8,"650 mL bottle. Black body. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee. Strong oak. Taste is strong whiskey. Milk chocolate. Light tang to it. Strong oak thats a little sickly. Heavy body. A little chalky. It was ok cold, but its a little gross when it warms.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
1979,"2016-04-23",4.1,"Bottle, picked this one up a year ago, sort of lost in the back of the fridge I guess. Dark brown color with a creamy brown head. Aroma is sublime; vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon barrel. Great weight, silky and substantial mouthfeel. Flavors of vanilla, milk chocolate, lacto, and bourbon barrel. Soft, the taste is lighter than the aroma would suggest, but quite good. I think this would have held its own at the annual Boise Imperial Stout Tasting last week...","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
1979,"2015-10-27",4.9,"Rating 6000!!!! Black pour, very minimal light tan head. Rich sumptuous nose with chocolate, sweet molasses and oak, a little whiskey, slight sweet darkness. Really lovely. Flavor is rich and chocolaty, some light whiskey and oak, cocoa, deep dark chocolate, and a smooth sweet chocolates finish with a touch of coffee.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1979,"2015-10-04",3.9,"Bottle: &nbsp Black, frothy beige head, nice lacing. &nbsp Sweet Bourbon nose, sweet roasted malts, maple syrup, cinnamon, and cocoa. &nbsp Somewhat reminds me of some oddly Bourbonized syrup that I would have on my pancakes. &nbsp Makes me hungry for breakfast! &nbsp Big sweet Bourbon and roasted malts on the tongue. &nbsp Dark chocolate and cocoa on the backside. &nbsp Not as complex as the nose suggested, certainly not the breakfast syrup that I smelled on the nose. &nbsp Not all that heavy either, at least I expected it to be a bit heavier but its still smooth on the tongue. &nbsp Clean finish, sweet, lingering Bourbon, dark chocolate, and cocoa. &nbsp Pretty respectable!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
1979,"2015-09-02",3.8,"Bottle shared by a friend. Pours pitch black with a thick tan head. Aroma of chocolate, oak, dark fruit, booze and malt. Malty and chocolatey flavor with some booziness before a roasted malt finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
1979,"2015-08-11",3.9,"On tap at Baileys Upper Lip. Colour...very dark brown with a thin tan head. Nose...very fruity and kind of funky with prunes and overripe blueberries. Palate...dry, tight, bitter and moderately fruity with charred berries and cherry compote. The mid palate is oaky and the finish is long and bitter.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"

1979,"2015-05-29",3.9,"Bomber from Belmont. Pours a pitch black color with a medium brown head. A big sweet bourbon nose. The flavor is charred wood, smoke, some heat, roast, light milky coffee, big vanilla bourbon. Very nice beer. Hot and big, but drinkable. Finishes dry oak and vanilla. Light dark fruit.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1979,"2015-05-27",3.3,"Wasnt for me, Weird strong raisins. Then light barrel? Freshly emptied bourbn should punch you in the face. I poured a second glass, again lame. Dumped it out, bummer.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1979,"2015-05-16",3.9,"Dark brown with a beige head. Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit. Full bodied, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, rich and slightly sweet on the palate. Taste is bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, dates, raisins.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","GothGargoyle"
1979,"2015-05-11",4.1,"Poured from a bottle purchased at a gas station in Oregon; I love Oregon. 
Aroma is fairly chocolate forward with some light roast character. A light fruitiness with raisin, cherry and plum. Light bourbon notes with light vanilla and hints of oak. 
Pours black with a moderately sized, fairly thick, light mocha head that exhibits decent retention. Medium to medium light lacing and medium legs. 
Flavor is moderately sweet with quite a bit of milk and dark chocolate notes. Some light roast and tobacco. Light raisin, plum and berry with faint caramel. Light oak and bourbon notes with hints of vanilla. Not as much vanilla as in the aroma. Medium bitterness without any hop flavor. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this is a pretty nice and flavorful stout. I expect people will say this isnt a full enough mouthfeel, but I find it to be very nice with some sticky sugars but not over the top. Great chocolate notes and a really nice vanilla character from the barrel. Bourbon notes do not overwhelm the beer.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
