1320,"2015-03-15",3.4,"Rated on 12-19-2013 at 800 Degrees Three Fires-Fort Wayne, IN. This draft beer has a small tan head that is fully lasting, transparent reddish body, fast rising carbonation, and a fair amount of lacing. The aroma is caramel malt, light toffee, lightly smokey, light hops, and fruity. The flavor is sweet, caramel malt, toffee, and fruity. The mouthfeel of this beer is moderate carbonation and this beer is medium-full bodied. The ABV is masked in this beer for me and it has a very nice flavor. It is worth trying and is a beer I would drink again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
1320,"2014-12-23",3.2,"From notes. Tasted some time near the summer of 2012 from a tall boy can. Pours cloudy dark auburn with a thin beige head that leaves very thin lace. The nose is malty, a strange, hot esthery note, and plenty of caramel. The flavor is a bit more interesting with more caramel, molasses, and some added dark bread bitterness. The body is medium plus with smooth carbonation and a long caramel malt finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
1320,"2014-11-25",3.6,"Draft to taster at Sun King. Looks good; a fairly transparent dark copperish brown with light beige head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells nice and malty with a well-balanced caramel presence and notes of neopolitan ice cream. Tastes like it smells with a medium-full body. Enjoyable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

1320,"2013-12-19",3.3,"This draft brew from a restaurant poured a medium sized head of foamy tan colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a no visible carbonation semi-transparent dark ruby red brown colored body and a good lacing. The weak aroma was brown ale. The clean mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a lingering dark malt aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of semi-sweet Helles Bock cloves mild licorice mildly vinous spices brown malt caramel crisp and hops.

1320,"2013-04-29",3.2,"16 oz pint can purchased at Keg Liquors in New Albany, Indiana.  The pour is a darker brown with some golden and a noisy one inch tan head.  The crackles down somewhat quickly.  The aroma is caramel malt, some apple fruit, and earthy peat.  The taste is sharp malt sweet, the caramel, along with toffee and brown sugar.  In addition to the sweet, there is some grass, along with earth and a touch of the peat from the nose.  The palate is medium to light bodied, a low carbonation level, almost flat, and a decent amount of alcohol heat in the aftertaste.

Some decent glow on the edges. Aromas are sticky caramel and dark red fruits, touches of raisin, cherries, and light plum. Biscuits, toast, and some smoothed out vanilla. Initial offers a medium body, grainy biscuity malts match into some sweeter sticky toffee. Gentle red fruit and dried fruit elements come forward more into the middle of the beer. Gentle toasty and biscuity elements show into the back, a touch of coffee ground and faint peat. A solid mild Scottish Ale, well done and balanced but perhaps a bit forgettable without a true defining character. Solid, yet a bit bland for such a high ABV, no?","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Pours a clear brown color with a small tan head that diminishes somewhat quickly, leaving behind an average amount of lacing as it falls to a collar.

The nose has some nice toasted bread notes along with brown sugar and caramel. Theres a touch of maple coming through as it warms and heading into the flavor. Moderate sweetness and a light bitterness coming off of a medium body thats slightly boozy.

Malt bomb here, though fairly well done and appropriate for the style with enough bitterness to carry it through. Perhaps a bit too boozy for the alcohol volume, but otherwise fairly nice.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

A - 3-Finger coffee colored head. This is the exact definition of a creamy head. Very tight bubbles, great head lacing. Very nice.Ale is dark brown to light black. Almost no light gets through.

S - Roasted malts is what I get first followed by caramel and brown sugar. Theres a bit of bready notes to this beer. Reminds me a lot of a Newcastle.

T - Well, this is a very sweet beer. Its a bit more boozy than I expected. I can taste the alcohol pretty easy. Roasted and Caramel malts, nuttines is there as well, Similar to Newcastle mixed with an Old ale mixed with some Belgian Strong ale. Its just very very sweet and thats a turn off.

1320,"2011-12-23",2.3,"The worst $20 Ive ever spent. Hate to say that because I had expected great things...They must have used a specialty batch at GABF because this shit wouldnt have been top 20 at the fest that I know. Waay too boozy, over priced and lacked sufficient flavor. Tasted like Wee Mac blended with Popov vodka. Palate was thin, watery, and the booze covered up anything until it was way past the palate. The taste (or whatever was left after the burn) was lightly roasted, with some very subtle vanilla and caramel flavors. Very remotely resembled a scotch ale, but I personally feel like the Wee Mac was much closer to the style than this garbage, which sucks to say because that tastes more like a brown ale than anything. Cant believe they are gouging the customers that made them so big pay this much for something so lackluster. $5 growlers are nice on Fridays, but $20 for this is inexcusable.","Alabama, USA","eyelovebeer"

Chocolate, tons of caramel, bread, dark fruit, and brown sugar. Just shy of being to sweet, this beer is perfect for a malthead like me. A really fantastic stab at a Scotch Ale.
