3866,"2017-06-17",3.8,"Pours a slightly hazy, bright golden orange color with a one finger white foam head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Decent retention with some spotty lacing left behind. Floral perfume-y aroma with sweet booze and a prominent citrus/ tropical fruit presence. Slightly grassy and resinous but the booze and fruit sweetness dominate. Hints of papaya, grapefruit and orange zest along with some resinous oils, pine needle and fresh cut grass. A bit one dimension but still smells pretty good. Medium body with some dry, grassy bitterness which is stronger than the aroma suggests. Crisp with earthy and grassy saaz-like hops countered by tropical fruit sweetness and a pale malt backbone. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit with some orange peel and lemon juice. Pale biscuit malt backbone with hints of bread and graham cracker.

3866,"2016-03-15",3.1,"Can.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark yellow to light amber.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, cookie), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, orange, resin, apricot), with notes of onion and alcohol.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium to full body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent. 

Fairly ordinary hop aroma, leaning towards tropical but not quite getting there...mostly just the usual citrus and resin, and unfortunately the all-too-common onion stink of so many modern IPAs. Pretty nice mouthfeel, weightier than most IPAs. A bit harsh in the flavor balance department, though...the sweetness is little match for the strong bitterness and significant acidity...it becomes a bit tiring in a short time.

Overall, a nice IPA but a bit malty for my preferences with a bit too much caramel. I like the hop profile and the bitterness but it could use more hops in the aroma.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Poured a caramel, amber, semi-clear color with two fingers of frothy white head. Some bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Very good layered foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Very good retention on the top all the way down. 

Smelled caramel, soapy pine, citrus hops, floral hops, light rye hops, orange rind, spicy Centennial hops and some wet Cascade hops. Good on the nose, initially reminding me of Modern Times Blazing World.

Tasted pretty close to the smell. Wow, this is tasty. Got caramel, earthy rye hops, wet Cascade hops, orange, grapefruit rind, citrus hops and faint floral hops. Pretty bitter and no hiding the 7.2 pct. ABV. Still reminds me of a double Blazing World.

3866,"2014-05-15",4.0,"I received this in an in person trade when I met him at the Hangar on the Wharf.
Because its an AIPA, I didnt want to wait on this, sigh, I hope I dont look like a beer snob but hopefully a beer nerd as I didnt go out fishing tonight to sit back and really enjoy this beer. Sigh, ok, here we go.
I poured this into a pint glass because it is an AIPA. I didnt see any date anywhere, but my trader did say this is two weeks old.
The appearance has a nice hazy golden color with a nice one finger white foamy head that ends up dieing after a minute. The lacing is extremely slight and stringy clinging right to the sides of the glass.
The smell is dank nasty - whoah, I love it for the most part, where did this awesome stuff come from (New Mexico, haha, I love it uh....Heady and Pliny uh...I think you have a contender), Theres a nice allocation of spicy and bitter hops to slightly overcome the sweet maltiness that ends up trying to come out.
The taste is mainly bitter but in a good way, as theres nothing really telling me theres any sweetness to it no matter how much I let it warm. The aftertaste is pure bitter and dank nasty (nasty in a spectacular way). The finish is somewhat dry.
On the palate, it sits about a medium in body with a decent carbonation that goes well for the AIPA style that is fairly harsh but still adds enough to compensate for a decent harshness.
Overall, in my opinion, this is an awesome AIPA that I would love to welcome again. However, because of where I live, Im only able to get this through trade, no worries, I would love to have this again and possibly see if I could put this with its respected food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Huge, rich hop profile is all over this with tons of actual hop qualities coming to life rather than just simple bitterness. The malts basically only exist for the hops to do their work. Notes of garlic and pepper go along with the usual citrusy and evergreen suspects. Long lasting, resinous finish. Awesome!!!

four pack from Dicks. Canned on May 18, 2014. 

This is a fantastic IPA. For anyone that wants a hugely bitter and insanely hoppy beer, this is it. The clarity is very nice here with a clear amber body and solid white head. The aroma is dank and insanely hoppy. Lots of grapefruit, a little grass, dank herbs, pineapple and ammonia. The flavor is supremely bitter, almost burning. Lots of grapefruit rind, a little melon, pine and a sharp, distinct bite that lasts throughout the finish. This is an excellent beer, so bitter that I may have trouble finishing more than a couple cans. Still, it accomplishes what La Cumbre promises and it has plenty of delicious aromas and flavor rather than sole bitterness.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

3866,"2012-08-15",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2015 Tap at Cowgirls in Santa Fe 8/15/2012
I didnt know about this one before trying it, making the experience all the better for its unexpectedness. Brilliant IPA, tangerine peel augmented with dank deliciousness. The alcohol is apparent in the mouthfeel, but in a fully-bodied way rather than a hot one. Delicious, delicious beer and a total stunner to come of Albuquerque without any advance expectatoins. 

Revisit: multiple drafts at Hotel Santa Fe Dec 2014-Jan 2015. Rich amber pour, head that sticks to the sides of the glass. Dank aroma as before, lots of citrus peel. Old school done right. Massive hop flavor and full body, herb and menthol; better for sipping than crushing. Hop oils are very strong on the close like some of the older IPAs, perhaps detracting slightly from the overall enjoyment of the beer. Still pretty impressive and miles ahead of the Santa Fe Pale that serves as its main alternative here. Id go more like 3.8 or 3.9 on this one after drinking many pints over the course of this trip, but Im going to let the original 4.1 stand because the delight of finding this out of the blue was genuine.

3866,"2012-07-22",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 24, 2012 Amazing.  Cloudy hazy orange gold pour with decent head and great retention and lacing.  Nose of all types of hops, citrus, and other fruit.  Taste is sweet and fruity with plenty of hops and a nice sweet malt backbone.  This would hold its own against most great IIPAs but as a Single IPA and only 7.2% I am not sure there are many better.  Certainly worthy of GABF gold in 2011.  My opinion may be a little slanted in that I was enjoying copius Qtys of this in 95 degree weather while on a lake in New Mexico.  Many things may taste that good in the heat on vacation.

3866,"2012-07-15",4.1,"From the can pours a deep orange with a foamy head. Really earthy and resinous hop aroma. Orange peel, pine, very earthy hop presence with a full mouthfeel makes this just so easy to drink.","Arlington, Texas, USA","jzzbassman"
3866,"2012-07-13",4.0,"7/13/12. My first rating at my new house in Jacksonville! ...and a delicious one at that! I drank about half the 16oz can (provided by hopscotch!) before I decided to rate it. Slightly hazed dark orange pour with a nice khaki head that sticks. Not a ton of lacing, but I had rinsed my glass before pouring. Complex hoppy aroma with floral aspects, citrus, bitterness, and a nice malt backing of sweet caramels and a grainy aspect that reminds me of pils malt. Slightly sweet grapefruit entry with lots of citrus and some floral aspects. Sweet sugars arrive next with some sweet caramel from the nice malt backing. Lingering dryness and floral aspects. Nice!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3866,"2012-07-11",3.9,"16 oz can. Thanks trukpro! It pours a nice clear golden color with a small off white head. It has a very complex hoppy aroma of pine, spice, light melon and tropical fruit with a touch of toasty malt. The flavor is intense with dense spicy hops cat pee, pine, smooth malt character and a biting, spicy finish. There are some hints of tropical fruit and dank as well. The mouthfeel full and the carbonation is a bit low. I would not call this a ""citrusy"" IPA, but it is very tasty nonetheless. Well done.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

Aroma is filled with sweet citrus fruits, orange, tangerine, some grapefruit, peach and tropical fruits. The flavor follows the nose and is super fresh, as I say, fresh squeezed hop juice. I get, tropical fruits like mango and pineapple, and orange, tangerine and peach. The body is medium with a dry mouth feel. Overall an amazing IPA, this one surprised me!","Nørresundby, DENMARK","beerisgoodforu"

3866,"2012-03-03",4.0,"Sampled March 2011; RBWG
The beer pours from the growler with a pale tan head that sits on top of a clear, copper hued beer that shows a brightness when held up to the light. There is a really, dank hop character to the nose that is a mix of tropical and citrus fruit and hemp oil.  The nose is just so dank and juicy; specific notes of tangelo, a bit lychee character, mango, a hint of menthol, and just a really big hemp like character is found here. There is a touch of supporting malt character that provides hints of a cracker like whole grain character.

The beer is lightly sweet and has a fair amount of a crystal malt backbone to it. The hop character is of course the dominant note in the flavor, with a nicely herbal character, lots of hop-fruit, a firm bitterness (that is not over the top), lots of pine notes, a firm herbaceous hemp-seed like flavor, and rounding notes of lychee and even some mango are noticeable here.

This is nice and dankly fresh. I like how light and quaffable this is, as that is really what I want in an IPA. The flavor doesnt quite live up to the promise of the aroma, but this is still something I am quite happy to be drinking.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3866,"2012-02-09",3.9,"Several pours from a growler generously shared by csbosox, who picked this up at the brewery approximately 10 days ago. The pour is copper orange ruby with a smallish off white head. Nice lacing left as the beer falls. The aroma is resin, catty, slightly dank, hint of pine, some cracker malt and a nice mineral note in the finish. The taste is big resin right away, great dank bitterness, toasted malt, quite dry in the finish with a great mineral after taste. The palate is medium bodied, a lower carbonation level, and the dry crisp finish.  Thanks a ton Chris for bringing this back and sharing, I have been wanting to try a La Cumbre beer since they started up.  I would love to try this fresh at the source, even after 10 days in a growler this was great.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3866,"2012-01-07",4.5,"Courtesy of ketchepillar at the Black Friday Tasting, thanks Sam, pouring up clear deep gold with an off white head. The aroma offers up rich citrus goodness with a nice supporting layer of malty sweetness in the background. Smells of pure YUM. The taste has firm bitter and flavor citrus hops rolling into modest levels of sweet maltiness. The citrus hops are just rich and vibrant and nicely sweetened up by the maltiness. This is crisp and yummy and amazing stuff. I could drink a ton of this. This is one of those beers that starts off amazing and somehow gets even better the more you drink.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Nose is very fragrant and clean. Lots of citrusy notes and a hint of caramel. On tasting, its got a nice bitterness that pushes it to the good side for an IPA. Light caramel notes come through with the citrus and it finishes quite dry. Really great IPA overall.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Bready malt base with a dank, citrusy, piney hop attack in yo face.  Really great.  Medium-bodied and enamel-ripping with a good carbonation level.  One hell of an IPA from out of nowhere.

3866,"2011-01-16",4.0,"Tap at brewery. Pours a wonderful glowing golden copper with thin white head. Wonderfully exquisite and powerful aroma of American hops. Notes of citrus, pine, and grapefruit waft out towards the drinker. The aromatic hop profile comes through strong and beautiful in the taste without the overpowering bitterness you would assume from such a well hopped profile. The malts are well subdued, providing just enough sweet backbone to make this beer entirely too easy drinking.  Palate is smooth and silky with a very pleasing bitter aftertaste.  In a country where IPAs have been well overplayed this beer stands up gracefully!","Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","Rockcrawler"

The brewer says this is 100 IBUs, yet the flavor is not just an overpowering experience of bitter hops. This brew manages to achieve incredible balance and drinkability. Its malt base is lean and unobtrusive while still providing enough sweetness to stand up to all those hops. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, almost oily. Herbal resins cling to the tongue while a sweet green aftertaste lingers indefinitely. A sublime example of the American IPA style.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","blazingspiral"
