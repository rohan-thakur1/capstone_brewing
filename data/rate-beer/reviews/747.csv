747,"2016-03-03",4.1,"Draught masu at the brewery upon release. I assume they must have held some barrels of this back for release every year, as I didnt hear of them brewing it again, yet its been on tap for a short time every year since the original brew.""Thick"" looking enamel-colored body is quite still with an immediately dissipating off-white head.Heavily fruity, with tons of umami mixing with caramel and rich, caramelized honey. Yellow fruits, strong black pepper phenols and lots of melon. Really, really interesting to finally see a beer/sake hybrid and though theres not much to go on for precedence, subjectively, I loved the stuff. The fruitiness, acidity and phenols all balanced the sweetness very nicely and I didnt find it syrupy or cloying at all. Extremely soothing on the palate and I didnt find it to be boozy given its strength. Hope they have more and/or do this again soon.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
747,"2013-10-31",3.3,"Pour on tap, golden pour with thin white head, aroma brought notes of sake, cracker, biscuit, slight white grape, fruity notes, much more sake than beer in my opinion. Taste is a mix of sake, more sake, slight yeast, cracker, biscuit, some slight spice and grass, finishing bitter, slightly boozy but for 15% is hidden fairly well.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
747,"2013-08-04",3.8,"On the draft the brewery, this was very cool, booze and rice sake flavors show, this is neat","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
747,"2013-07-06",3.6,"Pours a golden/orange with thin white head. Smells of sake more than beer, different taste in a good way, never had anything quite like it, crazy idea that works","Holliston, Massachusetts, USA","berniecarbo"
747,"2013-05-25",3.7,"5 oz. taster from @ the brew pub. Brown color with an orange hue. No head. Smell is unlike any beer Ive had. And Its been years since I drank any kind of sake but... This is cool stuff. Nose of sweet malts and alcohol. The 15% is nowhere to be found except a slight warming after the sip. Lots of sweet flavors, butterscotch, toasted barley and some notes of grapes. Flavor isnt cloying even with a lot of sweetness. This gets points for originality.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
747,"2013-05-22",4.1,"Served in a traditional sake glass + box. Pours orange with nearly no head. Smell is both sake and fruity hope with some caramel maltiness. Palate is on the heavier side of medium bodied with nearly no carbonation. Taste starts sweet and fruity, then gets bitter before suddenly becoming sake in my mouth. VERY interesting brew, highly recommended.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GuillaumeCL"

747,"2012-09-09",3.6,"Draft at the source. Holy cow. Hazy golden color, flat. Aroma resebles sake much more than it does beer. Taste is strong straw, pale malt, subtle anise. Does not seem boozy. Holy cow.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
747,"2012-08-31",3.0,"Tap at cbc.   Sweet toast and honey.   Touch of cough syrup.   Boozy gummy bears.     Alcohol relatevily well incorporated for 14you percent.     Easy drinkin, but not really my thang.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
747,"2012-07-21",3.4,"Tap at the brewery. Light amber pour served in a 5 ounce glass set in a wooden box. Faint white grape juice nose. Taste is sweeter than expected like a light barley wine. Honey, booze, and a sake finish. slippery in the mouth. Good.

747,"2012-05-18",4.1,"On tap at the brewpub. Awesome soft fruit and asian pear skin aroma. It just has this awesome soft floral, plum, and warm wind aroma. Takes me some place beautiful, with soft light, and just the right of ocean humidity. Flavors are a little more vitriolic. Wow. This has heat and intent. I like this. Its a slow, sweet sipper. The grain complex is soft and earthen. Overall flavors are subtle and waft between sake and something like a beer pommeau. Love the clean dry rice finish. Totally worth it experiment.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
747,"2012-05-11",4.4,"On draught at the brewpub.  Arrived a clear warm gold with a linen white ring for a head.  Pleasant aroma of rice and malt.  It is in the flavor that this marriage really excels.  Rice, malt, brown sugar, and caramel abound.  Softly effervescent on the palate.  Mild warming at the finish enhances the experience.  Exquisite.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
747,"2012-01-06",3.8,"(Draught)  Pours a clear yellow body with a moderate off-white head.  Aroma of rice, wood, florals, and grilled plantains.  Flavor of butterscotch, apple, wood, rice milk, and honey.  Alcohol is nicely hidden for the abv.   An interesting experimental brew.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
747,"2011-12-20",3.2,"On tap at GABF. Interesting beer. Pours with a clear golden body with a minimal white head. Aromas are sweet, boozy, rice, apple esters, light floral and spice notes. Flavors are sweet, way too sweet for my tastes, grainy (nearly wheat like), starchy, koji, some light alcohol. Syrupy and warming on the palate with light carbonation.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

747,"2011-05-07",2.9,"A translucent copper hybrid with no head, and the occasional bubble rising, thick oily liquid. In aroma, rising dough, solvents, unpleasant. In mouth, reminiscent of Chinese rice wine, doughy, sweet rice alcohol, loads of warmth, but overall, why. On tap at brewpub, April 17, 2011.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
747,"2011-03-22",3.2,"I am giving this beer a higher score than I probably ever could have imagined.  Has all the elements of sake I dislike, particularly an extremely apparent booze factor, but manages to be a bit interesting from a spicy earthiness that holds things a bit in check.  I still hate sake.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
747,"2011-03-17",3.6,"Pouring at the Saturday sessions of EBF.  Pours a clear gold, very still looking.  Soft banana and warm rice, fruit.  Sweet with light effervescence in it.  Very warm alcohol, lingers a bit, but its not harsh.  Warm and toasty.  Rather nice overall.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
747,"2011-03-02",4.0,"Pours bright dark gold into a snifter. No head or lacing. Tropical fruit aromas. Thick with sweet rice, spice and honey upfront. Lasting, dry sake finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"

Fruity, light wooden, rice and spiced aroma. Fruity apples, rice sweet, mild liqourice and lingering caramelish to light yeasty flavoured. Sweet and slight phenolic finish, slight bitter too. Smooth.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
