1532,"2014-06-16",3.9,"Tap. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow gold body under a small fizzy white head. The nose is really fruity and lively with some nice restrained coriander notes, plenty of yeastiness, wheat, and a bit of pale bready malt. The flavor is super soft and smooth with just the right mix of spicing, not overdone with the coriander like many American attempts as Wit. Just really smooth with plenty of yeastiness and soft wheat. Really nice soft and creamy mouthfeel with soft gentle carbonation. This is the exact beer that Id be looking for in the Florida heat. Really well done Wit.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
1532,"2014-06-07",3.1,"A lightly hazed golden Wit with a thin white. In aroma, light fruity banana with smooth cloves, OK. In mouth, a nice fruity banana malt with cloves, nice. OK. On tap at Brewery.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"

Flavor was pretty spicey and yeasty, loys of ginger for sure, but natural seeming. Unique but a bit too spicey for my liking.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"

1532,"2013-03-13",3.5,"Draft pour on tap at the brewpub (Winter Park, FL). Pours a nice hazy straw yellow hue, some gold, gentle orange. Darker and dulled body, mellow glow on the edges shows yellow, some gentle orange in this light. More a natural applesauce feel. Frothy whitish head atop is filmy, mellow layer laces ok. Aromas are a bit more inviting, nice bready malts meet a melange of orange and lemon rind and fruit that play well against each other. Some grains of paradise give some lemon, gentle bready malt, some soapy, brighter citrus grows as it warms. Touches of straw, gentle cool spice. Coriander doesnt really show up, those Grains of Paradise offering a mellow spice and more of a lemony vibrant tang and feel. Initial is lighter end of the fold, some nicer bright orange and lemon meet bready malt, flaked wheat. Lighter body, sessionable, some mellow bready grainy elements meet orange, grains of paradise and that lemony tang. A brighter flavor, gentle soapiness, lemongrass, and mellow earth. Middle is more wheat, gentle dough, some mellow malty sweetness but pretty crisp, fairly dry. Backend offers a touch of prickly spice, mellow soap, mellow spice and dry bitterness (kinda combines with the lemon element). Touches of dryness, faint lemon cookie, spice, and dryness. Touch of soap. Pretty interesting. Much different than I normally go for, a touch tart up front. Pretty solid and more unique offering for the style. Solid.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Nose is sharp pickled sushi ginger, sharp lemongrass. Taste is major fresh ginger, huge lemongrass, extremely herbal. Refreshing body.

Light-bodied with zippy carbonation. The flavor leans bitter and a tad spicy. Finishes wheaty and refreshing. Excellent session ale.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
