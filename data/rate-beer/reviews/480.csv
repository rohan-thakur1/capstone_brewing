480,"2017-02-19",4.4,"Pours a very dark brown color, not quite black. Has a super huge head, about three fingers or more. Super good retention, excellent lacing. As I poured, this huge head was swirling and everything, and it looked it had some black sediment swirling around, and I thought it looked like chocolate sprinkles. Wow!!Aroma is well, coffee. Coffee, coffee and baking chocolate. Coffee strong. Baking chocolate medium. Dark fruits are light. Theres some medium dark roasted malt in there too.Taste is much the same. Lots of chocolate!ate, some chocolate and a little, barely noticeable dark fruit. Very coffe, but also very sweet.Mouthfeel is medium bodied at best. Its a little watery, it could stand to be a tad heavier. Smart business move, because if it were heavier, it would be perfect, and our quest for great beer would be over. But theres a little bit of sediment, like coffee grit in there. Overall, this is great! Almost perfect. Maybe Im partial, because I love coffee so much. But I call em like I see em.

480,"2017-01-12",3.3,"Hmm well this was an interesting seasonal novelty, from the bottle pours with a strong flavorful sweet coffee and roasty aroma, with notes of chocolate. Great appearance of charred black with a ruby highlight, full off-white head with Guinness-like lacing. Flavor is lightly roasted malt, espresso, milk chocolate, cocoa, hint of licorice. I dont mind its contribution to the flavor, but I dislike the coffee infusions impact on the palate and mouthfeel, seems to have thinned out and watered down the texture, finishes just as if finishing a sip of iced coffee. Perhaps just utilizing coffee bean in the brew instead of already brewed coffee may avoid that issue. Either way its not bad, but if I want to drink coffee Ill actually get a coffee instead of mixing it with my beer.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"

480,"2015-09-19",3.3,"Sampled November 2014
A steady pour produces a fat-two-finger thick, nicely brown-stained, dark tan colored head. The beer is a dark chocolate color. The aroma has smooth notes of roasted coffee to it even as I am pouring it. A more focused look at the nose yields a bit sharper, more burnt, and even a touch acrid, roasted coffee character. Burnt berry notes (typical of coffee), dark chocolate, well charred wood, smooth roasted coffee, burnt black pepper, and a smooth, dark / roasted malt character that adds lots of toasted / roasted whole grain.

Smooth and a bit silky textured up front, it quickly picks up an effervescent, prickly carbonation and the roast character cleans the palate quite well towards the finish. Fairly dry tasting with all of the dark malt, and burnt coffee notes, there is a touch of rounded, toasted, whole-grain maltiness that isnt quite sweet, but leans towards that and adds a touch of richness to the beer. The roast character, between the dark grain and coffee addition, is easily the most dominant part of the flavor profile; lots of acrid, bitter, burnt, roasted character is contributed by the coffee, and supported by the dark malt.

Definitely a Coffee Stout, it could use some more malt richness to balance things out here","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

480,"2015-07-25",4.2,"355ml bottle bought at Q-Club in SoHo, Central.
Looks: Clear deep Cola blackish brown colour with thin bits of yeast sediments; Half finger head and beige foam which fades in 30 seconds; Beautiful sticky lacing and zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant, subtle nut-roasted dark malt, with strong rich cocoa, strong caramel, vanilla, sweet toffee, iced coffee, strong cream, sugar, yeast and thin lemon.

Taste: Mid to strong sweet dark malt, with strong roastyness, fairly strong tartness, strong nuts, strong cocoa powder, black coffee, burnt toast, caramel, sugar, fairly strong resin, yeast, strong lemon, strong bitter hops and strawy grass.

Body: Medium body. Thick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong dark maltyness in a fairly wholesome body despite strong wheaty tartness. Roastyness is as goos as its aroma, solid and very roasted peanut-like. Then its a flush of cocoa-powder, burnt toast, black coffee, sugar with strong resin ooze whicjh ended in strong and nice lemony grassy hops. Complex and comfy!

Hoppiness: Thin lemon in nose. Potent resin, strong lemon and strong strawy grass in taste. Bitterness is mid-to-strong and tasty for a lasting, mid-bitter chocolate-malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Cocoa-rich and roasty bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one is more like a chocolate stout than coffee, with complex and subtle nutty roast, cocoa powder, toast, and resiny hops all folded into one nice drinking experience. Great for Summer, and just about any day in the year. Cheers!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

480,"2015-06-25",3.8,"A 12 fl oz bottle with a packaged date of 28th October 2014, and poured into a snifter glass.

Strong vanilla aromas with dark chocolate, roasted malts and coffee. Tastes of dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and some light caramel. Medium bodied, mild but prickly carbonation, creamy and smooth. Overall, this bottle was less than 8 months old and Im thinking the coffee in it may already be less pronounced. The problem is that its not that easy for me to find it fresh in Hong Kong. It doesnt have the crisp fresh coffee bean bite like that of Founders Breakfast Stout that I really enjoy.

I have to say Im perplexed by the commercial description, the bit about it being an ""ultimate warmer"". The warming effect of a ""cup of joe"" happens BECAUSE ITS SERVED WARM/HOT. But I guess marketing is rarely about making sense. Anyways, the beer itself is ok...pretty simple and overly roasted but ultimately drinkable. Part of the winter mix pack, which is pretty much a scam...3 bottles of drain pour oniony Boomerang IPA, 3 bottles of drain pour vitamin B bomb Pale Ale (great ""winter"" beer, guys, so special!), 3 bottles of drinkable Porter, and 3 bottles of this stuff. So half drinkable but not very interesting and half drain cleaner. Great job. I mean, hey, I knew what was in it before I bought it but I find it sad that they STILL cant make their Pale Ale smell like much more than raw yeast / vitamin B.

480,"2014-11-17",3.6,"Bought the 12 pack and drank the 3 of these while frying fish. Fun times. So with coffee beers there tends to be 2 extremes and this one falls somewhere in the middle. There are those coffee porters/stouts that are all cold coffee flavor with little malt backbone or any depth at all, thin and empty, and I usually hate them all. And then there are those that are big on dark chewy malts and the coffee is there more as a complementary flavor than the focus. I generally love these. This beer is somewhere in the middle. It has plenty of body and dark roast and chocolate malt, feels pretty similar to their standard stout. But this one also has a huge coffee component, very strong coffee aroma and fairly prominent coffee flavor too.

480,"2014-11-16",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2014 Bottle. Nose is dark and luscious roast with a strong fruity current, theres some coffee and chocolate, too, with what Id call aromatic sugar crystals. Pours dark brown with ruby highlights but pure pitch in the glass, a large and rocky light brown head. Medium body is lightly bitter with sultry chocolate and again a wave of bright fruit; coffee is more of an accent here, and then only at points. Pretty malty with some good depth, rounded mouthfeel with a touch of acridity in an otherwise smooth and bitter aftertaste. Very light toffee, faint woody-earthy hop notes, touch of milk character. I prefer these sorts of beers to be roastier and much more aggressive (even harsh), but this is a masterpiece.

Earthy coffee aroma with a mild roastiness, but a larger component of creamy, almost milky sweetness that lends to some bakers chocolate & charred brown sugar notes towards the back-end. Flavor is a little more roasty with a nice, oily coffee bean explosion, hints of bittersweet cocoa nibs, roasted malts, & a faint earthy smoke that wafts in lightly towards the finish. A touch of sweet cream & burnt brown sugar adds a tiny bit of balancing sweetness. All around, a pretty easy drinking coffee stout, not bad, maybe just a touch thin.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Taste strongly of dark coffee flavor, with added sweetness from cocoa and dark fruit elements which are definitely there. This has about everything I love in a stout, but surprisingly the coffee flavors are too strong and take away from the beer experience a bit.
