1781,"2017-06-21",1.7,"Gold brown clear. Smells like dull hopped lager. Probably more like a IPL in taste. A logger lager for somebody who like bitter IPA hops. Perhaps just a tad of vienna in there. Near 6% and it never lets you forget.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

The nose was some bready malt, hints of caramel, vanilla, straw, & banana, slight spicy phenols, and a touch of citrus. The taste was similar, medium bodied, with good carbonation, adding a lingering earthy & resinous bitterness that was a little aggressive for the style. Finished crisply, and a decent grill complement.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
1781,"2017-04-03",3.1,"Pours a dark ruby color with a fairly large white head. Weak aromas of grass, bread and some citrus. Pleasant flavors of tropical fruit, citrus, bread dough, hay and some caramel malt. The flavors come together nicely with a slightly bitter finish. This is an interesting take on the traditional Amber and Id say it has been successfully pulled off.","West Virginia, USA","WVHouseofBeer"
1781,"2017-03-31",3.6,"12 oz bottle pours a clear copper color with medium off-white fluffy head. Aroma has bread, molasses, grapefruit, and pine resin. Taste is slightly sweet with a hoppy, dry finish. Body is light to medium with average carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel. Im generally not too fond of Amber Lagers or big breweries, but this one was refreshing, easy to drink, cheap ($4.99 per 6) and much more satisfying than expected. Well balanced and a bit different.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"
1781,"2017-03-19",3.5,"3/18/2017: Goose Island Preseason Lager pours a beautiful copper color. Aroma is lighty hoppy along with some nutty bread; flavors include dried leaves, lightly toasted malt, caramelized yellow grapefruit (but not sweet), slightly sour and a definitely fruit that I cant really call out by name, slightly dry in the finish. Overall, this is a hoppier Vienna Lager than one would expect for the style, but the flavor profile works well. Dumb name, but really good beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

1781,"2017-02-27",2.2,"Im not sure what they are going for w/ this but it kind of tastes like a brewpub amber circa 2003. So thats not great. It has a muted fruity hop character, its too sweet and the finish is loaded w/ sticky, woody bitterness. Theres an interesting bubblegummy stressed-yeast malt-liquor character floating over the top as well. If you are one of those people who complains about the state of craft beer these days, go take a step back in time, drink this and shut the fuck up.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

1781,"2017-01-11",3.5,"Preseason Lager presents a simple formula: American-style Amber Lager + extra hops. Its simple, but it delivers. Reddish pour. West Coast ale aromatics with zesty citrus and pine. Flavor is more mellow than the aroma would have you believe. There is a bright tropical fruit character and its crisp, yet the bitterness is held back by the caramel malt. This has more fresh hops than your average Lager, and that brings a stupid smile to my face.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
1781,"2017-01-08",2.9,"Aroma of some bread, caramel, and a tiny note of pine/grassy hops. Crystal clear orange amber color with a nice off white head and nice lacing. Rich sweet caramel malt up front. Sweetness is quickly eclipsed by a dry bitterness. Some pine and earthy tones, of which intensify on the finish. Finish is somewhat balanced, leaning more towards the bitter tones. Light crisp mouth feel. Interesting twist on a Vienna. I prefer the more original, but this is a nice change of pace.","Round Lake, Illinois, USA","sawbuck"
