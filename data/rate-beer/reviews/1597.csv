1597,"2013-05-09",2.4,"Bottle thanks to bman1113vr from way back a few years ago.  The smell is  sweet, picnic cooler, plastic, and eh.  The look is milky, whitish cloudy.  The taste is weird, off, alcohol, and sweet.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
1597,"2012-08-16",2.8,"0.33l bottle bought at a local liquor store in Ulsan, South-Korea, I have been looking forward to this one. It pours a body that looks exactly like a Schweppes soda does. Near no head. Its kinda sweet-ish on the aroma with a hint of grapes and paint. Yeah, paint! It actually smells like paint! It has a slick oily thing that glides down my throat. It tastes mildly sweet, but not to sweet, hints of both light sour lemons and a really really strong pear-nectar flavor. A bit watery and sweet finish, before the aftertaste is dominated by good old spicy pepper. All in all this Schweppes-looking thing tasted actually quite alright. 27.04.2012","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

1597,"2010-06-28",1.6,"(300ml bottle, courtesy of BMan1113VR)  Pours an opaque milky body with light legs.  Aroma of sweaty socks, insect repellent, and plastic.  Flavor of rice milk and insect repellent.  Horrid.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
1597,"2010-06-26",1.8,"(300ml bottle thanks to BMan1113VR) milky pour thats full of particles, decent coating of the glass but no legs, looks nasty almost like if you liquified a diaper. Nose of old underwear and diapers, cheese, rice, alcohol. Taste of alcohol, rice, peach, chalky, coconut. Medium body, particles linger around, not too enjoyable. Kind of nasty.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
1597,"2010-06-13",1.7,"Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle.

The sake pours a milky white color that leaves residue on the glass. This is an awful looking beverage. The aroma is a mix of honey with some sugar and dirt. The flavor is better, but still not great, with some coconut, sweet fruit and alcohol.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
1597,"2010-06-11",2.7,"bottle thanks to bman1113vr.  milky white pour.  coats the glass and leaves a film of stuff on the glass.  nose is flowers, honey, and nuts.  smooth on the palate, coats the mouth with florals, alcohol, and a nutty finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
1597,"2010-06-11",1.9,"Bottle. Pours with a milky colored and textured body with some light legs. Aroma of dirty urinal, feces, sweet and industrial. Port-a-potty cleaner. Taste is dirty water and decently sweet. Not appealing in the slightest. Probably the worst Nigori that I have had to date. Coating mouthfeel, not enjoyable.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1597,"2010-06-11",2.1,"bottle, thanks to bman111vr, ugly cloudy milk water color in  suspension, aroma and flavor of coconut husk, betl, antiseptic alcohol finish","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
1597,"2010-06-10",3.1,"Bottle: Pours a cloudy white color with very small particles. The nose is sweet and light with some pear and light coconut and melon; koji is present. The impact is subtle and sweet, very light alcohol (10%?) and a thin mouthfeel for a nigori. Seems not right to lower the alcohol level to make something more palatable, but probably is more popular because of it.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1597,"2007-10-29",2.9,"A thick milky white, like the soy milk I usually drink. Leaves many small bits of sediment on the side of the glass. A sweet grainy milky scent but laced with alcohol. Thick grainy milkshake, with a kick! Nigoris sure are an unusual type of sake and definately an aquired taste. Ive only had a few I really enjoyed, most I didnt, this falls somewhere in between on the favorable end of the scale.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
