3580,"2016-12-26",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of Reynolds314, thanks! Hazy to cloudy straw color, white head. Nice aroma of coriander at the seashore. Taste is earthy, spiced, lightly sour, very easy drinking.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3580,"2016-10-20",3.6,"Bottle at Earth Eagle bottle share. Light, tart, and salty. This is a refreshing gose thats definitely started to take on some distinct funky/sour notes as its aged.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
3580,"2016-10-15",3.7,"Sampled at GABF 2016 with Paul and Larry. Pours a pale, bright yellow body with soft haze and white head. Nose is salty and fresh. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of salt upfront - a bit too salty overall; additional notes of tart wheat and spice.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3580,"2016-07-23",3.5,"Tap at the source. Pours hazy unfiltered pale yellow. White head. Aroma is super barnyardy, grass, funk, hay, lemon lime, sea salt. Funky. Flavor is super funky sea salt, lemon lime, and again, barnyard funk, hay. Not overly acidic on body. Nice.","New York, USA","SG111"
3580,"2016-07-19",3.2,"From notes. Enjoyed this at a tasting at Andrews house for my first tasting with the Ann Arbor crew on July 8! 750 mL bottle. The pour on this a light foggy yellow, almost like an oyster juice, with a small white head that dissipates without much lace. The aroma is where this really falls apart. This thing smells like seafood and coriander. Im definitely not a fan of this at all. This is just a mess. I dislike the oyster aspect to this for sure. The flavor is a lot more sour than the nose lead on. Though, at that point, all I had was seafood. There is a little fruitiness to it that isnt really overpowering. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a brighter carbonation and a lingering spiciness. There is an interesting tart oyster thing happening as well, but its not my jam at all. Ugh.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3580,"2016-05-30",3.7,"Bottle thanks to Brandon. Pour is clear gold with a small white head. Aroma is herbal with coriander and lots of salinity. Lightly funky. Nice. Flavor is sharply tart to start with and then notably salty. Then citrusy coriander notes. Not to much oyster but there is some mineraly notes there. Nice.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
3580,"2016-04-08",3.9,"Foggy blonde. Good wine style bottle. Rich, tangy, biotic, doughy aroma. Nicely sour, yeasty, biscuity, zesty. Mouthy, tart aftertaste. Thanks to pals down at Proof. From their stash.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
3580,"2016-03-19",3.7,"Bottle - Salty, mango and some funk. Cloudy gold with no head. Candied mango, slats and a very clean finish.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3580,"2016-02-09",3.4,"Bottled 9/5/14. Lets see what happens. The pour is a luminous, clear gold, bubbles rushing to the surface to form a quickly dissipating head that retreats to the edges. Pungent aroma is a blast of lemon and salt, powerfully acidic and gripping, and shielding the briny layers beneath. These are shifty and enigmatic, showing hints of barnacle and tidal funk and mineral riverbed; this is not disconnected from the brined sensations found in gueuze, but this is like wading amongst the mangroves or the tidal ponds, such is its intensity. Whether this can be attributed to the oysters at this late date I dont know, but Im going to assume so. Simplistically, sometimes this impression is more mucky wallpaper and paste, might have been better off to have not let this sit.

Bracing acidity and searing citrus juice in the taste; its hard to retrieve much more than this at first. Sun soaked pineapple and biting lemon are eventually softened, as floral touches of coriander and chamomile are let in. The still-potent presence of salt and its partnership with all that acid make this a mouthwatering drinking experience even if its not so much to return to the enjoyment of it. The weight of the acidity has enveloped everything else, the subtleties found in the aroma. The mouthfeel is aided by soft bubbles that balance the acidity somewhat, but probably not to the necessary degree. It brings more pain than pleasure.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3580,"2016-01-15",3.8,"Sourd In September 2015. Pours a hazed gold with a thin white head. Musk, soft acid on the nose. Medium-bodied, tart, funky, tangy acid. Long and funky, tangy, soft sweet tarts flavor on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

3580,"2015-10-23",3.4,"750 ml bottle

Aroma: Briny smell with hint of apricot.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden-yellow color with a thin layer of foam which settles quickly.

Taste: A savory sour taste, coupled with light grassy flavors ending with hints of floral and ginger.

Palate: Thin/light body with lively fizz

Overall: Good specialty beer that balances savory with sour flavors and evokes the feeling of the beach with each sip. Initially unsure of the brininess, I am certain that this will grow on you.","Everett, Massachusetts, USA","beerhunter84"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy lemon, sea salts, minerals, and coriander. It pours a hazy dull gold with a small white head that quickly fades to a minimal film outlined by a thin ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus before heavy acidic lemon and lime takes over. There is some light sea salt in the finish with a touch of minerals. Its light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, very tasty but almost a little too acidic.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

3580,"2015-05-16",3.5,"750 ml bottle, thanks to Willrunforbeer bottled on 9-15-14. Crystal clear without head. Aroma is salt, sugar and lemon juice.  
The flavor is a mild pepper upfront with a wheaty base. The coriander is subtle (thankfully) with mild acidic notes. The body is the heavier side of light, almost medium with a chewy malt and grain. Moderate amounts of lemon rounded out by salt. The mouthfeel has a nice lively pop for the carbonation. This is a nice drink overall.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

3580,"2015-05-16",3.3,"Bottle (750 ml). From Brian, thanks! Split 5-ways. 

Appearance: Almost clear pale golden with a small white head and little to no lacing. 

Aroma: Coriander, ginger, lemony notes, mild smokey/meaty presence and light acidic notes.

Taste: Moderately acidic with ginger, coriander, mild smokey-meaty presence, salty notes and mineral notes.

Palate: Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. A bit acetic as well. 

Overall: Not the most balanced Gose and not the most Gose-ish gose either, but still not bad and fairly enjoyable. A bit too acetic and weird meaty presence but other than that its fair game.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3580,"2015-05-16",3.2,"Pours a unclear golden with no head and thus no lacing. Nose is of coriander and feeling fresh overall. Taste is of coriander as well, a touch over ""moderate"" for acidity and not too salty for a gose. Slight umami mixed with lemon. Overall it was OK but I might have been grossed out by the thought of oysters in beer. Still, it didnt feel too much like a gose too. Just OK.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3580,"2015-03-11",3.7,"Draught at the brewery, 5/24/14Very bright, pale-golden body is lightly hazy and very effervescent. Quite Belgian Witte-looking. Small to medium white head tops it, showing moderate to low retention.Low amounts of coriander in the nose give plenty of room for the lemon to shine, providing tart acids to go with the soft, very minimally sugared light malts. Some touches of faint salt/seawater are noted and theres certainly some lacto/aceto thing going on as well.Less lactic acid in the flavor than expected, and filling that gap is lots of lemon acid, very chewy, dry wheat and a vanilla-cream sort of maltiness (from the wheat and barley). The up-front zip seems to get lost amidst the other aspects, though theres no requirement for it being incredibly tart/sour (and to be fair, the citrus keeps it quite tart where some of the lacto aspects fail). Very well structured and despite being of more substantial body, it is quite dry and still quenching. Seems on the border of a Belgian Wit, but then, I suppose the style itself already is.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
