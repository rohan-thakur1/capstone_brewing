763,"2017-06-22",3.8,"12 oz. bottle, part of the Beer Camp 12 pack. Poured a muddled mahogany brown with a creamy off white head and some modest lace. Nice, classic Dunkel aroma with wheat, banana and light clove spice. Same can be said for the flavor profile with the addition of just a hint of caramel. Medium bodied with the light spice lingering on the palette. Quite good!","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"
763,"2017-06-21",3.7,"Glassy brick-red color with a slushy collar.

Aroma is sugar plums and stone fruits. Spicy like ribbon candy. The plums and raisins are to die for.

The flavors match the aromas, but more subtly. There is more of an earthy quality, and the yeast is more bready and prevalent. Very mellow flavor.

The feel is chunky and rather dry. This is a very good, dry, mild intro to Dunkelweizens.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"
763,"2017-06-21",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, bottled on 4/25/2017. Pours very hazy deep reddish copper/brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky cream colored head with insane retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts the whole glass. Thick soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Insane appearance. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, wheat, biscuit, light toast/nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, wheat, biscuit, light toast/nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal bitterness and yeast spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, wheat, biscuit, light toast/nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Slightly drying from bitter/spiciness and carbonation as well. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth and creamy/silky/bready mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.7%. Overall this is an incredible dunkelweizen! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink. Extremely flavorful and perfectly balanced between yeast/malt flavors; with an amazing mouthfeel for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, and pristine style example.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

763,"2017-06-11",3.0,"12 oz otter shared by ebone1988 as part of the 2017 Beer Camp set. Bottle #2. Oh yay. The pour is a darker copper brown shit color with a bubbly white ring of head and a few spots of lace. The aroma is sweet caramel malt up front and then the shit just falls apart. The banana and clove are just huge. This is yeasty, malty, lightly sweet, and everything I dislike about hefes. The flavor is even worse. The yeasty banana and clove just punch you right in the mouth. Ugh. The mouth feel is a little viscous and softly carbonated with a lingeringly, nearly offensive clove.

763,"2017-06-09",3.0,"Not a bad Dunkleweizen, but finishes with an off-putting sweetness that almost veers into saccharine territory. Great dunkle nose, deep brown sugar sweetness mixing with clove and notes of musk and vanilla. Pours a hazy chestnut brown topped by a slight beige head and minimal lacing. Taste opens moderately sweet and rich, dark banana-clove wheat mixing with slight black cherry tartness and dried apricot. Backs off somewhat in the middle, adding in grass and yeast, yet the finish mixes a slight smokiness with a sugary, bread-laced finish, turning almost medicinal and cloy once the mild hopping kicks in.
