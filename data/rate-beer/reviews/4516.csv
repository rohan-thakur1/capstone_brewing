The taste is balanced between a flowery maltiness and yoghurty yeastiness.  A very, very good beer and Im so glad Ive tried it.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"

4516,"2008-06-05",3.5,"Draft at Koutland in Plzen.  Cloudy orange/yellow colored body (like hefeweizen) with a white head.  Nose of yeast wheat, full, tart lemon and citrus throughout.  Tastes like a hefeweizen at times, a little too much, only lighter.  A little spritzy, etc, on the palate, but muddled by the yeast, thats easy to see.  Nothing special, but tasty enough.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
4516,"2008-06-03",3.8,"I wish I had taken a picture of this beer.  I mean I took one of about every other one that I had on this trip but again, this was the end of the drinking day for me and I was feeling no pain.  My notes are pretty abrupt with this one. Even and fruity well balanced with some bready yeastyness that is calming.  Semi-hazy. I liked the normal 12 degree and went back to it after fiishing this.  Others dove in to the baltic porter but I was overloaded at this point and ready for an extended nap.  A fine beer nonetheless, and I am fortunate to have had it.","Hippetown East, New York, USA","coldbrewky"
4516,"2008-04-07",3.6,"Back from a Czech Republic pub-crawl this is part of my express ratings for the typical Světlý 11°- (Czech light Pils), Světlý 12°+ (Czech Pils), Polotmavý (Czech Amber Lagers) and Tmavý (Czech Black Lagers).  Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at Koutland, Pilsen, Czech Republic
The look: Partly cloudy golden body with a large white head
To me a typical Czech Světlý 12° and above is: Well malted body with plenty of biscuits and cereals.  Sweetness level is in the light-medium range with some honey flavours and a light caramel presence (3/4 honey, 1/4 caramel).  Fruity flavour limited to a light citrus flavour.  Medium carbonation.  Finish is dry and moderately bitter with a light citric touch.  After-taste of dry grassy/herbal hops with a light dry spiciness character.
This one: As above but with a dusty/floury.  You can feel the extraordinary regular Koutský 12° Světlý Leák in there but this dusty/floury yeast addition brings it down a notch.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4516,"2008-04-04",4.2,"En fût. Pinte dégustée chez Koutland (Plzen, Rép. Tchèque). Arôme: Odeur dagrume et de cérérale. Apparence: La couleur est blonde légèrement orangée avec une faible densité de bulle. Présence dun large col mousseux et dune large dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût de céréale  et dhoublon avec une pointe fruitée. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement onctueuse. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Présence de céréale en arrière goût. (Rating #1550)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
4516,"2008-03-25",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Bready cereals are laden with yeast throughout this fruity and lightly bitter Světlý Leák. The yeast might be a tad too important here, but I wouldnt complain if the filtered 12° werent so mesmerizing.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A full head of foam decorates the hazy orangey blond.
-The fruitiness is pretty much the same as the filtered 12°s in its orangey, tangerine leanings.
-A subtle wooden hop finish helps drinkablity.
-Flavors are not as clearly defined as this beers unfiltered version, but its body, zestiness and quenching factor are all as enjoyable.

4516,"2008-01-31",4.3,"Draught at Koutland, Pilsen. Hazy golden coloured. This has all of the nice aromas and flavours as the filtered version, but with a fruity and slightly yeasty touch. The lack of filtration also makes it slightly softer. A fantastic beer, but the cleaner filtered version is even better.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"
4516,"2008-01-27",3.8,"Draught, Koutland/Plzen.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is hazy light amber.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread/grain), lightly yeasty (dough), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers, herbs, orange), with a note of honey.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Pretty similar to the filtered, just with a touch more yeast character and sourness.  Thankfully that dullish sour tang isnt as marked in this beer as it was in many other cases, but it does make it a bit less enjoyable for my tastes. Still, a terrific beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4516,"2007-10-06",3.6,"Ze sudu v Koutlandu: Golden, creamy, lacing head, aromatic - oaky-hoppy- nose, mixed with some yeasty fruitiness, moderate bitter-sweet flavour, medium-bodied, soft MF, slightly lingering, bitter-oaky finish with traces of sweet pale malt. Very good B.P., but not so impressive as the filtered version............","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
4516,"2007-09-16",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2007 Tap at Koutland. Fantastic head on this one - notes say ""looks like a kvasnicovy"" strangely enough. The same resiny hop aroma as in all the pale Kout beers but accompanied by more peachy/apricoty malt in this one. Solid malt flavour with excellent fruitiness and hop flavour. Bitterness is relatively low, and its relatively light on the sulfury yeast stuff for a kvasnicovy. Very nice beer, but this is one of the few kvasnicovys in the CR which I liked less than the filtered version, but I guess thats because the filtered 12% is so freaking good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

4516,"2007-07-17",4.2,"on tap at koutland. for quite a while i couldnt get too excited about this beer which was quite odd considering how obsessed ive become with kvasnicovy beers and with kout beers. anyways, i think it must have improved appreciably. the first few kegs of this had a decent saaz nose but quite an overwhelming sourdough character which dulled the juicy bitterness of the filtered 12ká. anzways, a balance seems to have been found and this is ripe and pungent with traces of pineapple, lemon zest and a big saaz kick that, as with the other kout beers, reminds me just how little saaz character a lot of czech beers have these days.","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
4516,"2007-06-12",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 10, 2008 Growler. [thank you motelpogo]. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with quite a sparkle to it. Small creamy off white head. Fruity hoppy aroma combined with a heavy dose of the standard Saazer. Flavour though is quite citric sour with a sweet malty centre and a definite dryness to the end. a very different bohemian Pilsner. 7/4/7/3/12
Had it on tap @ Koutland at RBESG08.
Hazy golden with a completely white, creamy head. Okay duration. Aroma has some butterscotch and crisp maltiness with pleasant grassy hops. Super mouthfeel, lightly creamy and grainy. Flavour is a bit of a let-down, softly malty and weakly hopped. The filtered is much better. 7/5/7/3/12","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
