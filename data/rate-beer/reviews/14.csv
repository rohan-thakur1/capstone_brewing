Full-bodied with a 2%-milk mouthfeel and laid-back carbonation. Like the aroma, the flavor is a complex interplay of acidic, herbal and spicy notes flanked by pale malts that provide just enough sweetness to balance things out. Low bitterness.

14,"2012-07-06",3.4,"Tried @ Grain Cru - Roll Out the Barrels, Belgian Beer Café.Second up on the list at an impressive tasting put on by the Grain Cru. This one produced just a shy lighter than the Cellar Door. Still quite hazy in appearance and finely beaded but with little head retention. There is a feint whiff of honey, oak and pale candi amongst a predominately berryish and citric, and wonderfully brettanomyces fuelled, hairy, funk and junk nose. A pronounced sourness drives the palate; quite dry and drawing, vinous and fruitful. Very light bodied, soft and subtle in carbonation which was surprising. Hairy, Brett fuelled; it plays well with the sour berries and fragrant citrus that linger long between swallows. An interesting brew.

Palate is very dry, from the oak barrell aging, and chalky as well.  You get some sweetness from the original beer, but its very dry on the palate and has white wine flavors to complement what was a great saison to start.

14,"2012-05-05",3.9,"750ml bottle purchased at wlv. finally getting around to trying this.... pours a semi-hazy but moderately transparent pale light orange brown hue and topped with a fairly substantial soapy pure white head... sage surfaces first in the aroma but is soon quelled by a semi-tart white wine aromatics, grapey/citrus/pear with a slight hint of mustiness.  sweettarts and smarties follow-up.  clean, somewhat refreshing but the sage is a touch too dominant for my tastes, almost gin-like at times. still nice... flavors are semi-tart, a little earthy which adds texture, white wine focused, with hints of lemon verbena.  sage still makes a presence but not as abundant as it is in the aroma but strengthens as the glass warms to room temps.  a light dry bitterness takes hold on the backend.  body is lightyly airy but maintaining a bit of substance.  id prefer less sage but this is a solid brew all-around - just cant afford them all of the time but somehow find myself spending $10 for a 6oz of mead?...i digress.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Taste is again fruity with great, light tartness, subtle lemony wheat and touch of hop bitterness, brett finish.  Medium palate bright in the mouth.

Flavors are quite a bit different than the nose. Tropical fruit esters, tamarind, papaya, herbal and lightly vinous notes. White pepper, sage, grassy, under ripened pineapple. Feels bigger than 6.8%. Pretty complex, mild acidity, a touch minty. Very lively bubbles, mild carbonic bite. A bit too much carbonation for my tastes. Dry with a very mild tannin.

14,"2011-11-15",3.6,"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a huge white head.  A really funky nose.  Mildly herbal but also slightly tart and lemony.  Theres a nice flavor to it, too.  Somewhat funky, maybe a few herbs, lots of lemon peel, and some earth.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
14,"2011-11-14",3.7,"Thanks to Charlie for sharing this one.  Cheers, sir!  Pours a hazy yellow with a white head.  Nose is some sweet malt with tartness and some oak followed by spice and some vinous character.  Flavor is similar with a medium body and some oaky vinous character in the finish.  Interesting twist on a wit.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
14,"2011-11-12",4.2,"Foamy and hazy orange-yellow pour with a thick fluffy white head.  Very floral and herbal aroma.  Flavor is dry and floral.  Notes of basil, sage, mint, and grapefruit.

14,"2011-11-07",4.2,"Stillwater is knocking everything out of the park for me.  This one pours hazy golden/yellow with a moderate white head that leaves fairly quick and is quite small.  The aroma is flowery, floral, powdery, spicy and lightly tart.  Im guessing the spiciness thats detected is the white sage.  There is only a hint of barrel on the aroma.  There is also some saison earthiness.  Medium / light body that starts with some smoothness, but sharpness from semi-sharp gentle carbonation comes in quickly.  The flavor starts with mild, if any, toastiness of the malt, spice, pepper, red wine hints, mild sourness, husks and mild citrus.  The finish shows more of the wine traits with some tannins and lots of spice.  Great beer.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
14,"2011-11-05",3.8,"Sample at Ale Wine & Spirits in Powell on 11/03/2011. The beer pours a murky straw color with a medium thick white head that recedes steadily to an outer ring. Partial rings of lace on the glass. Yeast and red table wine in the nose. Medium body with a somewhat funky and vinous character, and notes of yeast, herbs and spices. The finish is consists of yeast and fruity esters with a bit of oak left behind. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
14,"2011-11-04",3.8,"Serving: 750 ml bottle from State Line Liquors. It pours a hazy gold with a large white head. The nose is sage, yeast, dough, and dust. The taste is heavy on the sage with a slight minty note, some Brett, spice, yeast, and bread. Nice. Light body with average carbonation. The sage is a little aggressive but its still a quality brew.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"
14,"2011-10-29",3.8,"750ml bottle.

Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a big rocky white head that doesnt leave much lacing but does stick around as a thick cap for the duration.

Aroma has plenty of sage and spicy oak with some white grapes.  The fruity notes from the yeast are really solid but the most interesting part of the nose is probably the emerging funkiness from the wine barrel.

The taste is even more herbal, almost medicinal with the sage and wine barrels dominating.  There are some sweet fruits in the back and, again, there is the light funkiness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is pretty lively with strong carbonation and medium bodied overall.

Stillwater continues to deliver unique saisons with the white wine bringing a distinctive character to this particular brew.  Very well crafted.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
14,"2011-10-22",4.4,"Bottle poured into at tulip glass is cloudy medium yellow with lots of carbonation and a heavy white head.  Aromas are tart, sage, and earthiness with some spice. Taste is tart with some spice, but the sage is much mellower than the original Cellar Door.  Some nice spicy flavors on the back side.  Barrel has produced some nice sourness around the edges.  The brett gives a little funk to the party as well.  The red wine notes are there in the sourness, but not overpowering.  The mouthfeel is clean, short dry finish.  Overall, a remarkable version of a remarkable beer that is one of my favorites from this brewer.  Excellent in many ways.  Well done!","Maryland, USA","hoosiers1994"

14,"2011-10-11",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2012 750mL thanks to brainlayer. The pour is a glowing light golden with a big, white head. Huge effervescence. Good retention and lace. Nose is not very Bretty, More lemonade, chamomile, and mild sage. Taste is lemonade, salty, chamomile, mild tartness. Very refreshing and quenching but losing the sorbet palate I love in normal Cellar Door. Loses peach ice cream character as well. Holding onto a bottle to see what it does. Massive carbonation isnt helping. 7/4/7/4/14=3.6 10/11/2011750mL. Mild GUSHER. Pours cloudy peach with a larger, white head. Webby lace. Amazing pineapple sorbet nose with fresh Brett C and muted white pepper and sage. Wow. Taste is light and quenching with pineapple, pear, oatmeal, honey, herb garden, lavender. Richer, quenching palate. Really beautiful. Has characteristics that remind me of Cabinet Artisanal beers from Terry as well Jolly Pumpkin and Jandrain. Really amazing variant of Brians best beer. This is clearly the first homerun from Stillwater and shows a lot of potential once DOG brewery is ditched.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

14,"2011-10-09",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2011 murky gold, small bubbled white film head. Red wine and yeast combine for lightly vegetal note, but red wine survives, light Brett in pineapple, and it continues to open up as it breathes. Ultra pineapple flavor, faint leather and red wine, light sage lingering, comes together very nicely, carbonation in control, brett just faintest touch.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

14,"2011-10-06",3.6,"Bottle: &nbsp Dirty straw, cloudy, large frothy off-white head, little lacing. &nbsp Bretty nose, a bit woody. &nbsp Faint vinous character, comes across as more white than red. &nbsp Faint tartness up front, a little wheaty, Belgin Witbier like spices are minor, if at all. &nbsp Noticing some vinous character, feeling a bit more Red like than the nose suggested. &nbsp Fairly musty and funky, but not terribly dry or sour. &nbsp Seems to be really missing the core Witbier aspects, in my opinion. &nbsp A little fizzy on the tongue, otherwise body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Faint floral and earthy notes on the finish, soft dryness, a little tart, woody, with some vinous notes. &nbsp Seems to go back and forth between white and red, but perhaps thats just me. &nbsp Interesting beer in its own right, but the Witbier spices are too dull or unavailable. &nbsp Fix that, and then you really have something.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

I cant pick up any (red) wine characteristics... Texture is light and bubbly. Dry...
