Pours cloudy yellow color with a large white head. Nice lemony aroma, lots of wheat and orange notes, moderately hoppy too, some herbal notes. Flavor is wheaty and lemony sour, some hop bitterness, somewhat juicy. Lemon and wheat linger on the aftertaste. Lots of flavor here, overall a very pleasant juicy Wheat Ale with nice refreshing qualities. Has to be one of best Wheat Ales, if not the best Ive tasted, well done.

The bergamot lemon dominates the other flavours, and while refreshing lacks subtlety and depth. 

Edit: Drinking again on the second year, I found it more balanced, not sure if it was me or the beer that changed, but it was a refreshing change of pace mid session.","Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","Hanoi"

1514,"2015-05-05",3.6,"Bottle. Beer Central, Sheffield. Hazy, orange gold. Sudsy, just off white head. Bready. Yeasty. Floral. Citrus hop. Lemon rind. Taste is floral, juicy sweet, quickly turning pretty full on, zesty, pithy bitter. Full body. Mouth filling bitterness. Finishes long, fruity, floral bitter. Super tasty. Maybe a bit too fizzy.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
1514,"2015-04-29",4.0,"Bottle from Mother Kellys. Uber bitter with light yeasty bready funky nose. Big lemon - wow thats something. Bitter herbal character coming through. More fruity bitterness. Hint of sweetness too. Some orange. This is quite a hit. Looks great too. Punchy cloudy orange with big pillowy loose head. Maybe a ball hair too fizzy. Winner.","London, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","chimpgibbon"
1514,"2015-04-28",3.8,"Keg at The Pied Bull, Chester. A cloudy golden colour with a thick fluffy head. Aroma of fresh, zesty lemon, lime and orange, also the bergamot and some bread. Taste again of zesty lemon, sweet orange juice, peach, tea and bready malt. Light bodied but fizzy carbonation. A crisp, clean, zesty fruit finish. Really enjoyed this. A crisp summery beer with nice flavours of citrus and bergamot, a traditional weissbier rival.","Stoke On Trent, Staffordshire, ENGLAND","Towey1989"
1514,"2015-04-28",3.7,"I drank this in the sunshine at our allotment while pulling weeds and planting beetrots. Drinking this beer also taught me two things: firstly that bergamot is a citrus fruit (I thought it was a herb) and secondly that Hopfen Weisse means hoppy wheat beer. As well as being a pleasant summery tipple and an education experience, it was a solid beer.","","Chr0s"
