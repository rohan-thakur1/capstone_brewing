413,"2016-02-07",3.6,"Nitro tap. Clear golden. Easy going going grain nose. Flavor is sweet grainy malt with light honey graham cracker and a light grassy bitterness. Nitro really adds a nice dimension. Wouldnt have thought.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
413,"2015-12-13",3.5,"Tap at OSS. Nitro pour. Clean and easy, not unlike a Boddingtons or similar UK draught. Steady foamy off-white head. Smooth, cream golden malt. A little watery, not much depth. Hyper-sessionable light body. OK. Sublime. Simple. Brewhouse bland aroma. OK.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

413,"2015-07-12",3.2,"On tap. Golden pour with the expected thick head, which does not go away. not much aroma - slightly astringent and floral. Flavor is a good balance of malt and some floral hops. Definitely some resin in the finish. Thick, silky mouthfeel, as expected. Not a huge fan of the style, but good for what it is.","Florida, USA","youdictategood"

413,"2014-09-13",3.2,"Backlog rating on 8-15-2012 at 800 Degree Three Fires (Fort Wayne, IN) This nitro beer pours a lot of foam and then is reduced to a small creamy smooth white head that is fully lasting, transparent yellow body, very little carbonation observed, and a generous amount of lacing adorns my glass. The aroma is biscuits, malt, hops, and a suggestion of fruitiness. The flavor is sweet, malt and mild hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is medium bodied. This beer has mild English hops and is very quaffable.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
413,"2014-04-28",3.2,"[Tap] Pours a clear brown color without much head. Nose is of chalky malts and maybe a hint of nuttiness. Toasted breads, light grass and caramel in the taste. Smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation levels. Nice and sessionable.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
413,"2014-03-02",3.4,"On nitro at WOB. Creamy gold pour with a thick white head. Light earthy citrus hop aroma. Creamy malt body with a touch if hops. Very good.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
413,"2013-01-09",3.1,"Tap. Yellow pour with a monster white nitro head. Slightly bready, mostly a little grassy hop kick late. Easy drinking. Nitro was a good call with this to add a visual and palate element to an otherwise kind of ho-hum beer.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
413,"2012-12-25",2.7,"This draft brew poured a small sized head of cascading foam white colored bubbles that were and left behind a uncarbonated transparent orange colored body and an excellent lacing. The weak aroma was hoppy and malty. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of creamy smooth malt. An OK brew just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
413,"2012-08-24",3.4,"Nitro at Three Fires. Creamy lactic malt aroma. Deep golden with a moderate creamy white head, thick lacing. Biscuity malt with a light grassy hop finish. Medium creamy body, flat carbonation, slightly dry finish. Not bad for a cream ale.","South Whitley, Indiana, USA","queenholly"
413,"2012-07-21",3.1,"Smells like a lager but not much else. Poured on tap golden in color with white nitro thick foam head. Taste nice bitterness, low hoppyness, tastes like a lager not an ale. Medium to thin but the nitro helps thicken it. Not bad but not great.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","burgy"
413,"2012-06-30",3.4,"Not much of a scent on this beer. It has a rather light roast taste and it is pretty creamy. It is really drinkable, nice on a hot day.

413,"2012-03-26",4.0,"On nitro at Stub & Herb's - thick white head that won't go away. Nose is floral hops. Mouthfeel is fantastic, soft and creamy. This is what I imagine an English pub ale should be. A nice balance of malt and bitterness.

413,"2012-02-11",3.0,"Sampled from the tap at the Milwaukee brewpub. Pours a hazy orangish gold with a white head that lasts throughout the beer and laces thickly. Aroma has a light perfume note with a bit of flora and some earthy sweet grains. Flavor was a bit thin with light fruit, sweet grains and a bit of earthy grass.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
413,"2012-01-27",3.4,"On tap at Craft in Middleton, WI - Pours hazy brown with a big fluffy off-white head. Nose is herbal, lightly grassy hops over a lightly toasted malt base. Taste is roughly the same--very smooth malt, lightly toasted and bready, with a herbal, grassy, lightly spicy hop profile. Bites a little bit on the finish. Full and very creamy--mouthfeel is excellent in this one. Wasnt expecting much, but this was pretty impressive.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
413,"2011-12-20",3.5,"Super pale razor-clear amber pour with a perfect creamy nitro head.  Aroma is very light pale malt, a hint of caramel balanced by a mild dry hop resin/wood nose (Fuggles or Goldings?).  Taste is biscuit, grain tannin, woody hop resin, caramel.  Body is medium, super creamy from nitro, mild bitter dry hoppy finish.  Overall, extremely drinkable, best by far Ive had yet form Hinterland.","St. Joseph, Michigan, USA","dumontn"

413,"2010-11-20",3.2,"Tapper was mid-gold color with nice foamy lace.  Aroma was slightly sweet with a malty backbone.  Taste was of malt, some corn/grains, pear hints and a moderate hop finish.  Palate was decent.  Overall, pretty decent, but I was anticipating something smoother and less hoppy for a cream ale.","Town of Maple Creek, Wisconsin, USA","dekester1"
413,"2009-12-07",3.3,"Clear gold orange, creamy white foam.  Aroma is fruity sweet malt.  Taste is a big dulled by the nitro, but a nice solid fruitiness, apples, sweet malts.  Interesting to have a cream ale on nitro.","Capital of Appalachia, Pennsylvania, USA","lithy"
413,"2009-10-26",3.4,"Enjoyed during a closed door tasting session in Green Bay with the brewer, Joe Karls. Poured a clear, gold/amber with an off white, silky, nitro head and a thick, lasting, curtain of lacing. The aroma was slightly bready malt and light fruit sweetness. The flavor added to these a nice subtle hop bitterness, with a pleasant, creamy mouthfeel throughout. Very drinkable and refreshing.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
413,"2008-12-06",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2008 A light golden color with lots of effervescence and abundant amounts of lacing.  Aroma is light floral hops and some light lemongrass along with some mild grain flavor.  Taste is much the same with a bit of cereal grain and fruitiness coming in at the finish.  Nothing exciting but it is an enjoyable beer.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"
