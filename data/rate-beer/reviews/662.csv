The pour is a dark dark brown, with a little ruby or garnet poking through ad a nice darker head. The aroma is great. There is a lot of big caramel malts and a great vanilla and oak character from the barrel. There is a good lick of bourbon on the back end, which I wasnt expecting entirely. The flavor is really good. There is a lot of caramel and dark fruits to go along with a solid vanilla character and an excellent woodiness.

662,"2013-07-24",3.8,"Bottle (2009 vintage drank in 2013): Poured a cloudy dark burgundy color ale with a small dark brown foamy head with light retention and some light lacing.

662,"2013-07-14",4.1,"Green waxed bottle.
Appearance: Deep chestnut with light only visible through edges with a thin light tan head, bubbles are on the edges.
Aroma: Huge vanilla sweetness with strong caramel notes with a mild bourbon backing, hints of oak and fruity undertones.
Taste: Strong syrupy fruit notes on the intro quickly taken over by a strong vanilla with bourbon and oak, while the fruity undertones and sweet caramel underlie it. The finish is of light bourbon with a mild warming sensation and hints of cocoa that linger. Very well balanced, the flavors meld from one to the next very softly.
Palate: Syrupy with light carbonation.

Quite boozy, as usual for a Cigar City barrel aged brew. Very round and flavourful, though not as easy drinking as the regular Big Sound.

A - Pours a dark, dark red body which lets little light through. One fingers worth of khaki foam with really solid lacing and retention and a touch of alcohol legs.

S - Absurd amounts of raisins and dates, sweet caramel, rich toffee and light peat smoke. This is all followed by a strong bourbon presence of vanilla, oak, and butterscotch. Slight alcohol finish. This is incredible, like a rum raisin ice cream.

T - Very sweet raisins, caramel malts and burnt brown sugar. Well integrated butterscotch, vanilla, and oak from the barrel. This is almost overtly sweet though. Comes back to reality on the finish with light peat and some bitterness. For an 8.5%er this seems awfully large and complex. Mouth feel is thick and creamy, just about spot-on.

O - There is a lot happening in this beer. The aroma is pretty incredible but the flavor, despite its huge sweetness is a bit lacking. Perhaps that is due to the 6 month age it has on it. I havent found a barrel aged CCB that hasnt impressed me yet though.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Deep, nearly burnt caramel joins vanilla and Medjool dates in this lovely sipper of a Barrel-Aged Scotch Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam protects the dark brown with ruby highlights.
-Milk chocolate undertones add depth.
-Black bean brownies are alluded to as well.
-Alcohol warmth is present, but never loud.
-This was not one of those severely under-attenuated Cigar City specials. A thing of beauty ! It was even able to hold its own next to Alesmiths Barrel-Aged Wee Heavy

662,"2013-01-23",4.0,"Second base beer from MW.  Shared amongst friends. Drank on  a  9°F evening. Fuck going outside! 751 mL bottle containing dark-blackish cordovan with a fluffy beige head, half a finger in length. Head shrinks to nothing when left alone for more than 20+ minutes. Smells wonderfully of vanilla beans, thyme, bourbon heat, caramel, stingy hops, Ancho chili peppers, pottery clay and cigar smoke. Neat. Tastes malty and spicy showcasing notes of under-ripe clementine, tobacco, figs, steak grease and bar nuts by mid-palate. I let it warm up a bit for 15 minutes, and the results are as follows: fresh nuttiness circling pear skins, leather, cranberries, darkened topsoil, brandy and overripe figs. A tippling alcohol warmth is discovered almost immediately. Vanilla wafers, Edinburgh yeast and noble hops by swallow. Incredibly complex and devious. Likes for its ABV to creep up on you.  Did I mention this Scotch Ale is undeniably sticky? No? Well now I dont have to. There is, as is often the case, a shitload of bourbon in the throat. Needless to say, A LOT better than the primordial example. My only veritable complaint is that the bourbon may be too strong.

662,"2012-08-14",4.3,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  From notes.

Bourbon Barrel Big Sound has a full, opaque brown color in the glass.  There was a tiny head on top after the initial pour, but it faded to nothing rather quickly.  

The nose is a sign of good things to come.  Bourbon, oak, and vanilla gracefully step in brown of caramel, burnt sugar, orchard fruits, and peat.  

Typical Scotch Ale sweetness starts off the flavor, with brown sugar and toffee leading the way.  Quickly the bourbon barrels send the rest of the sip on a less sweet trajectory, smoothing out the sugars with a nice bourbon and vanilla presence.  There is general fruitiness in the middle of the sip that works nicely with the other flavors as well.  Woody oak notes blend well with the peat notes in the original beer.  The end finishes smooth, with the flavors coming together and wrapping up nicely.

Where I may be most impressed with this beer is in the body.  Not only does the beer survive the barrel aging process with its body intact, it actually drinks bigger than the 8.5% that it is.  It seems that instead of wearing away at the body, the barrel aging process only removed some of the sweetness and added a smoothness to the texture that I like.

662,"2012-08-05",3.8,"Thanks to llcooldave for sharing this bottle.

The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma has some cedar notes, but what really comes through is the roasted malt and bourbon. I also get a hint of menthol in the aroma. The flavor is similar. The cedar is once again present, but it takes a back seat to the heavy oak, vanilla and maple notes. There is also a big whiskey character to the flavor, as well as some roasted malt and quite a bit of chocolate. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
662,"2012-08-05",4.4,"Pours a dark amber/chestnut brown color with a 1.5 finger beige head that slowly fades into a lasting ring.  Streaks of spotty lacing left behind.

Nice barrel presence in the nose with dry oak, toasted coconut, vanilla and spicy bourbon.  Doesnt overpower the base beer allowing sweet and roasted malt notes to come through.  Hints of caramel, toffee, hazelnut and chocolate.  Slightly smokey but not acrid or burnt smelling.  Smells great!

Medium bodied with a strong barrel character that adds another layer of flavor to the base beer.  Some dry oak along with silky vanilla, toasted coconut and a delicious spicy bourbon character.  Although the barrel flavors are strong, they are perfectly integrated into the flavor without overpowering the base beer.   Lots of excellent bourbon flavor but barely any heat making it deceptively drinkable.  Underneath the barrel, there is a nice combination of sweet and roasted malt notes.  Slightly smokey with hints of dark chocolate, toffee, caramel and oatmeal lingering into a somewhat dry finish.  Highly recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

662,"2012-06-24",3.3,"Bottle.  Very dark brown.  Not much head.  A rather boozy aroma jumps out of the glass, something I dont remember from when I had it at the tap room.  The aroma also has sweet vanilla and brown sugar elements from the barrel, and the signature dark fruits and rich malts of the scotch ale.  On the palate, this is very sweet, with light fruits and a pretty strong dark malt scotch ale character.  The barrel is all over this beer, with brown sugar and bourbon.  It doesnt taste as hot as it smelled.  The big thing with this beer is that the interaction between the scotch ale and the barrel elements is only okay.  On paper, they ought to be quite cohesive but I dont know if Ive ever really loved a bourbon Scotch Ale before so it might just be something that can only peak so high.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

662,"2011-05-14",4.0,"2009 750 ml bottle, #87 of 246. Aged nearly 2 years. The pour yields a hazy, dark reddish brown brown and topped by a small layer of khaki colored foam  that recedes quickly to a thin leading edge of bubbles. Small patches of lacing cling to the glass and mostly rejoin the body below. The aroma starts off with huge oaky, bourbon notes along with vanilla to go with the big underlying malt bill of sweet caramel, nougat, and cocoa.  Figs and raisins lend a nice earthy, fruity depth to everything. The flavor follows suit with the sweet caramel, nougat, and cocoa as the main component while dark cherries, figs, and raisins add further fruity depth and a nice earthy quality. Vanilla and oak soaked bourbon meld well with the fruits and the melange of malts. The bourbon adds a nice warming quality while the age has toned down the booze from when this was fresh. Nearly full bodied, but thinned a touch from the barrel with a creamy mouthfeel and subtle carbonation that leads to a warming, bourbon soaked fruit finish.  This is a really nice beer that the bourbon barrel has added nice depth to an already good base beer.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

662,"2010-10-23",4.1,"Deep dirty browns, his khaki foamy head recedes into a khaki collar while the middle is marked by random bubble scatterings. When I tease his murky depths, I find lace kindly left behind. Dipping my nose in for the kill, I am suddenly standing before a never-ending supply of caramel nougat truffles dusted with cinnamon powder while rich vanilla perfumes the air. Graham crackers crunch under my watchful nose and bourbon oozes out of the porous wood barrels in which they used to rest. An interesting addition, maraschino cherries flitter about the wood, bourbon, and caramel nougat truffles before one last kiss of treacle brings me into supping beervana. His body is sublimely smooth and marked by creamy sweetness. Toasted marshmallows find themselves right at home with the graham crackers and vanilla while the back of his swallow pierces with heavy caramel sweetness. As I bite into each quaff, I find his soft caramels and cinnamon dusted truffles filled with the richest of bourbons. Slivers of vanilla extract can be found as I dig through each flavorful quaff. Bourbon warms my breath and the gentle dryness of wood settles atop my tongue for that always classic interplay of palate cleansing and thirst inducing pleasures. A beer to be supped slow and at room temperature, I find that the more he warms the more his flavors melt into each other.

662,"2010-01-12",4.0,"750 ml bottle courtesy of either Beerlando or fishingnet. 176/246. I love my CCB Boys! Pours a very dark deep brown, chocolatey with a touch of red, opaque murky, a bit of light with a moderate brownish lighter head. Nice. Aromas are a nice blend of caramel and toffee, biscuits and some light peaty malt coupled with some light Bourbon notes, vanilla, chocolate, sweeter edge on the nose is, frankly, lovely, with the wet oak and peat coming through more noticeably, chocolate chip cookies and caramel toasty malts, this beer is well barrel aged it seems, as alcohol doesnt seem there. Initial is a nice strong brew up front, cocoa, tobacco, caramel, toffee, vanilla, wet oak grows on the tounge, a light booziness is there, but not necessarily all spirit (Bourbon). Chocolate chip cookies, creamy toffee and nougat, a touch of roasty coffee and pretty strong tobacco. The tingling alcohol does grow, a warm rolling heat of the booze is pleasant, doesnt take away from the lovely beer. I must say, the base wasnt one of my favorite CCB beers.. But it certainly is a great candidate for barrel aging. Finish is sweet, bourbon and malts, smooth with a light lingering heat, faint bitterness. Tobacco, cocoa, coffee, toffee, and caramel stick to the palate, really coat. A winner. Glad I have another.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Pours dark brown in the glass with some mahogany hues coming through around the edges.  There is a very small tan head that recedes very quickly, leaving a small collar and a swirl of bubbles along the top.

Much like the regular version, Im not overly impressed with the nose as its fairly faint and mostly sweet caramel malts and brown sugar.  The bourbon is present but definitely not overpowering.

The taste is markedly better than the aroma for me as the malts take on a more smoked peat character in addition to the caramel sweetness.  There are dark fruits, raisins and figs, in the middle before the bourbon makes an appearance in the finish leaving a nice burn going down.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with soft carbonation and very smooth.  Though the smoked peat lends a slight dryness to the finish, its still a sweet, sugary feel on the palate.

This is a step up from the regular Big Sound for me as the bourbon brings an extra complexity to the taste without being the dominant component.  Very nice.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
662,"2009-09-19",3.2,"[Bottle] shared by Skyview. Pours a cloudy brown with almost no head. Aroma is the usual suspects, vanilla, caramel, alcohol, coconut, oak, and cocoa powder. Flavor is cardboardy oxidation, some smoke, light carbonation, some sweetness.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"
662,"2009-09-19",3.9,"Thanks to Skyview for sharing.  Sweet bourbon aroma - more of a port character than anything else.  Hazy bron color.  A light bourbon character with some oak funk coming through on the finish.  Mostly fruity malts in the flavor.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"

662,"2009-09-13",4.0,"Missed the release but thanks to the CCB boys for taking care of me! Bottle 75/246

A: Pours a very dark amber hue, more brown than red. Nice tall creamy tan head that rises to a full finger. Excellent retention with tons of thick sticky lace. CCB beers really are beautiful in the glass.

S: Wonderful aromas. Lots of toffee, brown sugar, loads of caramel malt. Lots of barrel as well. Old oak, vanilla, and hints of booze.

T: Pretty damn drinkable for a BA brew. Lots of malt sweetness. Toffee forward, brown sugar, and sweet molasses. Hints of apple and dark fruit in the middle. The finish is about the barrel. Not over the top at all, just subtle oak, vanilla, and a touch of booze which compliments the base beer nicely.

M: Medium in body, smooth mouthfeel.

D: Pretty good actually. Not the best barrel aged CCB brew, but the barrel did improve an already solid base brew!","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"

The almost over-the-top sweetness of regular BS seems fit just a hair more with the smooth bourbon/vanilla profile the barrel lends.

The unbarreled version didnt strike me as particularly sweet, but this comes across as pleasantly sweet with caramel, oak, bourbon, vanilla, hints of cherries and dates, some chocolate, lots of malt. Drying sensation from barrel tannins and the alcohol, quite lush, lots of small bubbles, not syrupy. The barrel served this well!","San Francisco, California, USA","cmillward"
662,"2009-08-05",4.4,"22oz wax sealed bottle (#60). Pours a burnt mahogany, relatively clear. Big foamy off white head. Nose is huge caramel and bourbon notes. A bit of wood and a whiff of smoke. Flavor is very bourbony up front but recedes enough to let the scotch ale breathe. Caramel and chocolate dominate this version where the fruitiness of the normal big sound is more subdued here. Less fruit esters and more complex malt. Finishes with a slight cherry pit and big caramel flavor. Slightly warming with a touch of sweet bourbon. Another terrific barrel aged beer.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
662,"2009-08-05",4.5,"Damn.  This is good.  Real good.  Very sweet, though.  Like a dessert, but not overly sweet that you cant easily drink an entire bottle on your own.  The bourbon barrel aging almost adds a more caramel maltiness to the already malty scotch ale.  A lot of toffee, caramel, brown sugar and milk chocolate on top of a malt bomb.  Theres a little oak and the bourbon is sweet and accentuates everything.  This is amazingly good and easy to drink.  This would be on my Top Ten list for beers to drink for the rest of my life.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"

662,"2009-08-02",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2009 Quaffed (THIS WAS NEVER ON DRAFT) at CCB BA Big Sound release party. Big thanks to Justin for opening his bottle. It pours murky dark brown  amber with copper edges and lasting tan head. The aroma is bourbon  whiskey notes and some heat to go along with modest sweet maltiness. The taste is sweet malty and chewy with a brief pulse malt roastiness before layers and layers of bourbony booze barrel notes well up to the surface. To midway and toward the finish I get thin mesas of chocolate, some dark roasted coffee and mildly drying roasted malts and booze.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

662,"2009-08-02",4.0,"750ml bottle cracked by jdubfl.  Thank bro!  The pour yields a dark and hazy plum-brown colored body with a small layer of whipped, khaki tinted foam.  Little splotches and dots of lacing mark the glass.  The nose kicks off with a big, woody bourbon overtone that really compliments the underlying malt collage, notes of nougat, caramel, cocoa, figs and raisins all lending rich, earthy, fruity depth.  Though it is warm and a little boozy in its youth, the bourbon flavors massage the cocoa and stewed dark fruits well.  The lingering finish offers notes of dark cherry, vanilla, and oak.  Though its been thinned a bit by the barrel, the palate is still quite lush, with a distinct creaminess and a warming, sherry-like finish.  Excellent brew, though I must say I preferred the regular version on cask a bit more.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
