820,"2016-11-01",3.5,"Bottle. Enormous thanks to Ivan R. & Mirna for sharing! Really glad to finally tried this one. Memorable name, funny from a Croatian perspective in more ways than one (so are plenty of things here for Czechs, so dont worry, its reciprocal). Ahaaanyway, poured a misty golden body with a good thick white head. Pungent aroma, lemony and herbal notes, ending dry. Huge herbal and nicely fresh lemony taste, vague grapefruit and/or lime notes perhaps, its a mixed bag in that manner. All in all, nicely citric. Ends with solid, quality bitterness.

820,"2013-03-11",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Earthy, leafy hops are balanced out by silky honeyed malts while orange-y fruitiness adds depth to this polished brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam floats atop the misty amber.
-This tastes and feels like a well tendered cask ESB.
-Drinkability is quite high despite the hoppy intensity.
-Mouthfeel is healthy ; not dry, but not too sweet either.
