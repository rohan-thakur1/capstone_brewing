922,"2016-12-07",3.7,"aroma of grapefruit, orange and papaya. appearance is a browish orange that pours a finger of head that recedes into a thin sheet with a thicker mass of foam in the center. taste is grapefruit, orange, papaya, green hops, caramel and a mineral /earth quality. Palate is thin bodied with a lightly bitter finish. Overall a tasty and well balanced beer. Probably a bit on the hoppy side for your average California Common but quite tasty nevertheless.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","rubyroo"

922,"2016-08-09",3.7,"Bomber from BC Liquor store in north Burnaby. A dark orange amber beer with generous beige head and citrus hop nose. Superficially this beer is at first reminiscent of a typical west coast IPA, but as the hop impression fades, the malt background suggests something different from an ale - a lager, and a good one at that! 3.7","British Columbia, CANADA","stantheman"

922,"2016-04-07",3.4,"Can. Medium amber, clear, with an eggshell head. Pleasant, bright citrus hop character, leaning toward lemony, with underlying light fruity caramel. Moderately bitter finish. This is more of an APA with its assertive hop character and firm bitterness, but I enjoyed it regardless.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

922,"2015-06-18",3.2,"Sampled during VCBW 2015 on the PNE grounds pouring a copper color with a finger of white head that leaves some spotted lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild grains and light spices with a hint of citrus. Taste is a spicy, grassy hop bitterness with a light malty sweetness. Grainy mouth feel. Light bodied with abundant carbonation. One of the better California Commons that I have tried.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"

922,"2015-05-13",3.2,"On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a hazy copper orange with a medium beige head. Nose brings out notes of toasted malt mostly. Flavour is quite good for the style, with toasted malt, bready notes, and an ever so slightly sweetness on the finish. Well-balanced and much more interesting than most California commons. Good stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
922,"2015-04-18",3.6,"650 ml bottle. Pours a hazy copper color with light head. Aromas of doughy malts and fruity hops Flavors of bitter orange, mashed fruit, pine and toasted malts. Sharp bitter finish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Gerbeer"
922,"2015-03-25",3.9,"Draft, Sportstown. Hazy light amber. Thick head. Fresh fruity hop nose. On the palate, more hop. I really hope F&W can sort out their supply chain, to get the cool hops that they do in greater quantities. I worry about that. Because using fun hops is pretty much their signature. They can call it a ""common"" but itÂ’s an APA, and a good one, with the fresh, fruity hop and sweet pale malt.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
922,"2015-03-21",3.4,"Amber,small beige head.Light hop nose.Nicely balanced palate,hops with good malt backbone. Big,lasting hop bitterness in finish.","Surrey, British Columbia, CANADA","Crit"
922,"2015-03-20",3.9,"Draught at Sportstown, Richmond; 16ozCloudy light amber color with a dull hue, creamy head. Good body strength, good malt backbone, a bit of cereals, with light residual sugars, a clean touch from the Lager yeast, and a truckload of hops; very resiny hops, lightly fruity; this one is an IPA with a different malt and yeast profile. Hop soup.I came here skeptic, but this is very interesting. Brutal though.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
