3124,"2017-03-09",4.0,"Draught at EBF Pre-Fest party at Eataly, 2/2/17.Lightly to minimally hazy, bright goldenrod-brass body is topped by a good-sized white head that slowly fades to cover.Brett adds plentiful lime, light band aid and lots of sweat in the nose, as the funk slowly deepens as it breathes. Lactic and very light acetic acids provide a ""lambic-y"" character, though it still smells a bit more like an American Wild ale than true lambic. Lots of oak, though its not overdone, with vanilla, light wood and plentiful malt behind it. No alcohol or flaw.In the mouth, Im immediately surprised at how malty it is. Not too sweet, but definitely one of the sweeter wild ales Ive had in a while. Tons of rich honey mixes with moderate oak, Brett-derived citrus and tropical fruits and a bit stronger lactic-acetic acidity on the finish. Soft, malty texture with tight carbonation and no alcohol or flaw. Rating is against a ""American Sour/Wild"" not a Belgian Lambic.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3124,"2016-10-18",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this during the 2nd Annual Kellys Island Bottle Share on September 18. 750 mL bottle. Batch 3. The pour is a nice clear darker golden yellow with a thick, bright white head that falls down quickly. The aroma is really nice. There is a great citrus, apple skin, and funk right up front. There is a lighter dusty barnyard and a hint of horse blanket that rolls in on the finish. Its just a little too acidic. The flavor is awesome. The white wine is light and crisp with a lovely citrus sourness. There is a lightly acidic gueuze that lasts for days. The funk and apple skins are really good, and the dustiness swells a little more than Id like. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a great carbonation and a lingeringly tart and funky finish. This is really good, but I wish it were more citrus based on the sour.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3124,"2016-10-12",4.3,"Lost Abbeys famed sour ale, a coupage of young and old beer, only released for a couple of times and a tribute to Belgian lambic culture. Shared by 77ships at Hopishops B.U.M.B., thanks! Lightly lacing, medium sized, egg-white head quickly thinning, hazy golden blonde robe. Beautiful aroma of sour cream, unripe gooseberry, wild apples, unsugared yoghurt, limoncello, damp hay, pickled apricots, dry white wine, stale sweat, wet wood. Lemony sourness in the onset, lots of green berries and unripe stonefruit, green apple, even red wine vinegar-like, very light salty touch somewhere, lightly bready, pleasantly fluffy middle, a tad soapy, smooth and perfectly dried by the ongoing sourness which becomes softer and more lactic and yoghurty towards the end, where it meets drying wood tannins and a spicy phenolic accent. Its easy to see the hype here, this is among the most gracious, elegant and rich examples of new Anglo-Saxon sour ale I had so far - but it clearly is not a lambic.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Pours a hazy amber-yellow color with a small, fizzy white head, which leaves back no trace.

Smell is old potatoes, glue, blue cheese, bright and crisp citrus peel with a soft, flowery note to it and a slightly acetic tartness. Very well balanced, not pungently sour, while producing a nice, funky blend. Got some wet hay on top of its aroma foundation with dried tomatoe bush, adding a light herbal complexity to the nose. 

Has a lower to medium carbonation, complimenting perfectly to the refreshing, tart, yet complex and balanced beer.

Tastes of fresh squeezed lemon juice, accompanied by a funky mushroom quality and a soft mineral aspect. Its mid palate produces a wood bark covered acetic sourness with a hint of white grape skin to it. This results from a sugary malt sweetness, which becomes recognizable only as a minor note against the omnipresent sourness, while being able to cut through it. Finishes utmost soft, very silk with a pungent, dry acetic tone among lemon zest, and leathery, matured oak, still carrying its subtle grape flavor. 

Wow, this is pushing AWAs to a new level for me. This is balanced and complex like no other American sour Ive had so far. It got the typical vinegar sourness, which is dominating in many examples of american sours. This is different though, its acetic flavor is setting the balance in this, which to me is remarkable by itself, since it allows a pungent, refreshing lemon sourness to open up the palate to many flavor layers, creating an intriguing complexity which at no point gets boring.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Pronounced aromas of oak, honey, white grape and honeydew play about my nose, along with soft grapefruit and wet cement. Flavor lead with lemon, apricot and white vinegar followed up with honey-like sweetness and truffles. The tartness is intense and lingers long after the swallow. Gentle fizz, with a fairly creamy medium body. A slight alcohol warmth travels down the throat. Thanks to an epic beer tasting lineup, I was able to enjoy this brew directly after Isabelle Proximus. Comparing the two, Id call this the more ""incomplete"" beer. It had a more unique flavor bill, but seemed slightly less well-mingled. Still a world-class sour, though.","","PartyFowle"

3124,"2014-10-12",4.4,"This rating is for a bottle of the original vintage. I had originally acquired about 4 or 5 of these at the initial brewery launch, which over the years have been shared with friends or traded away for other rarities. The beer seems to have changed for the better with age. A deep gold color is capped with a light ring of white bubbles and the carbonation is still holding up. The aroma is fantastic; notes of moldy blue cheese, musty barnyard wood planks, ripe lemon and orange zest, oak barrel and a smell of old earth you experience when you turn over a big stone in a wet grassy field. Really outstanding. Flavor is sour and bitter throughout with smooth transitions between oak wood, yeast biscuit, sour wild bugs, fresh cut hay and sour apple. Acidity is mild with the carbonation propelling a lasting flavor on the finish. Light and drinkable texture on the palate. 
After being part of many of the first tastings, brewery releases and special events at Lost Abbey just shy of a decade ago, this beer evokes memory of a time when this was just a fledgling establishment, when their spin-off from Pizza Port and brewing creativity was beginning to push San Diego beer in a new direction. While many things have changed since then and have undoubtedly become more commercialized, competitive and mass-produced, beers like this still make me respect what it takes to replicate an old world style. Heres to the folks over there on the hop highway to never forget how you started, and most importantly, remember quality over quantity.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

The appearance isnt impressive ; the aroma didnt overly impress either. The flavor profile (I found) was stunning. Initial light bitter, tart, somewhat puckering - and it reveals a depth of character after a touch of warmth from the original pour.

3124,"2012-11-10",3.5,"750ml bottle thanks to one of you. I came into this expecting a gueuze and I will review it as such. Bright orange color with almost no head at all but it is carbonated. Smells sour and a bit cheesy but i would not say funky at all. In fact this does not smell like a true gueuze at all. The taste was way too sweet and then followed by a sourness. The sweetness was almost like a pixie stick or sweet tart and I didnt like that aspect at all.There was some citrus and fruit but to call this a gueuze is just not being honest. As a wild ale this was ok but the price was completely out of line for the beer that is in the bottle. Save your money and get a Cantillon for half the price.

Citrus fruit, celery salt and white wine vinegar are awash in acidity, while chewy wheat succeeds in providing diversity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy blond.
-The nose on this one is as intense as a Hanssens Oude Gueuze, to give you an idea. Maybe not as complex, but thats quite the aromatic wallop nonetheless!
-The soft, natural carbonation helps the mouthfeel greatly.
-Drinkability is quite low because of the acetic intensity.
-The finish lasts as long as their Framboises (which is very intense).

The flavor follows suit and does not disappoint in the least with huge notes of soured apricots and peaches along with grapefruit like acidity that is assuaged by the soft oak and the musty, funky yeast. The citrus acidity is mouth puckering at points, but never overbearing as the oak, vanilla, and funky yeast keep things dry and in check. Medium to full bodied with subtle yet persistent carbonation that enhances the citrus acidity and also bone dry thanks to the funky yeast profile. The palate is just perfect with the rich amount of heft and the classic lambic like dryness. This is just delicious stuff and I am anxious to see how it does with some more age on it. This is a truly masterful creation and a world class effort from Tomme and the Lost Abbey. Awesome stuff and one of the best beers Ive ever tried.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3124,"2012-02-03",4.3,"DDG pours a hazy golden color.  It honestly looks like apple juice.  No head is poured and no lacing.  There are bubbles that shoot from the bottom of the glass to the top.  Of course as you get deeper and deeper into the bottle that clearness goes away and becomes cloudy.

Smell is all the way tart apples.  Its the number one thing I noticed.  Tartness and sourness mixed together wonderfully.  I also picked up some lemon, grass, citrus, and oak. 

The taste is more sour than I remember.  It could be because of some of the age.  This time around while my girlfriend liked it she didnt quite love it.  I ended up finishing almost the whole bottle by myself.  I never have issues really finishing a whole bottle but when there is a sour ale involved it eventually gets pretty damn puckering.  The sour and tart apples once again take front stage followed by barnyard funk, lemon, citrus, and a oaky finish.  If I could describe this beer to someone I would say its Acidic, tart, funky, sour apple juice mixed in with wine like qualities.

Pour is a funky Belgian lemonade with some creamy white foams forming a pretty hat on a pretty beer.  Smells like an old lemon jam. Lots of cobwebs and dusty old oakiness that gets me excited. Taste is musky old lemon, tart with a slight citrus vinegar. Not a lot of cheesiness in this one, as its very clean. Some vanilla helps make the taste memorable, but really this is a very clean and crisp tasting wild ale. The lemon is musky as can be, an old lemon with all the vibrancy of a fresh one off the vine. The feel is effervescent with a slow but consistent release of bubbles. This is amazingly drinkable, but I wouldnt have minded even more tartness. This beer might be going through a subdued phase.

The aroma is pretty light for a wild ale with mostly a light sour funk to it. Its on its way to being a crazy strong horse blanket but jusnt get you there. Some might like the lighter aroma as it wont turn them off, but I was looking for a tad bit more pugency. At the end there is some light wood. 

For the reasons I didnt like the aroma a ton, I love the taste. It is sour enough to give me the pucker and sensations that I love about wild ale but its just light enough to make it very drinkable. The biggest complaint is that the flavor isnt complex just sour through and through.

3124,"2010-11-27",4.4,"Purchased at the Pizza Port Carlsbad back in early August. Sampled on September 15, 2009.

A: Beautiful golden, tawny apricot color with a fairly long-lasting bone-white head. The initial head on a semi-hard pour into my tulip glass was a little over an inch, and it has settled down to a little over a quarter of an inch. Rich effervescent bubbles immediately after the pour settle into a mild vertical flight of carbonation as the brew settles. The lacing clings mildly as I quaff the beer down.

S: A prickly sourness is the most apparent scent upon first sniff. As I bring the glass back for another whiff, I smell sweet Meyer lemons alongside sour green grapes and a few tropical notes. Theres also a slight oakiness, which I gather will assert itself further as the beer warms from fridge temperature. As it warms, there is a little more of a slightly funky earthy aroma. 

T: As with the nose, there is a mouth-puckering tartness as I take my first sip; it takes my mouth a moment to adjust, and my eyes have gotten a little watery. While Im certainly no sour expert, I wouldnt recommend this as a beginners wild ale. As I get further into the glass I can detect a lot more--the lemon is much less pronounced in the taste, and coming further is more of a Granny Smith-type sourness.

M: The tartness is obvious and the first sip made my lips pucker and left my cheeks quite dry; the dryness subsides as my palate becomes more accustomed to the beverage, but the refreshing acidic tartness remains throughout. The carbonation is fairly light, which is very nice and refreshing on what is hopefully one of the last hot days here in Northern Virginia. My biggest complaint is that this is something my taste buds were able to adjust to a little too much, as the last sip wasnt nearly as puckering as the first couple. Also, while not a style that needs plenty of carbonation, this one could use a tad bit more.

D: Drinkability is quite high; as I took my second sip, I was saddened by the fact that I had only another 700 mL or so of this tart, puckering nectar. While this may not have been the kindest year to Lost Abbey, Duck Duck Gooze is certainly making the brightest impression upon me.

It has the trademark of LA and is classic in that way - but damn its nice in a simpel way. Really drinkable  - I want more. Who has these bottles. Ship em over","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"
3124,"2010-07-26",4.0,"Beautiful golden yellow pour with a thick and full white colored head, that fades into thick lacing, carbonation is about perfect for the style. Aroma was lemon zest, shaved vanilla, and hints of grapefruit and grass. Upon first sip there is a very sharp and tart lemon  profile, followed by a slight sweetness and finally horseblanket funk on the finish. Very acidic, anymore so and this beer would be too harsh. This one definatley walks the fine line of something wonderful and an epic mess of a beer...still though Lost Abbey pulls this one off pretty well. Not nearly as well rounded as true Gueuze but done fairly well.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

3124,"2010-06-11",3.4,"750mL Bottle. Many thanks, Andy, Im very grateful for your generosity. Well-yeasted and musty nose, with obvious acidity and a decent range of Belgian bug products. Pours a evenly hazed orange-gold, with a clean white rim. Flavors are strong and complex, if a little uneven. The acidity is incredibly strong, pointed, and sharp, out balance, really. This is not the soft, elegant acidity of a mature Belgian example, but the brash mineral-laden, multi-bug acidity of an overly-aggressive American brewer. Oak weaves in and out and a milk-like yeastiness pops up from time to time. The lambic-like signature character is there, but it ebbs towards acetate and scotch tape at times. Long oaky dryness in the backend. All I can think is that it doesnt measure up to most Belgian lambics. It could use some elegance and refinement.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3124,"2010-06-11",3.6,"On tap at Capones. Tangerine body, thin white head. Nose of peach and pale malt, heavy funk, and a bludgeon of acidity, overwhelmingly so. The flavor is balanced between tart fruits and pale malt, but again, finding these among the vinegar is damn tough. The Lost Abbey yeast definitely shows up somewhere in there, reminiscent of Yellow Bus. This burns the back of the throat and coats the lips. Not for the faint of heart. Actually very similar to YB except that the acid here is off the charts and the peach relatively absent.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

3124,"2010-04-18",4.2,"750mL bottle poured into a tulip.

Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a surprisingly small bubbly white head that dissipates quickly to a small collar fed by stray bubbles floating up from the bottom.

The aroma starts with a light lemony tartness but that is overshadowed by the funk from the brett, which manifests itself in the nose as wet hay and old leather.  There is also some tart green apples coming out as it warms and tones down the funk.

The taste just completely puckers my mouth on the first sip, massive fruity tartness coupled with barnyard funk.  There are some candied pears and bread and dough in the background but the finish brings back the tartness and some dry oaky tannins.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated with an overall sour tartness from start to finish.

This is another excellent sour from LA and one that surely stacks up against some of the best out there, American or Belgian.  Super drinkable, plenty of fruit but with a tag-team combo of funk and lactic/acetic sourness that really comes together well.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Flavor was followed aroma exactly, medium/strong sourness with crisp tartness, some residual sugar fills it out in conjunction with the pronounced but sophisticated soft barrel/vanilla... hint of cheese, very very nice, would love to try it in 2 years.

3124,"2009-12-31",4.3,"750mL bottle. Pours a hazy, honey-golden color; creamy white head with good retention and fine-bubbled lacing; very nice-looking pour. Pleasantly complex, funky, cobwebby aroma here: lots of tart citrus, gueuze-like notes of brett and aceto and mildly husky wheatiness; the complexity of the nose is much more significant than in mouth, certainly: generous funk and sourness and lemony notes; really lovely, and reminiscent of Isabelle. I was heavily concerned by some peoples notes regarding the complexity of this beer: it really is lacking the intricacy and subtle malt and funk complexity at the core of many great lambics, but its not like this is claiming to be anything other than an off-key homage to those beers (and it shouldnt matter anyway): this is delicious. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lots of lemony and citrus tartness, cobwebs and a light woodiness, alongside some husky wheat character (a good sign) and plenty of well-developed funk; mouthwatering, medium-to-high acidity, and lots of funk; the sourness and acidity here really builds halfway into the glass: while this doesnt have the complexity of something like Blauw or Isabelle, it is gorgeous and nicely done, with some white wine vinous notes appearing, soft vanilla barrel character, and plenty of citrus through everything; a really nice, well-developed and heavily soured ale. Lasting finish of funk, citrus, brett and aceto and scraping wheat notes; very nicely dry and long-lasting funk. A very delightful, gueuze-like sour ale.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

The pour was hazy golden yellow to amber-ish, nice white soda-poppy type head, ok lacing. The aroma was full of sawdust, fresh from the chainsaw, lighter fruits of white grapes, apples, some lemons, all supported by a wheaty and funky base. The flavor was all of that with the sawdust melding more subtly with the other action going on. Other notes of light phenolic, spice and yeast may have been there too, differing on each sip. This thing was highly drinkable, not a mouth puckering gueuze, but certainly sour with lambic qualities. The carbonation was fine by me, but perhaps a tad ligher than other gueuzes, although sloth was wanting more of it for sure. Otherwise, the mouthfeel was as expected for the style.

3124,"2009-11-25",3.5,"hazed glowing yellow body, small white head.  intensely strong nose of sulfuric and fatty lacto, strongly and excessively caustic.  what seems like caproic and isobutryic acid are both far too strong, giving it that sweaty, fatty and rancid scent that tends to play nice when its produced at a level low enough that the malt and wheat and especially the brettanomyces can play a little more.  instead its overtly lactic and reminds me of moldy pineapple and rubber.  not to say its bad, it just fits so perfectly into this new world lambic/sour paradigm that US brewers seem to like - make the beer more accessible to american palates by forgoing nauce and complexity and wow the audience with bigger, bolder, more acidic brute force.  its overly acidic and overly citrus-like without the roundness and delicateness of a true belgian lambic.  its a clever trick, really, and kudos for them for knowing their customers and knowing what will grab their attention.  for the rest of us, this beers comes across as an adolescent grasp for attention, a loud and ugly display of beefy, fatty sourness with subtlety, nuance and most-importantly flavor all suffering.  the characteristic lost abbey filmy and waxy texture of their yeast is noticeable, though thankfully its less of a nuisance than in beers such as proximus, vertias 4 and red poppy.  still it tends to muddle this beer and mask what may be a more interesting beer were it not so turbid (and this after being extremely careful with the pour, knowing how easily lost abbey yeast can neutralize the beer).  overall an interesting beer that falls short of what I would consider good, but at this point I know that Im not the intended audience.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased mail order from Geoi at South Bay in Imperial Beach, California.  Cork opens with a soft pop. Served out of the wine fridge at approximately 55 degrees in my Boulevard Saison tulip. Pour is mostly clear golden with a one inch white head that falls quickly. There is visible fine carbonation bubbles descending in a column from the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is soft tart lemons, bright acidity, gentle oak vanilla  and a nice funkiness layered on top of all of that. Soft, tart, complex, inviting nose.  Taste is leathery funkiness, followed closely by the tart lemon, there is a sweetness to the taste that is reminiscent of lemon sugar. In the back, the oak wood vannilla taste is pretty bright, and transitions smoothly from the funk and tart at the front. As with the nose, the taste is soft and quite well integrated. Palate has active
carbonation, sharp acidity, and drying in the finish.  Mouth watering tartness - makes another sip a requirement. Really nicely done.  I picked up on the oak more this time around, otherwise similar to how I remember.  (8,4,9,4,18 - 4.3)

3124,"2009-09-09",4.4,"Young 750ml bottle, courtesy Morgan Fishback.  Each pour yields a progressively more hazy, golden-orange hue to the body.  A small, foamy, snow white head rests at the surface.  Lacing fails to harden, a soap wash quickly rejoining the pool below after each sip.  The aroma is just what I was hoping for, a very lambic-like profile of fruity, citric acidity and funky barrel notes.  Soured apricot and nectarine are prominent, as are tart grape skins, kumquat, soft oak, and something I can only describe as ""clean barnyard"" air.  Having alot to live up to, the flavor does not disappoint.  Big apricot and juicy grapefruit acidity are massaged by soft, supple oak, with a musty yeast profile that mirrors that of some of the Payottenlands finest.  Simply stated, the palate is perfect.  Deliciously dry, with puckering citrus acidity, theres just a hint of residual sugar that serves to lend a bit of welcomed heft.  Carbonation is soft, yet persistent, steadily pushing the tartness towards the back of the tongue.

Flavor is initially quite salty, which is my overall complaint with Vereitas 004, but it quickly melds into a very nice progression into a full peachy note.  Very sour and tart, and a very well-intregrated funky brett.  I like this quite a bit.  I disagree that it cant stand up to classic Belgian lambics, as it is more robust and full in my opinion.

3124,"2009-08-24",4.2,"A solid Pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a frothy, two-finger thick, pale, almost white head.  The beer is a murky, pale amber color that shows quite a bit of haze (much is a chill haze as it was clearer at room temps) and a rich gold color when held up to the light.  I only let this sit for just under two weeks (I couldnt wait any longer), so this was still a touch hazy even before I chilled it down.

The aroma has a tart lemon like bite to it up front but finishes with a distinct tropical fruit and even more pineapple notes at the backend of the aroma.  Musty, damp cellar notes mix with a musky, phenolic soaked moldy cotton, sweat stained well worn leather character are a sure Brettanomyces signature.  There is a touch of toastiness here that seems to be contributed by both oak and grain; the latter also produces some saltine cracker notes I cant get away from the fruitiness here, while it is not overwhelming (the lactic contribution is probably the most dominant in this complex nose, but not by much) and even a touch subtle, it is quite distinct from say a Belgian Lambic; tropical fruit, with a touch of green apple at times can be quite distinct at times, though at others it can be quite fleeting too.  As the beer warms a sort of unripe, green fruit character seems to get accentuated, some how it reminds me of nopalitos (prickly pear cactus paddles ready for cooking).

My first sip is puckeringly tart, but there seems to be a hint of sweetness to this brew too (though perhaps this is just perceived from a soft acetic character).  Subsequent sips lose the shocking sourness but retain a robust, amply tart lactic acid component that dominates the flavor profile.  The body is quite full for something that is so dry and I am sure much of it is contributed by tannic oak and the lactic slickness that is found in significantly sour beers.  There is a buttery note here that I at first thought might be some residual diacetyl, but I am not convinced it is more likely oak derived; in fact I am pretty sure of this.  Despite being quite sour, there is still a lot more going on here; spicy oak notes, a solid virgin oak stave woodiness, a touch of urea, maybe a hint of an acetic bite (actually as this warms I think this becomes more apparent, though it is nothing more than a background note), maybe a touch of green apple, .  There is a touch of astringency and sharpness to the finish that seems to leach into the oral-nasal cavity and the roof of my mouth after a sip as passed down my throat.

My second pour of this beer is, unsurprisingly, a touch more hazy.  Underneath the ever present acidity there is a soft Brettanomyces influenced funk; layers of mustiness, definite phenolic notes that dont quite reach curing plastic levels as well as a hint of musky, sweat dried, abused blankets that become a touch more apparent towards the finish.  

I could drink a lot of this beer.  The aroma is nicely complex and though the flavor could be a little bit more so, it is still a fine tipple overall.  This substitutes very nicely for a traditional Belgian-sourced Lambic and I so wish I had a bunch of bottles of this.  For those who like a more integrated faux Lambic, this beer will be enjoyed a bit more than the fresh Isabelle Proximus.  Comparing these fresh though, I liked the additional complexity of the Isabelle Proximus (funkiness and oak were more prominent in the first beer released).  This is still quite a fine beer though and it serves as proof that the funky beers at Lost Abbey are still strong and full of life.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3124,"2009-08-13",4.4,"Rating #900!  Thanks to Nick3 on BA for bringing this elusive bastard to a tasting.  Best beer of the night out of 20+, just edging out the likes of Valley Brew Uberhoppy and Rasputin XII.  This is Tommes way of reminding you that hes a really damn good brewer just when youre about to throw yourself off a building because you paid $30 for an uncarbonated bottle of Angels Share.  Anyway, the beer pours a nice hazy golden-straw color with a white head.  Aroma of lemony funk, barnyard, wood, and a little sweet malt.  Flavor has a nice lemony tartness balanced by a malty sweetness and some light fruits.  Not too sour, great balance.  Palate incredibly sharp,biting, and lively with high carbonation.  Awesome beer all around.  Even the people who werent sour fans liked it.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
3124,"2009-08-12",3.8,"This poured a hazy straw yellow color with a white head. Aroma was very tart lemongrass, and funk. Flavor was very mouth puckering, some wet barn and funk and lemon and peaches as well. A very good beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
3124,"2009-08-11",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 23, 2009 Had this one at the RB Pittsburgh tasting.  I cant say enough positive about this one.  Lost Abbey has come under some fire in recent time for their botched AS release, as well as complaints about pricing, but Ill be damned if this isnt one of the best beers I have ever had.  Had this one at the RB Pittsburgh tasting, and for me, this was the highlight of the day.  Amazingly sour, citrus sweetness, medium body, high carbonation.  Incredible blend.  Cant wait to try it again.  One of my favorite beers in one of my favorite styles.

EDIT:  Full glass notes:  Murky orange/yellow liquid with a nice one finger of foamy off white head.  Scent is light funk, sour fruit.  Taste is such a good mix of sour and sweet.  I get lemon, maybe a very very light peach.  Mouth is thin to medium in body and very high in carbonation.  A fantastic sour.","Donora, Pennsylvania, USA","Sonicdescent"
3124,"2009-08-11",4.4,"Bottles from JW77 and Hopscotch and man what a beer.  So I guess I like sours now.  This one pours a beautiful rich and cloudy yellow.  Aroma is so tart, woody, funky, lemons and some nice sherry vinegar.  Flavor is sour but not so crazy that you cant taste the beautiful work that went into creating this wonderul elixir.  Sour lemon notes, tart funk and although sour as hell its just wonderful and smooth.  Kudos to Tomme.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

Had the pleasure of sampling this at the 7/9/2009 Pittsburgh RB tasting extravaganza (PGHRBEXT) at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. It will be a long time, if ever I see a spread of bottles like I did there. I am not good enough for the beers that were that we served! For example, how about this beer;  DD Gooze!  Big farmy aroma. Pale yellow pour. Very good tart initial flavors. Not bitter and very enjoyable from the start. Lovely stuff. Very nifty biting carbonation really adds to the palate. Interestingly tart funky stuff. One of the better beers at this gathering. A very pleasant beer tasting experience. Finish? What finish, its gone before I knew it, blast. Overall? Simply lovely!","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
3124,"2009-08-11",4.5,"750ml. Thanks to Hopscotch for sharing this amazing beer. This is probably one of my favorite beers Ive ever had. its not gonna pull as big of scores as Consecration due to its character but its still amazing. Nose is a little sulphur, huge acidic lemon sourness, some light citrus. The flavor kicks you in the teeth with sour lemon dominating at first then huge sour acidic lemon that is nice and burning on the way down. This is the closest I think Ive had to a real gueze. I think Tomme deserves some real applause for this as its really a milestone. Amazing beer, amazing accomplisment.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"

A - Darker yellow, sorta mirky. Nice white fizzy head, good lacing for a AWA. 

S - Sour/tart, but not overly so. Just perfect. Orange peels, sweet citrus, funky.

T - Wow, this one is damn good! Sweet/sour citrus melded together perfectly. This one is sour, but not so much. Rather, its a perfect blend of both together combining into a wonderful AWA.

M - Fizzy, champagne-like carbonation. Light-medium in body. Really refreshing and such a clean/dry finish...awesome.

D - Such an easy wild ale to drink...I probably could have drink the entire bottle myself if not for the tasting I brought this bottle to. Cant wait to crack another open and review again.

3124,"2009-08-07",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2009 Thanks Mike for this amazing sample.  Pours a slightly hazy light yellow gold with good color saturation and a lot of shine to it--a very pretty beer. The aroma is complex with multi-layered fruity sourness from the multiple barrel fermentations that is reminiscient of both fresh berry fruits and horseblanket/animal aromas.  It is both fresh, clean, dirty, and hugely complex all at once.  The flavor delivers more of the same: a densely-compacted flavor profile that really rewards close analysis of everything that’s going on in this massively complex brew.  There are many types of sourness, fruitiness, animal-ness, and spiciness going on here combined with  exquisite barrel-aged characteristics.  The mouth feel is both is assertive and nimble, delivering the huge, multi-faceted flavor profile into full contact with the tongue.  This is one of the finest sour offerings available alongside Isabelle.  Definitely seek this out for an extraordinary, noteworthy experience.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

It is pretty intense actually, lemon, funk, quite acidic at times. (8+) Average palate is quite carbonated. Overall it is too sour for me to  drink a lot of but wow!

Had this sitting around a campfire surrounded by great people, which is often enough to make any beer good, but this one was rather fantastic all on its own, living up to its hype in my eyes.  Pours a hazy light brown amber with a thin white head.  Funky, sour lemons, hay, leather, and bright acid.  Remarkably complex.  Large acid and vinegar, not as hefty as some Cantillons, but certainly up there.  Delicious, but does finish with a little bit of nail polish remover.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

3124,"2009-07-31",4.4,"Bomber.  Pours a lovely, bubbly, orange-brown-yellow, with about two fingers of fast-dissolving head, and a kickin sour aroma that I can feel from 10 - 12 inches away.  As I get my nose closer, its a sour bouquet of oranges, hyacinth, and overall sweetness.  I have to admit, Im psyched to have this beer as rating #100.  Wow, my first taste is powerful.  Its starts out a little sour, and then goes straight green apple tart on me... lovely.  Not really picking up the oak finish, but it doesnt matter, this is delightful.  I agree with the prior rating about the pixie stix sweetness and explosion through the middle and end of the palate.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

Tons of upside.  The oak and oak tannin are strong as they were on release for Issy.  Sourness is just right with a light bit of funk.  Should develope into a really nice brew over the next 9-12 months and last 10+ years.

3124,"2009-07-25",4.6,"Fantastic.  Light sour beers are by far my favorite beer today.  Lots of flavor and yet still easy to drink. DDG has a fairly high acidity, consisting of mostly lactic acid, but with a wonderful level of acetic acid, much like cider vinegar.  No floor cleaner ethyl acetate that I dont like, which Im now thinking is only present in high ABV sours.  A bit of lemon. Some throat burn like grapefruit juice.  Another LA hit along the lines of CC, Isabelle, and YB.  I could easily be fooled into thinking I was drinking one of these.  Excellent formula for success.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

3124,"2009-07-20",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2009 Tap at Stone Sour 09.  Looks really great with its bright gold and thick-ass white head.  Could use some haze.  Smells so supremely legit I thought this would be the beer of the fest: really sharp, peppery, varied and yes, funky.  Reminded me of 3 Fonteinen Vintage which is a slam dunk compliment.  The taste is a typical US mishmash of unripe strawberry and a vague tartness.  Not even particularly bacterial.  Wont be worth the $45 they will probably charge for bottles.  Update a week later: I cannot stop thinking about this beer.  There was a light peppery taste in the sour flavor that makes me want to drink it a lot.  They probably put crack in it and thats why the bottles will cost so much...  Second update: boy was I right about the bottle cost, huh?  Anyway, Shyam poured me a sample from his Blue Palms bottle and it was much better than on tap.  Much more yeasty and bacterial - really sharp, cheddary and layered.  Citrus and a great funk for this side of the pond really came through.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"
