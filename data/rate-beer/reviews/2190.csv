Looks: Clear light amberless than one quarter finger head and residual soapy white foam which fades in 15 seconds; Fair good sticky lacing with active carbonation.

Pretty solid brew where the hops and malts play well together.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

No alcohol and its clean, but perhaps not a very good strength of aroma, all told.Sweetness emerges immediately (caramel, cookie dough) and then becomes balanced by moderate hop bitterness and eventually succumbs to the carbonation and wateriness. Along the way there are some interesting sourdough and fruit notes. Fairly balanced and with enough maltiness for the style but the texture is just really sad here. Its overcarbonated and what is there is rather fizzy and loose. As well, theres very little richness of malt (suppleness) that one would expect from a top notch Oktoberfest.

Shame on you Sebastian for proving that American brewers are that clueless.  I am willing to bet that he convinced the folks at Sierra Nevada that modern Oktoberfestbier is no longer amber, but dark golden.  What he failed to mention is that the reason for this is that the Munich brewers are too cheap to use Vienna and Munich malt in their beers and have compromised the style despite the fact that the price of a liter continues to skyrocket (the average price at the 2015 festival is $11.38).

2190,"2015-09-17",4.5,"Ill start my 800th rating by saying that Ive had Sierra Nevadas Oktoberfest on tap at their Oktoberfest in Chico and this new version for 2015 is completely different. The old Oktoberfest was a fairly dark lager that, while a good beer, was really not in the style of Oktoberfest/Marzen. This new version is so to style that they should be serving this in Germany in a few days when Oktoberfest kicks off! Crystal clear medium golden yellow with a perfect persistent white head. The aromas are dead on German lager with a toasted malt nose. The taste follows suit with a perfect bready malt flavor and creamy texture with a touch of light vanilla sugar sweetness. This is balanced by a solid earthy bitterness that tastes like proper Noble hops rather than American hops (not sure if thats true or not) and is a bit more assertive than you would generally find in a German version, but it works beautifully here. The bitterness and delicious lager flavor stay behind after every sip and makes you crave more each time. Sierra Nevada obviously went out of their way to partner with a German Brewery (Brauhaus Riegele) to create this Oktoberfest and the result is nothing short of spectacular. This is now one of my (if not the) favorite Oktoberfest lagers Ive ever had and I cant wait to have more of it on tap in a few weeks at Sierra Nevadas Oktoberfest in Chico!!  Im kind of bummed that its going to change again next year, but if the next version is anything like this one, I cant wait to try it. Happy Oktoberfest (in 2 days) everyone!

2190,"2015-09-09",4.1,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours an orange-amber color with a big billowy white head. The head fades rather fast to leave a little bit of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the brew is rather strong of a bready and sweet smell with the sweet being a mix of caramel and some harvest fruits of apple and pear. Along with these smells comes some notes of a more grainy smell and a little bit of a nutty smell.
 Taste  The taste begins with a rather sweet and malty taste with a good sum of caramel and molasses as well as some stronger bready tastes. These tastes create a base flavor for the brew and constitute the mass of the flavor profile. While lighter upfront, some fruit flavors of pear and apple develop toward the middle only to fade again as the taste moves onto the end. The fruit that fades however is replaced by some other sweet flavors of more caramel and brown sugar. All the while, some more grainy and grassy flavors develop on the tongue, leaving one with a rather sweet and malty, but overall balanced and very drinkable Oktoberfest taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is rather average overall with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. For the style the feel and carbonation were great as they made for a nice subtle media for the sweeter tastes, all while maintaining the malty tastes as well as the lighter background grain and hop nicely.
 Overall- A rather nice Octoberfest with a great blend of sweet and malt all while maintaining a very easy drinking and enjoyable feel. I hope Sierra and Brauhaus Riegele keep this collaboration up. They make a good brew!","","Darkmagus82"

The taste follows the smell with a sticky sweetness lingering along a moderately crisp to sweet nutty aftertaste. The finish is quick and semi-sweet.

After reading an article about this being the best ofest in the world, I was mildly offended when I discovered this tastes virtually nothing like the Munich exports. No chewy toffee malts, really hoppy. But as I dont rate to style, I was not gonna really ding it, but I guess I couldnt help but be annoyed as I gave it a 3.6 and hit submit. Then I had a 3rd, and a 4th, and those spicy hops kept kicking up against the lightly sweet malts, and I thought, damn this is growing on me. I deleted the rating.

Some white grape aromatics and sunny bright pils character. Pour ultra clear deep, dark golden with a soapy off-white head. In the mouth, a bit coating/chalky with pleasant grainy bread crusts, that berry/grape is also here, no doubt, with the wine fumes in the aftertaste; nutty and toasty character more for the aftertaste after the bright but mild citrus subsides, but the toast is king in its domain. Malty medium body, medium sweetness just slightly overpowers bitterness. Really like the different direction taken here, fundamentally enlivening without simply dumping on the newest aroma hop.

This is a pale amber beer which is perfectly clear and topped w/ a foamy but small white head. Its aroma is kinda mild, lightly toasty and grainy but this really has a nice malt character overall. Its dry--you see, Sierra Nevada understands that malty styles do not have to be sweet--and there is a solid heft of toasted malt and some pleasant grain husk notes. This is medium to full bodied w/ brisk carbonation and a lingering earthy bitterness in the finish. Honestly, I am pretty much at the point where I have to say Sierra Nevadas lagers are more to my liking than their ales, which seems almost blasphemous, but, hey, I call it like I see it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

2190,"2015-08-17",4.2,"A steady pour into my Sierra Nevada IPA glass produces a two finger thick, pale amber tinged, tan colored head. the beer is a pale amber / copper color that shows a brilliantly clear, deep gold tinged metallic copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma has a spiciness to it, a sweet maltiness, as well as a solid, whole grain complexity to it. Soft notes of currants, spicy hop notes, lots of caramelized malt complexity, red grain cracker aromas, sun-baked grain husks, spicy red grain notes, and as the beer warms up a touch, soft, floral, citrus notes.

Spicy, bitter, but balanced with a solid malt character, this beer is actually very balanced in my first sip with a bit more hop character than I was expecting from the aroma. Peppery, spicy hop notes and a carbonic bit balance out the caramelized, and whole grain malt flavors that add just a touch of malt sweetness. There is a touch of fruit character here, perhaps more from the hop character than the malt, though the latter supports it; the fruit notes lean towards currants perhaps, with maybe just a suggestion of floral citrus character. The beer has a lively effervescence to it, and this matches nicely the light, but still chewy, medium-light body that this beer achieves; the body of this beer is just about perfect for this style of beer.

I was actually expecting this to be pretty good, but this has still pleasantly surprised me more than I expected. Quite well executed, and it really has a nice, fresh, malt / hop balance to it that makes this quite drinkable.

2190,"2015-08-09",3.6,"8/9/15. 12oz bottle, sixer, from Publix. Crystal clear light orange pour with a big khaki head, great lacing. Cant complain, looks nice. I even busted out a dimpled mug for this one. Nice aroma takes me back to when I used to like these sorts of toasty lagers more... nice biscuity malt aspect, grassy, toasted nuts, pale and pils malts. Yum. The flavor disappoints, sadly. There is a nice light toasted aspect but the beer is quite sweet, loads of caramel, and an almost acidic bite that straddles between green apple and lemon juice for me. Finishes with a nice dry toasty aspect that makes me sad about the sweet middle. I wish this was a tad more chuggable and less sweet. Otherwise not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
2190,"2015-08-09",3.9,"On draft at the ALS event. Wow. Is it weird I thought this was one of the best beers I had at the festival? It pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is nice and toasted with light hints of mandarin orange and noble, earthy hops. The flavor is the same. Very bready with a strong toasted finish. The noble, earthy hops come through sronger with only light hints of orange and florals. The fresh, toasted malt quality is a stunner. So drinkable. Im so glad this one was put into sixers. Cant wait to pick up more.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

2190,"2015-08-07",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2015 12 oz bottle- Pours clear golden with a nice large white head that slowly reduces. Aroma is grassy hops, sweet light caramel malt, toasted grains, all subtle. The taste is at first caramel malt, then a generic beery flavor comes in, which i wish wasnt there actually, then the hops present themselves, spicy and grassy,. Body is thinner than expected and carbonation is on the high side. Not bad, easy drinking and enjoyable.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"

Flavor is caramel malt with some grain with some bready notes. Finishes with crisp floral hops and herbal yeast. I like that Sierra Nevada collaborated with a German brewery to create this beer.

2190,"2015-08-06",3.5,"12oz bottle, from Dutchs. Bottled 7/09/15. Clear orange color. Nice finger of white head. Leaves good ropes of lace initially, kind of just loose later though. Medium-plus body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter to moderate carbonation. Nice fullness to the feel. Very mildly dry finish. Great toasty, kind of bready, mild spicy, mild peppery aroma. Nice bit of oktoberfest lagery funk to it. Kind of biscuity. Moderate sweet taste, lighter but satisfying bit of bitterness. Very solid, satisfying oktoberfest.

2190,"2015-08-04",3.5,"Bottle at local Smiths. FINALLY SN releases a dedicated Oktoberfest apart from their Fall Pack, and an actual German style festbrau lager at that. I must admit, I was rather taken with their amber ale Oktoberfest rendition last year, but this takes me back to the Rheinland Pfalz, where the stronger amber lagers rule this time of year. As such, this is a little more bitter, a little lighter in color, and just about right at 6% ABV vs the typical ~5.5% amber ales that typically get passed of as an Oktoberfest over here. What can I say? Bring on the 1L mugs, the Oompah bands in lederhosen, and the strong armed frauleins in traditional garb (or not). Looks like this is a one time release, so Ill be laying in a few cases of this for the fall season","Los Alamos NM, New Mexico, USA","High_in_NM"
2190,"2015-08-03",3.4,"Bottle. Light copper orange hue, with a decrepit white head. Malty, breads, some slight caramel and malty sweetness as well in the aroma, some leaves and earth in there as well. Flavor is not sweet, but some caramel, light toffee, bread and leafy earthy jobs at the end. Lighter bodied. Just ok, but better than some other U.S. takes on the style.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","Nickls"
