878,"2010-08-20",3.4,"~2 oz pour on draft at the Sake Brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Pour is hazed cloudy whitish and clear.  Really interesting looking in the glass.  Aroma is a bit of citrus, some soft lavender floral and the normal fermeted rice notes.  Taste is a combination of the lavender floral and bright hot rice alcohol.  Though only mildly more alocoholic than the ginjo this really tasted a lot hotter.  Palate is medium bodied, a bit rougher which actually worked nicely with the taste profile.  Different, also nice.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

878,"2009-01-12",4.0,"Sampler @ the Sake brewhouse.  I have never had a Nigori before and was very surprised to see how cloudy it was, like rice milk, well that gets extra points for appearance.  Aroma is like a sweet pea pod mixed with dry grass, and a very strong berry aroma.  I was shocked how strong the aroma was for a sake, still struggling to understand what the standard is supposed to be.  Taste has a very apparent alcohol bite with sweet berries and a left over heat at the end from the alcohol. I can actually feel the murky unfiltered specs on my tongue, gives it a bit more substance, so I liked that.  I recommend this over the other house taps for a different kind of Sake experience.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
878,"2008-11-28",3.7,"At the brewpub.  Thick and opaque, like milk.  There are little pieces of ground rice, and lots of them.  The best palate I have ever had on a sake.  Dry aroma, but medium sweet flavor, some fruit, and mild alcohol.  Very drinkable.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
878,"2008-10-28",3.7,"On draught at the sake brewhouse in uptown, Minneapolis, MN. Pours a cloudy chalky off-white sake with minimal tears and off-white disk top. Aroma is very faint but has a light pear and koji scent that can be challenging to pick up. Taste has a more  powdered rice and mild pear flavor that quickly disappears. Finish has a mild white pepper, a touch of honeydew with a quickly disappearing semi-dry aftertaste. Lighter in flavor and texture than most other nigori sakes Iâ€™ve tried but a nice refreshing unfiltered sake over all.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
878,"2008-10-28",3.8,"Solid cloudy appearance.  Increasing aroma of koji mold.  Floral aroma with hints of honeydew.  Very very smooth appearance.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
878,"2008-10-28",3.6,"Cloudy white appearance, kind of like watered down milk.  Very light aroma of mold.  Light rice taste.  Big floral, orchid-like taste.  Solid honeydew.  Incredibly smooth and silky feel.  Impressed!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
