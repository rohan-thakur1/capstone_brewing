Nose is chocolate, vanilla fudge, dark fruit rinds, light peppery spice, jammy berry fruit.
Taste comprises black forest gateaux, chocolate log, red berry jam, tofee fudge, mollases, light roast.
Full bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close with a light boost.

1457,"2017-02-14",2.2,"Everyone seems to love this one. Lets disagree, aroma is pure alcohol...nothing worth smelling here. Pours dark black...love stouts so it has potential, unfortunately initial taste is alcohol, kinda like drinking a shot of whiskey. Aftertaste however does work itself out into chocolate, caramel and other dark flavors. Quite nice actually. In the end $8.9 a pint and $34 dollars a 4 pack not worth it. Many others considerably better at half the price....",", Wisconsin, USA","longshot"

The barrel kicks in harder down through the glass. Taste is big vanilla, dark chocolate, caramel, some ash, some licorice. The vanilla/caramel trumps all down the glass. Somewhat alcoholly, the blend is solid, if a touch rough. solidly carbonated. Full bodied. Finishes well blended between bitter and sweet. Time to warm, or a bottle to age (or it turns out -- a CAN to age, as the Barley John rep says they will be releasing in cans in the fall), and this could be excellent.

1457,"2013-11-13",4.3,"Thanks to foofaa for sharing this growler with all of us.
The Dark Knight Returns, reviewed from notes.


A - Pours pitch black with a nice one finger tall tan head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty streaks of lace down the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of warm bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee and caramel sweetness, oak and some dark roasted malt. Very well balanced all things considered, a truly lovely nose.


T - Starts off with the warm bourbon quickly giving way to a nice mix of sweetness; mainly chocolate, vanilla, molasses, toffee and caramel; oak and dark roasted malt. Finish is sweet with some dark roast and a mild booze burn, lingering long after the finish. Much like the nose it is really well balanced.


M - Big body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, roasty feel with a nice shot of warming bourbon at the end of each sip.


O - I really loved this one. As some of the other reviews have said it kind of smells and tastes like Bourbon County. It has everything I love in a bourbon barrel stout and yet it remains quite drinkable. I would love to have this one again in the future.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

The beer appears nearly black, with a small, mocha colored head that hangs out for a bit, leaving random traces of lacing on the glass. The aroma is fantastic, with delectable bourbon, oak, roast, and chocolate. The beer is so smooth and well balanced. Hints of brown sugar with a healthy malt, bourbon, and roast presence. Delicious! The beer is medium to full bodied and creamy. Silky smooth on the palate, with alcohol hidden extremely well. Carbonation is light, but present. Overall, an outstanding beer. Highly recommended.

In long: The strong nose is an explosion of bourbon barrels and alcohol fumes,  not much else going on in the aroma, a wet-dream for the bourbon barrel aged beer lover, which I am not  Taste is a slap in the mouth.  Lots of residual sugars, lots of booze, lots of bourbon, burnt cacao powder, burnt oat, some coconut, notes of black pepper, light vinous notes.  As thick as a beer can be but surprisingly relatively well carbonated for a 13% BA monster.  Alcohol is not well hidden at all, ratebeer says it is 13% but I suspect this 2011 batch was much higher, three of us had to work hard to go through this growler.  A brutal beer that is also way too expensive.

Theres a little roast to offset it, but the barrel aging brings it way over the top into cloying sweetness.

Viscous body with lots of boozy heat and bourbon flavor.  Way too hot with lots of burning alcohol that overpowers the other flavors and tons of warmth/burning in the finish.

But everything is really just riding under that huge layer of bourbon right at the front. The first sip hit me with a big shot of alcohol, but after the initial palate shock, I got a lot of dark and bittersweet chocolate. Subsequent sips offer a lot of the barrel character right on the front along with the alcohol, which gradually fades to the dry bittersweetness.

1457,"2010-01-05",4.0,"The Dark Knight (Returns) version.

Short version of the review:
Bourbon disguised as beer.

Slightly longer version:
Pitch black, basically now head. The liquid doesnt look very viscous, rather thin actually.

Massive bourbon notes take the lead in the smell, notes of vanilla, coffee and cocoa. Lots of well integrated alcohol. The malts struggle to get through, but the bourbon rules supreme in this one.

Bourbon and hot alcohol basically attacks the mouth in wave after wave. Really powerful and rich taste. Big notes of vanilla and oak. After a few sips, more nuances of somewhat sweet dark fruits, cocoa and dark chocolate manages to come through. The malty backbone is present but restrained. The finish has a decent bitterness to it with lots of warming alcohol and, what do you know, more bourbon notes.

Medium body, not as big as one would perhaps believe. Smooth and elegant texture. Mild carbonation.

D: What a beer! Nine times out of ten I would prefer the bourbon notes to be more restrained than they are in this one, but for some reason I think this one manages to pull such a bold character of. Although the beer is completely dominated by bourbon, its still rather complex (wouldnt dare to call it balanced though). Its also important to note that you can really tell that its an imperial porter rather than an imperial stout; it doesnt have the big body, nor the massive roasted malt character of an imperial stout. And I think this plays an important part in the success of the beer, since a bigger body, stickier texture and bigger roasted flavors would probably be to much with all the bourbon. With the porter backbone, it actually manages to come out as almost easy to drink.

This pushed more sweetness than usual. This was a very good brew. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

The flavour is medium to sweet and light to medium bitter with complex tones of oak/bourbon/fresh wood/vanilla beans, molasses, creamy dark chocolate, toffee, rum raisins, arrack and light notes of coffee beans. Bit vinous with notes of red wine, plums, blue grapes and black berries. A good alcohol warmth Strange hints of sugar peas. The mouthfeel is fat, oily, quite silky, only light sticky and light carbonated. Aftertaste of bourbon wood and dark malty notes like dark bread and chocolate. Near full bodied.

1457,"2009-01-14",4.3,"First of I want to say I usually hate barrel aged beers, especially overly barrel aged beers and I often dislike, in particular, Bourbon BA beers.  However, the difference here is this is not a beer aged in bourbon but bourbon mixed with a little bit of beer and it becomes an awesome alcoholic beverage.  Tap at the brewpub and served in a small wine glass, apparently 5.5oz.  Its a silky black static beer with a small ring of dark brown head.  Presentation is pretty cool I would say. Aroma is all delicious booziness with fruity alcohol.  No pretense of beer given here, its hard liquor done very well.  There is no oak or anything, just straight up bourbon.  Taste starts with a thick chocolate sweetness and then bourbon and more of that fruity alcohol.  It is actually so good that it makes my mouth watery after sipping it.  Thats right sipping, cause there is no other way to drink this.  Its just as strong tasting as a distilled spirit and this is the first time I have drank a beer that I believed has been underestimated in its alcohol content.  About 3ozs in and I felt giddy.  Maybe this is a beer and bourbon cocktail for all I know.  The mouthfeel works great with it.  It is not one of this thick, underattenuated brews, but the sugars have been eaten up.  Its goes down easy but leaves an essence of alcohol heft.  Wow, this is a doozy and man was I presently surprised. I could barely finish my small glass, it was that strong.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Pours a flat, oily black with a thin tan head that left only a faint ring around the edge of a glass.  Looks more like flat cola or a black malbec than a pint of ale.  Aroma is a little boozy at first, but once is breaths there’s vanilla, oak, toasted wood, toasted bread, chocolate, coffee, Kahlua, bourbon, soy sauce, liquid smoke, dark cane sugar and a little bit of rum.  Flavor is again, very boozy at first, but then it becomes very very chocolaty, with rum, whiskey, brown sugar, molasses, some soy, vanilla, and coffee with cream.  The  finish and the mouth feel make this beer.  Flat and oily in the mouth with plenty of heat from the alcohol, but the crazy thing is, after the shock of the booze wears off you wind up with a creamy, sweet, delicious after taste in your mouth.  What starts a very good beer melds into a great beer by the end.  A total shock and far far better than I imagined it would be.

The flavor is initially very, very bourbony, but as the beer warms this becomes more manageable and the flavors balance out a bit. The bourbon still takes center stage (which admittedly is not really my thing), beyond the bourbon there are some very nice chocolate, caramel and burnt sugar notes, with some burnt malt bitterness. The palate is a bit thin for such a heavy beer, but is very smooth - pretty easy drinking for 13%.

Aroma is bourbon heavy but some roasted malts, vanilla, and chocolate coming through as well. Taste is pretty rough around the edges if drank too cold. Once warmed the beer improves drastically. Chocolate, molasses, charcoal, chewing tobacco, and leather, all mix together with oak to blend nicely. A general sticky and syrupy sweetness prevails on this ale and is certainly meant to be sipped. This being said I think that the oak and bourbon are very nicely done and it is one of the best examples of bourbon barrel aged beer Ive ever had my only complaint is that this beer is a tad too thin on the mouthfeel.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

Flavor was also massively complex, with chocolate, coffee, roast, bourbon, molasses, some random grains that are reminiscent of oats, vanilla, and cherry.  Cherry showed much more as it warmed.  Bourbon definite in both the flavor profile and enhanced by a clear alcohol component.  Reminded me if someone took a DFH WWS and dropped a shot of bourbon into it.  All and all, an outstanding beer that is worthy of its current top 50 hype.  Only complaint would be the presence of some slightly rough alcohol notes and some could say the bourbon is too obvious.

Initially I thought this beer was going to be a straight-up bourbon bomb, since all I smelled was bourbon at first.  This was deceptive though, because as it warmed it turned oh so much better, as the bourbon yielded to smells of port and chocolate which was really unexpected.  The taste was a nice iinitial hit of bourbon/vanilla, with the middle being chocolate, and the finish rounding out with a nice roastiness that reminds you its still a porter, which is nice because the bourbon blended quite well and didnt rob this beer of complexity like other barrel aged beers.  There was some slight alcohol that singed the nostrils and danced on the tongue, but it was minimal.  The beer was thick, but not real thick, and the finish lasted forever.

Could stand to be a little thicker, but overall very well done.

Charcoal, more molasses and some weird skunk I cant recall. This blend smacks you in the face with hot alcohol, totally raw. Almost a task to drink a full glass....and damn, we had this whole growler of fresh Doom sitting in front of us. Thick oily mouth feel.

Flavor is again mostly bourbon spices with some maltyness and chocolate flavors underlying a sea of spice and plenty of alcohol warmth. Body is a little dissappointing, just barely medium bodied, i would expect a lot thicker and/or creamier for a 13% beer.

1457,"2007-11-16",4.2,"500mL hand bottle from July, sampled tonight.  Pretty much black with a small bubbly head that doesnt quite cover the liquid.  A 1/16"" tan head does form when roused, and dissipates to a ring after a short while.  Lots of bourbon, chocolate, roast, and vanilla in the aroma.  There is also some dry wood, dark fruits (think raisins and figs), and some alchol.  Flavor adds a nice sweet element to combat the roasted malts and grain.  Vanilla and chocolate (much stronger in the flavor) blend very nicely in the middle to the ""pre-finish.""  Spicy char dry wood finish.  Bitterness is at a 3 at the back sides of my tongue.  Medium body with light carbonation due to the hand bottling.   Since this was the first use of the Pappy van Winkle (or whatever the hell it was), its still pretty boozy and bourbony--but if its done right its great.  I think it was done right.

Having never had the Old 8 porter makes it difficult to differentiate the bourbon infuences from the porter skeleton. The bourbon definitely adds another demension to this beer and it is the life of this beer, but it doesnt detract from the whole beer itself. So muuch going on here, Dark fruits, strong bourbon, oak, smoke, vanilla highlight the nose.

1457,"2007-09-02",4.6,"Growler from brewfiend.  Drank with a few friends.  Growler was a month old at the time of opening, but was still carbonated.  A beer of this magnitude needs no carbonation, but it still adds to the palate to have some.  Pours thick and pitch black with little head.  Aroma of lots of sweet caramel, subdued roasted grains, some oak, and a low level of bourbon.  My friends said the bourbon was pronounced, but I thought it perfectly on edge of attention.  Thick body.  Taste is like the aroma, sweet malty, perfect amount of oxidation.  After many hours of thinking, I could only come up with one suggested improvement:  Some maltodextrin late in the boil for better head retention and mouthfeel.  This improvement may not be needed as my growler was a month old.  So you ask:  Was it worth it to pay $70 for this growler?  Well this is equivalent to paying for 3 $23/22oz bombers.  I think it is worth it once/twice a year.  Heres an interesting note:  I poured Cobra into the same glass, and thought this Cobra smells great!  But I think it was the carbonation of the Cobra lifting the aromas from the Dark Knight.

this one was on my list so at 2:30 PM I was in line at Barley Johns.  Having never had this release I was glad to get a sample.  Since it is pricy at the brewpub it is almost worth the cost of admission just to get to try it here.  I was a little disappointed but part of that I attribute to the heat.  This is a great beer that just doesnt stand up well in 90+ degree temperatures.  Hopefully it will be on tap on a visit to the Minneapolis area so I can try it in its natural habitat.
Aroma / Appearance - The murky black body was almost as dark as an imperial stout; in fact it may be moreso than some poor examples of the style.  A tan head about a half finger in height sat on top as it floated in my kolsch glass.  Mint, caramel and vanilla make it apparent this has been bourbon aged.  The mint almost had me thinking mint julep for a second.  Chocolately undertones are mellow offsetting the sweet and creamy profile well.
Flavor / Palate - Rich caramel, hazel and oak immediately coat the corners of the throat.  The bourbon is strong but balances the coffee flavor well.  It does create something perhaps a little too boozy but thats to be expected from something that sat in 23-year old barrels.  The end result is some burning of the throat but nothing too intense.  A creamy finish imparts expresso notes along with a hint of oatiness.  On the whole this was very enjoyable though not quite Top 50 in my opinion.  Its possible that it was just the batch - I will certainly have to try this one again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Big initial bourbon slap, pretty smooth actually, and those intensely burnt grains and sugars ease on down the palate pretty easily.   The texture is thick, viscous, and did I mention ""syrupy""?

1457,"2007-06-24",4.5,"Approximately 5 or 6 oz. pour of the Dark Knight (not the Dark Knight Returns), on tap at the brewpub. I tried this during the pub crawl at the RateBeer Summer Gathering 2007 in the Twin Cities, MN on Friday, June 22, 2007. This porter is aged in Pappy Van Winkle 23 years old barrels. For the non-whiskey fans out there, that is widely considered to be one of the best bourbons in existence.

<P>Not surprisingly, strong bourbon and, to a lesser extent, oak scents dominate the powerful aroma, which also features raisin, chocolate, and berry. The smell is very yeasty and alcohol-heavy. The yeast in particular stands out in the aroma until the drinker reaches the very bottom of the glass. Pours a surprisingly sparkling dark brown with an amber hue and a small amount of light brown head. Produces a moderate amount of lacing.

<P>The flavor is very bourbony and malty. The alcohol is defintely noticeable; hops, not so much. Chocolate, port, vanilla, carmel, and nut flavors. A touch of roasted coffee is present in the finish, although there is not as much coffee flavor as I expected (but Im not a big coffee fan anyway, so thats a good thing for me). Reminds me of a bourbon pecan pie in that the bourbon really makes its presence felt even given the strong underlying flavors.

<P>Straight bourbon aftertaste. There is a distinct alcohol bite in the palate, almost to the point of burning the throat. Thus, the palate sensations are reminiscent of those experienced from a bourbon (albeit in a toned-down form, of course), and that appeals to the whiskey fan that I am. Remarkably smooth but nonetheless lively in the palate.

<P>Ive heard some complaints that the new Dark Knight is too bourbony. I understand the objection, because the bourbon flavors are quite strong even by bourbon barrel beer standards, but I certainly do not share it. This is one of the better porters in the world heavily infused with the flavors of one of better whiskeys in the world, and, as a lover of both great beer and great whiskey, its a near-perfect blend to me.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

A total monster, thats for sure. Intense vanilla bourbon aroma. Roasty, boozy, wet, and just massive. Flavor has that and more, with a brilliant chocolate sweetness, fruitiness, and delicate oak notes adding a huge complexity. Though its clear this beer is huge, it in now way seems to hit 13%, at least in direct alcohol taste. Even 12oz isnt enough for this beer. This shit is amazing!","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Its quite viscous on the palate. An absolute explosion of flavor: coffee, malt, toffee, oak, bourbon... wow. This is some truly complex stuff. Unlike any porter Ive ever encountered. More along the lines of an imperial stout. The bourbon flavor was very pronounced... almost too much. Original rating 6/14/2007

Whoa! This one has changed quite a bit, Sticky malt with LOADS of bourbon alcohol on the nose. Lacking the coffee and vanilla of a few months ago.

1457,"2007-06-09",4.5,"Poured from a growler of the 2007 Dark Knight.  Dark inky reddish black color with a short brownish tan head.  The aroma is complex and multi-layered.  I first sense a pronounced bourbon barrel aroma with a jolt of alcohol very much like a fine small batch Kentucky bourbon.  There are also aromas of vanilla, dark chocolate caramel, molasses, and  sweet malt.  The flavor explodes in the mouth with notes of alcoholic bourbon, sweet caramel malt, chocolate, and a slightly bitter coffee finish that balances nicely with the sweetness.  It is rather light on the palate with pronounced alcohol, which is not a problem for me as it adds to the bourbon feel.  I do however wish the alcohol were a bit more concealed on the finish.  Overall this is a truly fine porter - probably the best I have had to date.  Definetly worth the effort to acquire, especially for those into barrel aged beers...

Rather sweetish initially – with sweet vanilla bean, kahlua, oak, and some bourbon flavors. The bourbon is less than in the original Dark Knight, but is still quite noticeable. And delicious. However I think the vanilla-kahlua flavors dominate this time around. Prominent oak and roasted grain in the finish. Full bodied but still kinda smooth.

Pours to a slightly murky, black color, with a slight tan head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is incredible, with complex layers of aroma. Sweet malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, pepper, toffee, and light roast flood the nose. The plate is like silk on the tongue. Complex flavors of what was in the nose grab hold, and just do not let go. Lots of good chocolate, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, and coffee flavors.

The nose draws you in like none other... vanilla extract, mocha, freshly-roasted coffee, delectable sweet bourbon... if it has a flaw, its that this is too enticing.  As I was trying to discern the complexities of the aroma, I found myself drinking it.  The flavor department was more than solid, but did not quite match the nose... deeply-roasted coffee and mocha at the core with vanilla beans and Jim Beam sweetness resonating outward... this was lighter on the palate than expected, considering the massiveness of the aroma and flavor.

A little bit of bourbon, some vanilla, and lots of great sweet charred oak.  The aroma is really complex and smells simply delicious.

The alcohol is really not that present at all, ecspecially for being 13%.

1457,"2006-10-27",4.5,"Courtesy of Footbalm. Its nice when you get a whiff of a highly rated beer and know instantly it isnt all hype. Rich milk and dark chocolate, blueberry, coffee, cream,fudge brownies, molasses, caramel and vanilla. The chocolate/fudge and coffee elements are strongest, but the blueberry fruity notes make a decent showing. There is a slightly dusty note in the tail end of the aroma. Quite varied and concentrated though. The body is deep black and holds a slowly diminishing thumb thick mocha head that compresses to nickel thickness. Slightly hot boozy notes in the first sip followed by burnt/bitter roast and coffee notes. Unsweetened bakers chocolate, low sweetness dark fruits, very light bourbon notes. The mouthfeel is actually very porter-y despite the massive un-porter 13% abv. which youd think might make it more an Imperial stout in thickness. The finish is vanilla, sweet cream, brown sugar and some more dark fruit notes this time lucious grape, raisin and prune. Doesnt dissapoint. Great range.

1457,"2006-08-07",4.3,"On tap at the brewpub, August 2006.
Mostly opaque with a dense tan sawdust layer on top and a thick, dark, creamy tan wrung around the edges.  Aroma is intriguing.  Scotch whiskey gives out bourbon infused, caramel laden milk chocolate truffle characteristics.  A touch of permanent Sharpie markers signal the alcohol strength while bittersweet chocolate lays the layers on chocolate complexity.  Sweet port and dessert sherry flavor connotations accrue on center stage.  Truffles marinate in a pool of port.  Belgian chocolate is a backdoor bandit with coursing caramels amidst steeple chimneys.  Fathomless complexity, taking bourbon barrel aging to not just a different level, but a completely different genre.  Medium-to-fuller bodied with a sweetly joyous tract performing pirouettes on the palate.  Cordials melt away, seeping down the tongue slowly when it touches the roof of the mouth.  Artesian candies preoccupy the otherwise enthralled faculties residing above the shoulders, as we look to the next incantation.
The Dark Knights Returns.
Opaque and inky brown in color with livened translucent edges of mahogany at the brink.  Bourbon pairs with black currant and plums sitting in port sauce to ring the aromatic dark fruit bell.  That goddamn Sharpie element is still prevalent, but this time it systematically sings with sycamore thats been singed twice over.  Infused black tobacco with dashings of espresso dippings rounds it out.  Authoritatively syrupy with a toasted hazelnut and French roast centricity.  Warming chocolate senses steal glimpses of Grand Marnier fornicating with Godiva and Frangelico liquors.  Dry, roasted barrel edge gives light to the blackened honey graham pursuit.  Syrupy substance is entirely flavorful at all turns, posturing the stronger remnants of bourbon early-on in a format of fused truffles.  A sipper, bright with promise, finishing with campfires and singed marshmallows to bout in the final salute, eventually dwindling into matchsticks, port and crisp cigar wrappers.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1457,"2006-08-02",3.5,"Bottle (hand bottled) from Santa.  Pours black as ink with no head (the bottle had a fair amout of air in it, so the low carbonation may not be a feature when it comes out of the tap).  My first impression of the aroma was that it took me back to my model-building days.  It smelled almost exactly like the little bottles of paint I used to paint the models.  While that might sound bad, it triggered some good nostalgia, and then other components of the aroma came through that were more appropriate: a hint of bourbon (not over the top like so many BA beers today) over roasty goodness.  In the mouth it was very sweet (a little too much for me) with a touch of bourbon (again, in just the right amount), and hints of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, etc.  It was pretty flat (again, probably not true if you get it direct from the tap).

1457,"2006-07-21",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2007 I heard about this small little brewpub on the north side of the cities, close to my old apartment I lived in 9-10 years ago.  All of these local ratebeer guys were raving about this place that I didnt even know existed.  Actually, it didnt exist when I lived there but was built after I moved to the southern suburbs.  Then I was told, ""You have to try this Dark Knight"" if it is ever available.  Well, I just found out it was.  And I had an opportunity to visit as I was up around the area.  Below is my review of this wonderful elixir. <P>

The Dark Knight -                                                
I waited in anticipation as robertsreality poured my this dark black beauty.  One whiff and immediately I was seduced.  The perfumes were of dark chocolate, raisin, cherry, bourbon, with lacing all over the glass.  Very sweet taste.  I can see why some may be put off by the sweetness, but I found it very good as a dessert type beer.  <P>

The Dark Knight Returns - 
Poured with very little head, which would distinguish this from the original Dark Knight.  Similar in scent to the DK, but slightly mellower.  I like this even more than the original, as the bourbon sweetness is more softened and mellowed out.  Wow!

Aromas were very sweet chocolate, dark cherry, hints of liquor and anise.  More dark dried fruit.  Flavors were very similar, Dark fruit, chocolate, sweet cream.   The sweetness takes hold at first with the liquorish bourbon coming in for a finish holding hands with the warming alcohol.  So sweet.  This is pretty darn good.

1457,"2006-07-10",4.2,"On tap at the brewpub.  Hmm.. why are these classified as the same beer?  They are quite different in many aspects, other than the similar malt profile.  Its obvious from tasting them side by side that they have been created using the same base brew, but the barrel characteristics completely alter the perception of each, making them rather unique from each other.  Anyway, I will list my observations below and try to come up with an average rating for the purpose of this entry.The Dark Knight ReturnsTasted first.  Pours the dark black color of night with a thin, bubbly, sea foamy layer of wispy, toasted marshmellow head.  Mellowed out aroma of bourbon and toasted malt, accompanied by a mild vanilla sweetness.  Some gentle dark chocolate and lightly roasted coffee create a pleasant backdrop to the smooth noes of oak and smoke that curl to my nostrils from the bourbon highlights.  Medium bodied mouthfeel that brings a complicated array of flavors to the palate.  The first wave of flavor is quite sweet and reminds me of chocolate liquore sweetened with caramelized raw sugar.  The bourbon notes are quite a bit sweeter than I initially expected, but are pleasant nonetheless.  This being the first bourbon barrel aged porter I have tasted, Im pleasantly surprised by the effect its had on the beer.  The porters malt character is deliciously balanced, but takes a back seat to the dominating bourbon characters.  The alcohol notes are well restrained however, bringing the focal point to the flavor profile of the barrel.  Sweet and slightly syrupy with a final smack of raisin nut bread.The Dark Knight  Tasted second.  Dark chocolate colored pour with a tall, creamy layer of roasted brown head.  Much thicker and silkier appearance than the DKR with a richer helping of frothy chocolate whipping cream head.  The bourbon notes seem to be a bit more subdued in the aroma, as the milky chocolate characters of the porter caress my nostrils with a velvety softness, accompanied by some sweet notes of honey and toasted oats.  The coffee and chocolate notes seem to smell much milkier than in the DKR, and this is also echoed in the beers appearance.  The mouthfeel of this brew is better than the first, as the palate is much more full and creamy, creating a delicious froth coating on my tongue.  Some sweet, fruitier notes of black cherries, raisins, and ripened plums also reveal themselves boldly from behind the bourbony sweet malty background they remained hidden behind in the first tasting.  The bourbon character is much stronger in the first half of the finish, where the alcohol comes through a bit strong.  This gives way to a slightly spicy finish of black pepper and nutmeg.    Quite delicious overall, and brings a nicer mouthfeel and flavor profile to the palate relative to the DNK, although the alcohol is a bit hot.  Absolutely delicious overall as a pair, and quite fun to have the privilege to taste side-by-side.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
1457,"2006-07-08",4.8,"pours a black with a small tan head intense aroma of vanilla, whiskey, alcohol and malt. taste is much of the same with a pleasant in your face boldness that i truly love. upon first sip i loved this beer.","plymouth, Minnesota, USA","kms399"
1457,"2006-07-08",4.2,"12 oz handbottle, via footbalm.  Very dark brown pour, almost black, with a small dark brown film of head that ran to the edges to form a thin ring.  Aroma is fruity with lots of bananas leading off, then a nice blend of chocolate fudge, light bourbon, and oak tannins.  As it warmed the bourbon came out a little more, but still well reigned in, along with some alcohol fumes when you inhale very deeply.  Flavor is really quite different from most bourbon beers because of it being a Porter.  The usual heavily roasted Imperial Stout flavor Ive come to expect just wasnt there.  Just lots of chocolate and fruitiness under the bourbon.  The actual bourbon flavor certainly plays a prominant role, but didnt really dominate until almost at room temperature.  The finish has some roast, with a noticable amount of warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel is very full bodied and oily in texture with a nice soft fine carbonation.  Finish is quite sticky and cloying.  Overall, this started out great but by the end of the glass it  neared room temperature and the bourbon really took over.  A quick pop back in the fridge for 10 minutes brought that in check though.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

1457,"2006-06-05",4.4,"many thanks to Footbalm for bottling this up, poured a jet black color with a thin, but solid coffee colored head, which was a bit surprising for something so dark and barrel aged, imo.the aroma was magnificent, chocolate, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, and burnt malts were abounding.  the flavor was just as well rounded and smooth, the bourbon was a background element, not a dominating one, which to me, is a very large bonus.  the aftertaste was sweet, the chocolate and vanilla tones holding on from a very thick bodied brew.  possibly the best porter ever.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"

The nose had lots of complexity, but licorice stood out. There was also wood, and vanilla, roasted chocolate, and I believe heaven as well. The taste, well all the taste from the nose rushed over my tongue. The bourbon was ever present, but kind of like cloudy on a bright sunny day. There bit complementary. The alcohol was also in the after taste and plenty of warming. Oh, to try a bigger sample, and to try this again. Loved this. It was way beyond the hype.","West Paterson, New Jersey, USA","Lou18"
1457,"2006-03-10",3.9,"(11.2 oz bottle filled from growler: Obtained 17-Jun-05 in trade with footbalm, thanks Eric!) Been in my fridge since I got this 9 months ago.  I opened this bottle thinking it was ""just a porter"".  But pouring the beer into my tulip glass and taking one short sniff and I know just how mistaken I am.  The aromas of bourbon, very sweet dark malts, sweet molasses, some earth and gentle roast are intoxicating.  But with as sweet as the nose was, it still didnt prepare me for how sweet the flavor is.  Dont get me wrong, I love sweet, dark beers, but this is enormously sweet and almost too much for me.  Bourbon is also very prominent, which is fine with me, but the alcohol is a bit hot for my tastes and needs to be scaled back a notch or two.   Real nice chocolate flavor in the finish after the bourbon and alcohol fade off the palate.  Full bodied and lightly carbonated, but the hotness on the palate is a bit unpleasant.  Carbonation is mild overall, but being a hand-bottled from a growler, carbonation is more than sufficient; the heavy wax dipping Im sure had a positive effect on carbonation retention.  Medium-dark brown, opaque only through the center of the glass.  Almost no head, only a few pour bubbles that soon dissipate, but its a nine-month old, hand bottled, high-octane beer from a growler, so what do you expect?  Overall, very bourbony, too alcoholic, shockingly sweet, so could probably use a bit of restraint.  I wonder, too, if the aging has diminished the hotness at all?  And with this being the second use of the barrel, I cant imagine how bourbony and alcoholic this beer must have seemed on the first batch.  Nevertheless, despite the excesses, its still damn tasty and enjoyable.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
1457,"2006-01-12",4.0,"How have I notrated this beer yet!? This is the original dark night I had. Quite dark that poured with some lumpyness of chocolate. Well developed head that looks oh-so-nice. Mostly roast and chocolate on the nose. Fantastic taste dominated with caramel, and bourbon flavours. The bourbon was a bit overbearing, but Im not really a huge bourbon fan either. Some coffee flavours that have a hint of tobacco. Probably the best porter Ive had, and most certianly complex with lots of big flavours. Ill dock the flavour  a point for the bourbon that Id prefer not to have so evident. Maybe the Returns version will change my mind.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

One sniff above the snifter and you can tell this is going to be a great beer.  Aroma of bourbon, molasses, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a bit of licorice.  One sip and you know that the aroma didnt disappoint.  Flavor is very complex and quite amazing.  Bourbon, molasses, and a bit of vanilla upfront but soon gives way to a rich chocolate flavor that emerges along with some coffee bitters but finishes quite sweet with some notes of oak, much chocolate, a bit of raisins and that bourbon flavor all blended together so deliciously.  The palate is as smooth as anything Ive ever tried.   Like aged Kentucky bourbon.  It just feels great in the mouth.  Amazingly thick, and creamy yet oh so balanced and smooth.  The warming notes of the alcohol on the back of the throat after each sip are oh so welcome on a snowy Ohio day.

The Dark Knight Returns pours to a medium thickness tan head atop a dark black body.  The aroma is sweet and caramelly.  Brown sugar and candi sugar.  Bourbon barrels.  The flavor is insanely sweet.  Lots of candi and powdered sugar.  Bourbon and sweet milk chocolate.  The palate is rich and coating.

1457,"2005-08-14",3.7,"Sampled at the Great Taste of the Midwest, Madison, 8/13/2005. My second attempt for this one, the first being the original Dark Knight at the brewery. I sampled this in one hand with Great Danes Bourbon Porter in my other. I must say, I enjoyed the Great Danes considerably more. Even with the toned down bourbon notes, I find it hard to get passed them. My nose is flooded with bourbon (vanilla, caramel, toffee, and charred oak) which is just fine, but I get the same thing on the palate. Theres just not enough diversity of flavor here to back this up on the palate. All in all, its great stuff, but Ill take Great Danes Bourbon Porter (and a few others) over this one.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Flavor is a buttery roasted chocolate with some wood and bourbon coming out in the aftertaste.  As I drink this sample more and more caramel and coffee come out in the finish.

1457,"2005-06-20",2.4,"Its a given that Im not a huge fan of bourbon-barreled beers, but I run into occasional exceptions where I find that a beer is tweaked in some intriguing way by the bourbon character.  Tragically, this was not one of those times.  I sampled both the original Dark Knight and the newer Dark Knight Returns side-by-side, and was distinctly not impressed by either.  The Dark knight was, not surprisingly, quite dark, smelling strongly of dark sweet fruits and bourbon.  Very flavorful, though not in a particularly pleasant manner.  Strong bourbon character (which was largely expected), but the real surprising part here was how sweet this one was, its a very powerful figgy/molasses sweetness mixed with the bourbon.  Basically tasted like somebody made a huge batch of cloying fig juice and dropped a shot of bourbon into it.  As for the Dark Knight Returns, enjoyed this one a bit more.  Still very sweet, not as cloying, the bourbons a bit lighter allowing at least some roastiness and a bit of coffee bitterness through.  Still, too strong, and my teeth hurt by the time I was done.  Did not enjoy either of these, but it didnt really have much to do with the bourbon character of either.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
1457,"2005-06-14",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2005 Tap @ brewpub.  I took down a couple samples of this beer and did a side-by-side with the original Dark Knight (""DK"").  Solid black color served in what appears to be scotch glass.  Amazing complexity and richness in flavor and aroma.  Sweet mollassas, bourbon, dark fruits, and a suble hint of alcohol.  Sherry and chocolate dominate the flavors that linger long after the finish.  Full-bodied and syrupy as it coats the mouth.  In the side-by-side comparison, I found DK to be smoother, sweeter and more fruity.

1457,"2005-04-04",4.1,"Very close to black, surprising initial head lasts a minute or close, light brown and persisting despite the high ABV and relative amount of time since this has been hand-bottled by footbalm. Strong overbearing sheer powerful nose. Bourbon character shines through the mellow and well stated roastiness and beefy chocolatey flavors. It creates an aftereight mint chocolate equilibrium through which vanilla and vinous peaks shine through. Very well balanced, the bourbon is just enough. I wish we had tried Alfred in the same sitting, but this would have been a bit much really. I sure did appreciate the dark chocolate and vanilla powers of this one, especially how the roastiness kicks in roaring with burnt fruit aspects (grapes). Lasting alcohol finish is not unpleasant at all. Not very thick body as seems to be the case with more barrel aged beers, but this is definitely most comfortable. If I consider the palate its only weakness, it nonetheless has an appealing softness and smooth carbonation to boot. Truly superb, one of my favorite barrel-aging jobs. Cheers to the man.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1457,"2005-04-04",3.7,"Oak, vanilla, marzipan, sherry and chocolate in the vinous, fruity and alcohol-laden aroma.  Opaque black body with thin cover of brown head that recedes to ring with surprising lace considering the high octane.  Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, mint, oak and fruity flavours with a charcoal-like roastiness in the finish and strong notes of alcohol.  Definite warming with medium-full body that feels very dry and somewhat thinned despite the sweetness - a trait I often notice with barrel-aged beers.  Hand-bottled from a growler.  Snifter, allowed to warm from fridge temp.  Enjoyed with Claude, MartinT and Rastacouere.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"

Pours an opaque pitch black color, almost no carbonation.  Aroma is lots of bourbon, a little coffe and sugar. Mostly booze.  Flavor is suprisingly smooth and a little sweet. Lots of milk chocolate and sweeter malt comes out. Smooth and complex, lots of brown sugar and molasses in here, vanilla, bourbon, and a touch of almond.

Its not bad by any means, but the heat is a bit out of whack and Im not a big fan of the way bourbon flavours blast their way through just about every beer they touch.

1457,"2005-03-07",4.8,"First thanks, again, to master trader footbalm for hand bottling this and shipping it to me. On to the review. It says something about a person, I am not sure what exactly, when they spend 5 times as much on the nightly beer as they did on their dinner. It is with no shame that I admit to eating Mac and Cheese from a box for dinner (or as they say in Canada, Kraft DInner) and now I am pondering this beer that costs about $1 per ounce. Pitch black body, oily pour, a very nice small tan head that diminshes into a small ring of soapy little bubbles that cling to the glass and fight to never expire. The aroma is loaded with the typical bourbon barrel characteristcs: oak, vanilla, alcohol (bourbon of course), caramel, cherry, some citrus rounds teh whole beautiful bouquet out. The flavor, ahh the flavor. The other two Barley Johns that I tried were quite good, but this one is heads above those others. There are three distinct and each wonderful stages. First is the sense of alcohol, coffee, and choclate coverd cherries, then an tingling bitterness and alcohol warmth develop, finally everything comes together to create a luscious chcoclate, cherry, oak, bourbon, vanilla, and all that. Sure it is sweet, but it is not cloying or too syrupy. The palate is fantastic, full, assertive, warming, light teeth coating. This is a case of a much hyped beer deserving the hype. Brilliant and many kudos to the brewer and again to footbalm for helping so many devoted ber geeks enjoy this magnificent brew.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

1457,"2005-02-15",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2005 (Dark Knight) First of all, HUGE props go out to Footbalm for getting me this beer. Tasted side by side with its non-aged brother, Alfreds Porter. 12oz hand bottled bottle.  54.6°. NB worthy glass. Poured a dark, dark black color with no head to speak of except for some bubbles and a slight khaki-colored haze. Upon swirling, I find it coats the glass. You can smell the bourbon barrel on the nose. Along with the dark malt, you pick up the wood with its vanilla and woodsy flavors with some sourish notes early on. Flavor is overly influenced by the barrel. The flavor is very woodsy, with an abundance of oakish tannins. Sourish dark malt comes through at first; then the hops impart their flavor, giving a spicy feel. The finish is more of the same barrel flavors, the wood and to a lesser extent, vanilla, with some hops coming through and fading into roasty barrel flavors. The barrel flavors, in this beer, overwhelm its great flavor. Nice mouthfeel. The Alfreds Porters was much more complex and was a clear favorite.  I finished the last few sips @ 63°; it had a huge alcoholic burn.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Substantial aroma of bourbon (oak, vanilla), charred malts, licorice, and molasses.  The flavor hits hard with immediate bourbon fire, soon subsiding and leaving pockets of ethanol on the palate.  Hiding behind the barrel heat are chocolate notes that give way to hints of fermented dark fruits, molasses, and coffee, finishing with a touch of circus peanuts, leather, and salt.

In fact, In many cases I would rather just be kicked in the back of the head than drink a Porter anything. Sure, I have had good ones before but after having this, I dont think that I really enjoyed those past ones. This is the absolute-unquestioned champion of porters. In fact, just get rid of all other porters because they just dont have the right to exist up next to this thing. Now, onto the rating. Dark as night with a thin tan head. The nose was wow alcohol with a huge blow of malts and fruit (cherry syrup). The taste is alcohol through and through with oak and bourbon floating around in there.

Because of its thinness on the palate and over the top alcohol vapor in the nose this could have passed as a liquor.  There was so much alcoholic vanilla that if someone had blindfolded me and had me taste it, I might have thought it was meant for cooking, not quaffing. I tried to take small sips and let it sit in my mouth.  I tried a gulp to see if I could get into it that way. Nope. Just boozy.

The intitial flavor is a bit overwhelmingly alchoholic, but the finishing flavor is to die for.

1457,"2004-11-22",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2006 2004 bottle from the growler, from footbalm, the most generous trader Ive ever traded with  Brought this baby to the DCMDVAWV gathering.  Aroma of scotch, deep, strong, rich and alcoholic.  On sheer strength, Id give it a 10, but because it masks a good amount of the baltic porter aroma, I think its only fair to give it a 9.  I love the aroma, but this is a beer, not a glass of liquor.  Flavor is simply phenomenal.  I can barely describe it.  You expect to be knocked down by all of the bourbon in the aroma, but it eases up a good deal in the flavor.  Vanilla and coffee beans, dark espresso, black licorice, molasses and thick, rich, strong toffee all weave about on the palate, tied together by perhaps the most luxuriously rich, silky palate Ive experienced.  Its decadent, its big, its damned good.  Because this is from the growler, it has a touch of thinning on the end, but thats to be expected and hard to really fault the brewer.  Very fresh flavor all the way through, with notes of charcoal, bitter tree sap and oak on the finish.  Like rum raisin pudding, with a big black pot of french vanilla roast coffee.  Spectacular and not overated, I can definitely say that.  Deep dark black appearance, small ultra dark tan/mocha head that rapidly fizzles away (its from the growler, and yes its got a lot of alcohol). Almost want to give it a five for appearance, Im less concerned that a beer has head retention than I am that is is unfiltered, which this obviously is.  Still, notwithstanding how great of an experience it was, the alcohol, roast and bourbon do mask a lot of the qualities Id like to see out of a baltic porter.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Full bodied, soft carbonation, thick vicious, slightly burnt bitter finish.  Awesome stuff.....","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"

1457,"2004-11-21",4.2,"BIG thanks to footbalm for this - Has one person ever done this much to champion a beer? And what a beer. Pours black, with no head. Big aroma assault  - Bourbon, vanilla up front, with hints of chocolate and port. Flavors include the bourbon, of course, but also vanilla, plum and prune, with some understated oak. I can pick up some hints of red wine, as well. There is a slight and ever-so slightly irritating alcohol burn. Every sip seems different, and it is obviously well put together. The wide variety of flavors blend seemlessly.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1457,"2004-11-21",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2005 The last time I tried this beer was during a massive gathering, during which I had had lots of beers already, and the sample size I had was minimal.  This time it was the Dark Knight Returns version, sampled at the brewpub.  Black body, tan head, nice lacing.  Aroma is moderately sweet, vanilla, bourbon, molasses, light caramel, chocolate.  Taste is much the same, though the chocolate is more pronounced and nearly the equal to the vanilla.  Moderately-full body, smooth/creamy.  An enjoyable beer, but I am not nearly so blown away as I was last time. (6/4/8/4/15)

I do not pay much attention to the Top 50 beers these days, so I had no idea this was a Top 50 beer when I tried it (Dark Knight).  Nevertheless, it stood out as soon as I tried it, definitely the top new beer I tried at the DC gathering yesterday.  Black body with minimal tan head.  Aroma is medium sweet, peat/scotch, roasty, oak, light caramel, vinous.  Taste is moderately sweet, oak, peat/scotch, chocolate, roasty, light alcohol (12%?!  I had no clue!)  Medium-full body.  Absolutely delicious!  I often ask what an Imperial Porter is supposed to be -- a souped-up porter is a stout, so why the fancy name?  Now that I have had this beer, I have an answer.

Thanks to Suttree for sharing this and to Footbalm for all the work hes done spreading this one around! You did a fine job bottling this from the growler.
Good pop when the cap was lifted on the bottle that formerly held a Bells Two Hearted Ale showed that this one hadnt lost it. Black pour with just a bit of foam that circled the top of the glass. If there was any translucency here, it was too dark at our sampling location to detect it, but this is a very dense brew and I doubt that a brightly lit room would have revealed any more than I could detect.
The first aroma was a heavy solvent - almost varnish like, but swirling the glass released the aromas beneath the vapors that rested on top to reveal heavy chocolate, vanilla, coffee and alcohol in a complex blend. Very heavy aroma that seemed to change constantly. The flavor worked well with the aroma, delivering lots of bitter chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, coffee and roast malt. Not a subtle brew, this one comes out punching.
The medium body worked well with the alcohol, strong but smooth. This is a fine Baltic Porter but a little over the top. Backing off a bit on the Bourbon barrel and/or alcohol content would make this more appealing to me, but if you like a heavy bourbon touch, then youll find this one to be a ""5"".","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

The mouth feel is exquisite.  The carbonation is very soft, might have lost a little in the hand bottling, but this just showcases the slick almost numb feel it has on your tongue.

I was getting ready to fly home for Thanksgiving weekend, just starting to pack my bags and UPS shows up... oh man, I was going to have a beer before heading to the airport anyway, and this is perfect timing.  Poured out of the bottle with a good later of carbonation, footbalm did a great job bottling this.  Strong nose of sweet cherried alcohol, a little bit of a nail-polish scent from the alcohol as well, but not in a bad way.  Some bourbon as well, and oh man does it show up in the flavor... this stuff is hotter than I expected, a little bit of a whiskey/bouron bite on the back of the throat, with a rich buttery and charred wood flavor everywhere.  Warming and tasty, its not that thick, especially for 12%, but it makes up for it in character.  Isnt overwhelming with the bourbon, something which Im very critical of in many other beers... wine and wood tannin flavors abound, reminding me of Poseidon without the stout and wine flavors clashing.

Better than 95% of the stuff at the FOBAB, even!  Alcoholoc, phenolic belgian chocolate with lush vanilln oak wafts.  First sip is amazing, rich velvet on my tongue, bitterness and sour vinous hints at the sides, rich bourbon and dark maltiness down the middle with a warmth that is intense but not harsh.  Each sip is like a complete dessert, chocolate cake, dripping with coconut and vanilla and dipped into a dish of cool well aged fine bourbon.  This is an amazing barrel aged beauty that would have knocked the freaking socks off of everyone at FOBAB!!!  Todd Ashman, did you play a part in this? Seems to have obvious signs of experience and knowledge, someones ""golden touch"", you might say.

Now thats a Bourbon brew baby.Its a very smooth brew at first but thats only for a brief second or two then the Bourbon jumps out at you.Then it quits and moves onto a nice wine like flavor with plenty of fruit maybe some raisin a little plum or prune possibly.The wood tones are a bit on the mild side at first but as the brew warms the become a little more noticeable.As  the fruit flavors pass it quickly jumps back into a bourbonesque finish with a nice alcohol burn as it goes down.First impression off the first tug of this brew made me a little squeemish at first but after a little warming its a fantastic brew with plenty of flavor and well worth the honor of being on top in its style.Thanks go to Footbalm and his fine job of bottling and letting me try this fine brew.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
1457,"2004-10-25",4.1,"Thanks to TAR for sharing a bottle and footbalm for initial supply: The beer is opaque and very oily, looks big and mean. The aroma is huge with noticeable phenols (doesnt try to hide the alcohol), plum and raisins, vanilla and mocha, oak and pipe tobacco, lactic acids, and aromatics all over the place. Heavy malts with burnt tones attack the palate but retreats to the more sublime characteristics of fruits and salt. Vanilla and oaky bourbon notes apply themselves during midsection followed by a closing act of spices and mild bitters.  Starts oily and lush before the alcohol bite whips into gear on the palate, warming indeed. This beer can take to aging very well and should mellow out the edges nicely. Well done with room for even more growth.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Edge of sweetness, very velvety, and then dropping out to a huge dryness.  Wonderful finish that sucks the moisture out of the mouth, dry and awesome.  A bit numbing.

This big brew pours opaque dark brown with little if any head, the initial aroma was of whiskey and cocoa. 

What I found important is that this beer really changes personalities as it opens up. We poured it straight fm the fridge, and the flavor was mainly alcohol and it wasnt too impressive. However, letting it warm up allowed its complexities to impress you. The bourbon is a nice background flavor, its there, but doesnt dominate. Notes of cocoa w/ hints of dark fruit dominate.

Melted fudge, bourbon tannins, and toasted wood on the surface. Notably vinous with prunes, vanilla taffy, and sharp, yet deceptive, alcohol undertones. Thick body, subdued carbonation. Slippery and soft. Sultry fudge richness immediately muffles the alcohol. Tight cask wood flavors revive the sharp alcohol toward the center. Chock-full of zippy bourbon tannins yield oodles of black licorice interlaced with decadent vanilla and caramel underpinnings. Retains its softness from the faint husky malt character and fluffy nougat. Charred wood continually firms the body and dries it out. Ends remarkably balanced with notes of caramel, coffee,  and lightly seared malts. Tannin-infused toasted wood lingers over an everlasting bed of fudge and mocha flavors.

Midnight black and thick with a tiny, fizzy, well-tanned head. The nose is to die for with notes of charred wood, vanilla, port, sour mash (of course), caramel, cherries, chocolate and espresso. Just the right amount of bourbon... not overdone.  The flavor pretty much matches the nose, but also has notes of blackstrap molasses and warm alcohol.

Flavor is dominated by whiskey notes, alcohol, and dark (sweet) cocoa powder.  This is very strong and there is an alcoholic sting with each sip.  The alcohol is drying here, but it would work a bit better if it were a tad bit sweeter, but Im nitpicking here.  Well-done.  I would have loved to linger over this a bit longer, but after patiently waiting through a late lunch and 4.5 samples, my one-year-old son was more interesting in getting to a napping location rather than listen to me prattle on about the pros and cons of barrel aging.

Aroma of lots of sweet caramel and roasted malt with some alcohol and big bourbon oak.  Body has lots of sweet sticky malty complexity and big warming okay bourbon balance.  Still a very nice beer, but this would be better if it could age some.

Dark Knight Returns (on tap at brewpub): Much more balanced and smooth than the original, while hiding its alcohol better.  Still, both are great beers.

Growler (original Dark Knight): Pours a very dense, thick motor oil black with a thin dark tan head.  Very complex nose of dark chocolate, coffee, plums, caramel malt and plenty of tart bourbon oak to balance it out.  Starts milk chocolatey sweet with a touch of hoppy bitterness before the bourbon flavors take over and lead to a complex and warming finish.  Not much carbonation at all, as has been noted previously.  This is a real smooth, complex, and balanced brew with a great texture to it.

My initial reaction to this was like the reaction I had when I was one of the fairly early people to ""discover"" the Free State Owd Mac--like, ""oh my, Im ahead of the curve again!""  Later I wasnt so sure.  First, there is no question that this beer comes to your table with all the marks of quality.  Poured into small snifters, it is 100% opaque and oozing with richness.  The aroma is not quite as complex as other top-notch beers--I thought the vanilla notes were overpowering, though there were heavy notes of fruit (raisins, grape) and the bourbon, though without much pure-alcohol notes effervescing into my brain.  There were a lot more flavors--more grape, coffee, fruit, roasted, vinousness/port, and more, but it was not stinging on the palate.  There was more carbonation than I generally like here.

Total blackness, ebonys epitome, with a tiny ring of burnt brown espresso-toned foam foam.

Taste: again, incredible. Here, I wish there was a larger serving, or that the growlers werent so damned expensive, for I needed more time with this rich and ever-unfolding flavors. Thick mouthfeel, bottomless, vast, stretching on and on...same flavors from aroma return on the tongue, dark, twisted, utterly delcious, like chocolate and licorice and a jolt of Jack Daniels on the side, with bitter bites of espresso tones to match the abysmal texture (in this context, Im using the good definition), and wickedly sweet nature of the flavor.

1457,"2003-08-14",4.8,"Aged in a bourbon barrel and double fermented - Yum! 

Color is a solid black with some brownish highlights around the bottom. Small tannish head fades super fast and leaves very thin sheets of lace.

Smell is like a chocolate-chocolate chip cookie soaked in cough sryup. It has a good strong sense of alcohol, with a really nice woody/earthy deep dark chocolate, with complex notes of molasess, black licorice, dried smokey plums, raisin, vanilla, and fresh wild flowery notes. Its what I would imagine a chocolate factory in an open wet forest would smell like with one nostril while the other nostril is under a cup of Nyquil. I could smell this all day. Quite an intoxicating aroma, no pun intended.

Taste is complex, rich, and invigorating with a ton of deep dark chocolate, some molasses, fruity-like alcohol with a dark earthy quick bite of woodyness finding some hold about midway finishing with more complexing woody earth features of sweet malty tang and bitterness with notes of flowery spice like that of dulled mustard or ginger. Wow! The bourbon barrel worked its wonders on this brew. Fantastic! Very port-like in its character. Packs a big punch in flavor and alcohol, you can tell the alcohol is there but is mildly mellow and lends the feel to be smoother then you would think. Very rich, nearly full overall in mouthfeel with a welcoming smoothness that makes this dark knight a deadly easy drinkin' Porter. Super Yum!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
