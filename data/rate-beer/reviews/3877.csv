3877,"2017-05-18",4.2,"Tap at The Beerhouse in Urbandale. Slightly hazy deep gold body with a bright white head. The nose is amazingly rich with grapefruit and mangos. There is also some wood and yeast bread. The taste is sharp with some grapefruit and mangos character. I get an almost peach snd slight black pepper spice like character in the finish. The body is fairly light. A solid and interesting IPA. Its not mother puckering bitter but there is enough going on to keep it interesting. Very well done.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

3877,"2016-12-23",4.4,"Thanks Steve.
This was poured into a stemless wine glass.
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange almost brown color with a fingers worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Moderate messy lacing roams all around the glass.
The aroma flows nicely between some tropical sweet to grassy sweet hops with a sharp yet eloquent bitterness from some pine arranging nicely underneath. The malt base exacts itself nicely to complement the rest of the aroma.
The flavor starts sweet but eloquently allows the nice malt base to lay upon the hoppiness ever so nicely. Some caramel to toffee but seemingly just there and appropriate. Subtle sticky bittersweet hoppy aftertaste running into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a very nice sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation felt superb along my tongue. Bitterness is there, but still a nice smoothness does roll over my tongue.
Overall, wow, an AIPA worthy of its top numbers on ratebeer and to me. I would love to have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
3877,"2016-11-28",4.0,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate tropical fruits and pineapple mixed with lighter citrus and lemon peel.

3877,"2016-11-16",4.3,"Aroma - ripe herbal, resin, citrus, and floral hops. The citrus holds a mix of tropical fruit to include elements of lemon, pineapple, peach, and starfruit.
Appearance - the body is a hazy amber, with some fine sediment. The head is very effusive. Its challenging to pour, but well worth it. Head is off-white and 2+"", and almost never really settles. Stays foamy, and lays fat sud rings throughout.
Taste - is an amazing mix of hoppitude. There is citrus flavored hops, resin - reminds me of head band kind-bud, floral, and herbal hops. The citrus offers a mix of lemon, pineapple, and peach like notes. As the beer fades out the vegetal tones rise. The malt is deep below, but caramel in nature. Sound balance.
Palate - is on the lighter side of medium, the texture is almost smooth, the carbonation is average,","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
3877,"2016-11-15",3.4,"Bottle drunk 11/5/16.Medium-sized, white head tops a clear, brassy-golden-amber body with moderate retention.Very fruity in the nose with light papaya and nectarine-like juiciness. Strong malt backing adds lots of sweet vanilla, honey and borderline caramel. Light lime-like acidity on the end is joined by some pine and mild resin, but the strong malt showing more than balances everything here. No alcohol or flaw.Flavor-wise, its full of ripe pineapple, nectarine and light pine. Moderate carbonation, a bit loose at times causing the rather sweet malt to become slightly problematic and ""mushy""-seeming. Some good hop flavors, but just a bit forceful/inelegant overall.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Hazy/foggy deep golden hue topped by a largish frothy head that settles into a .5 cm lasting cream top...earthy, lightly smoky, herbal nose, faint resins but mostly that lovely allium perfume that seems to be a love-it or hate-it thing for beer lovers (LOVE IT!)....body is only lightly sweet, moderately hoppy/bitter throughout, some yeasty-bready characteristics, and a rough onion/garlic sharpness and acidity that is not quite like anything else Ive had - even other Mosaic-only IPAs; its like a bit of onion juice poured into the beer...body is average-tending-to-watery, carbonation moderate. Ive come to love the Mosaic hop, but in this case its a little less interesting and inviting than I find in, for example, Great Danes as-yet-unknown Mosaic Smash; but maybe it just needs more body to bring it out. Still a well-made, quality product like everything Ive had from TG thus far but not one of my favorites at this point. Very cool label design.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

The palate is light bodied and fully carbonated. Flavors of nigh impossibly juicy tangerine and sweet pink grapefruit with a very subtle malt backbone with a light and soft grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Another resurgence of pink grapefruit on the linger that seems to go on forever. The impossible juiciness of this beer is beyond comprehension and the fact there is no fruit makes this simply superb.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

3877,"2016-03-18",4.1,"Had it side-by-side with TGs King Sue. Bottled less than two weeks ago. Poured into Teku glass. Appearence is hazy, golden color with a thick, frothy head that retains very well after minutes of pouring.All mosaic gives it bright, citrusy character. Its aggressively resiny. Many tropical fruit notes: pineapple orange rind, lime as well as floral and earthy resin characters
Taste is again resiny with a bisucuity back notes of the malt. Its herby and got a very dry citrus + resin characters. Its light-bodied, making it fresh. Cant say its easy to drink because it feels very aggressive. Very easy on the tongue and the mouth though in terms of feel.","SOUTH KOREA","cyano22"

3877,"2016-03-01",4.7,"Heres a fun fact about Mt Vesuvius. When paleontologists explored the site, they discovered many of the corpses were missing their skulls from the jawbone up. When Vesuvius erupted, the resulting thermal waves that swept over Pompeii caught many helpless people in their wake. The intense heat caused the blood to boil. Since heat rises and the excess pressure had to escape from somewhere, these unlucky inhabitants met a rather gruesome end: their cooked brains literally exploded out of their skulls. Drinking Toppling Goliaths Pompeii is a less dangerous experience but no less - ugh, sorry - mind-blowing. The Mosiac hops are juicy, resinous, and piney. Flavors of tropical citrus, marijuana, and grass. Feel is creamy yet crisp. Another fantastic IPA from TG.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Citrus and piney resin in the aroma. Good mouth feel for the style, but not much effect from the carbonation. Good malt taste on the initial taste that transitions quickly to piney and bitter. The bitterness lingers into the aftertaste. Other than in the aroma, I dont get hardly any of the fruitiness or juiciness others talk about.

Then, drying out with more resin, and some pale biscuit malts coming in relief. Ends more bitter, resting on a delicious retronasal and lingering bitter tinge. This stuff is outstanding. I remember Pseudosue being better on tap, but the bottles from Florida cant live up to this IPA. Much more foamy head on the refill - an easy 5 in appearance. More dank grassy funk in the rich head.   On the fence between 4.5 and 4.6 for this one.  My only  complaint would be that its just the slightest bit too .....   you know what?  Forget it.  This is awesome.  For single-hop and 5.5% ABV, this is a masterpiece.  Update:  Head is so pillowy - never seen a head like this.  Overall not as mind blowing as my previous experience.

Offers up a fantastic hops diversity, producing citrus peel, riper blood orange, fresh cut grass, as well as papaya which builds a well working bridge, inviting sweeter malts. Tart citrus, together with grass stand out the most, which leads to a refreshing, intriguing hop forward nose. 

Has a medium fitting carbonation, which is spot on, as the taste unload lots of different, tied together flavors.

Tastes of mineralic infused dough white bread, immediately coated up by stronger growing lemon zest and dank grass. The malts then get a tad sweeter, leading to orange and ripe papaya, leaving enough space on the palate for the beers dankness. Throughout the taste is focused on the diverse hops profile, while they range from grassy to fruity, ending with a pleasant, illustrating bitterness.

The pour is a nice orange-ish gold with a huge white head and some excellent lace as it falls down to a ring with an island of froth. The aroma is surprisingly Belgian for what I was expecting. The bready malts and yeast dominate the front of the nose. There is a little light fruit and a touch of dank pine on the far back. The flavor is surprisingly spicy. The Belgian style really dominates. It's got a lot of clove and bready malt and just not at all what I was expecting. I am not a fan of this one. The mouth feel is decent. There is a good thickness and the carbonation might be a little overdone, but it hangs around. The aftertaste is lingeringly hoppy, which is probably the best part

3877,"2015-03-26",3.6,"22 oz bottle courtesy of Johns Grocery (Iowa City, IA). A fresh load of hops on my door step. Pours a well hazed dulled golden orange hue, a more dulled glow and darker hazy middle make this a bit lifeless at first look with something brooding beneath as we go forward. Fuller whitish head atop stays as a fuller, thicker ringer atop. Nice lacing, solid retention in the glass. Aromas are fruity and lively, melon and tropical fruit play liberally. Juicy Fruit gum, mangos and pineapple meld into touches of fleshy papaya, gentle citrus and cool sweeter melon, bubblegum. Gentle bready and grainy malts, jabs beneath that potent but not overwhelming complex fruit bouquet atop. Subtle florals, earth. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body, some punchy bubblegum and tropical fruit come out to fight. Citrus, florals, jabs of melon. The fruit potency doesnt quiet reflect that more juicy nose. Instead, a decent bitterness and lots of green melon start to roll as we move on, a bit more mellow, refreshing and fruity. This one tapers out on the bitterness. Firmer melon, touches of tropical fruit and decent to mellow bitterness catch the palate. Some bubblegum life, jabs of pithy grapefruit and lemon, rind oils provide some tepid bitterness as we round the corner. This thing starts fierce, fruity and full of life and really falls flat on its face, never really gives that potent Toppling Goliath bitterness weve become accustomed to previously. Its a shame that this tapers and finishes as it does, a dishonest bitterness wraps this thing up, floral and earthy, a faint jab of aspirin as citrus rind and bitterness character is quickly fleeting. A beer that strarts quite promising, juicy and alluring that just doesnt offer a creative or potent bitter finish like it should. A bit thin overall but some really nice character in the nose and up front. Overall, its only disappointing because of the hop they used and its lack of coherence from such a ""Rock Star"" style hop. Nice beer.. but it could have been so much more and I feel like its on the cusp of being there.. but its just missing that bitter bite to counter on the backend and finish. Clearly a different beer than previous years draft only offerings. Founders Promise does it better.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
