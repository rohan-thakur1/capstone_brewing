The beer is crystal clear and light yellow hued, leaving ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is floral, herbal, grassy. Nice flavor, with a strong hop presence. Very fresh. Lasting pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. Light in body, refreshing, and easy to drink. Complex and well balanced. A tasty brew. I would certainly have this again.

2814,"2010-01-30",3.4,"Enjoyed via draft in a pub glass.  The beer pours the expected straw-colored yellow/gold of a classic pilsner.  The aroma brings an interesting hop character:  slight notes of lemons, slight cattyness.  In addition to the hop aroma, this is just a very slight note of pilsner to the nose.  The palate shows hop flavors that are similar to those found in the nose: slight note of citrus/lemon, slight danky note.  Interestingly lacking is the strong sort of malt backbone that is present in a classic continental pils.  Instead, the drinker gets a strong note of alcohol in the finish, which is otherwise clean, slightly dry, and moderately bitter.  Overall, not a classic example of the style, but admirable in its creativity and craftsmenship.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Much more malt presence than Victorys standard pils, bready, floral, herbal, a hint of lemon. Dry finish with lasting herbal bitterness. Beautiful spiderwebs of lace cling all the way down the glass. One of the more complex pilsners I have had, very nice.","Mountville, Pennsylvania, USA","afireinside96"

2814,"2008-05-02",3.7,"Draft @ Frisco Grille its a moderately hazy golden yellow with a pure white head.  Somewhat of a starchy nose of sourdough, some light lemon, light pils malt and a clean, fresh pillow yeast. Flavor is mildly bitter, mildly dry, with a very clean and inviting crispness to the cracker-flavored malt base, and a mild, musty yeast character throughout.  Good stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2814,"2008-01-01",2.1,"Overall this is a very interesting beer. On tap at the Bocktown. Smells unique in that its mild aroma is a bit rubbery, but in a good way. This beer appears pretty much ubiquitous pale yellow american lager but there is some haze in there, very little haze. Carbonation is above average and welcomed. The flavor has some of that butyl rubber aroma carrying over into the taste. Is weird in that it is slightly tart and hoppy at the same time. Very complex. Cant figure out if its the rubber or the hops that is contributing to the medium bitterness. Finish has a bitter aftertaste that is difficult to identify.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
2814,"2007-12-30",3.8,"On tap at Bocktown (they had it listed as Victory Limited Lager). Wow..different than the few Z/K/Ls Ive had. Intense floral hop aroma. Smelled like a flower bed with a hop vine growing in the middle. Pour was a nice burnt orange with a 2 finger white head. Taste was very floral and hoppy with a suprise sweet aftertaste. After the sweetness goes away you are left with a bitter hop bite on your tonsils. There is a weird fruitiness as it warms. Very complex and different.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"

Aroma was a huge blast of green hops with floral and herbal notes.  Flavor was a somewhat shocking hop tea.  No discernable malt character whatsoever that I could pick up, much to my surprise.  Loads of green hops with floral, herbal, and slight grass character, long bitter finish.  But the lack of suffficient malts really hurt this badly for me.  RERATE:  Ultra clear this time around, still has a load of spicy, floral and herbal hops.  Great nose, flavor still hurts from lack of malt character.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Pour was a very clear yellow-cant remember the last time Ive had a beer this color in a glass. Smell is musty, funky hops. Flavor is similar, moderately bitter with resinous wet hops abounding.

2814,"2006-12-07",4.0,"First of all, if I was a rapper my name would be Braumeister Pils.  Secondly, this beer is awesome...for a lager.  I had this on tap and it is quite delicious.  Even got some specks of yeast in the glass.  Not sure that there was much aroma and what there was was typical of a well crafted pils. The flavor is subtle but totally complete.  It was moderately malty with a fair amount bitterness.  I noticed the malt more than the hops, actually.  I kept comparing the flavor to that of popcorn.  buttery and sweet on the palate and crisp, dry, and bitter on the finish.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"

Incredible fresh hop nose with lots of flowery notes, zesty earthiness and a bright noble spiciness that really needs to be smelled to be believed.  Saaz are usually underutilized, but here theyre bright and expressive.  Flavour is also all juicy/spicy noble hops.  Soft minerally character accents this nice massive spiciness.  Malts are barely there, just showing a kiss of breadiness and softness of palate that balances the crisp hops.  Awesome pils.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Very satisfying body full of crisp bready malts.  Plenty of noble hops perfectly balances the malty body.  Some morning honeyed-cereal and isual pils citrusy flavours.  Manages to be refreshing like a regular pilsner but way more tasty than average.  Excellent although not quite the stunning beer that many make it to be.

2814,"2006-11-06",4.0,"Any first impressions?
-A ring of foam stands atop the lightly-hazed pale blond.
-Citrus fruit and floral spiciness are derived from the hops, drawing a rustic landscape on the nostrils.
-Crisp citrus fruit freshen up the crunchy hay, evolving into a stunning sandy, wooden finish.
-Very well-malted and smooth, this creamy body amazes with its quenching abilities and its apparent fullness.

What if you dig deeper?
-I just want to lose myself into those flirtatious hops.
-The finish sagaciously lathers wooden, sandy hops, surrounded by gingery, citrusy hop oils.
-The haystack is chewy and sustaining throughout.
-Im not sure about the Kellerbier designation, but who cares, this is a fabulous unfiltered German pils. Absolutely lovely.

2814,"2005-12-03",4.1,"Wow.  A plain old beer cant get any better than this.  Remembering that a pilsner is just a close cousin to a lager, and that Budvar, the long ago home of Mr. Busch and thus the home of Budweiser is in the Czech Republic, this beer is amazing.  Appearance is a perfect 5.  An intense, almost luminescent golden beer with a huge, firm foamy head that laces the entire glass.  Hoppy nose.  Taste of sweet lightly roasted malt, classic hoppy bitterness, with an intensity and a spicy bite that must come from the freshness of the hops, and an herbal / grassy note in the background.  Mouthfeel is just average, as you would expect from a pils or a lager.  I added an extra point to the overall rating to reflect what a marvelous accomplishment it is to get this much into a simple beer.  I mean, anyone can make a complex dark Belgian, but this is the simple beer that would be served at barbeques in heaven.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"

Mt Hood works awesome in this new amped up version.  Pours mostly clear with some haze-light golden color and a creamy, frothy pure white head.  Aroma has that eastern european hop character- lots of spicy floral aromas with hints of dry earthiness and light grassiness.  Flavor is well rounded- initially with lots of hops upfront and then again in the finish, but then in the middle you get lots of pure fresh bready pils malt for balance.
