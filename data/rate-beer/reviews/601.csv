601,"2009-10-13",3.9,"Bottle Crystal clear sake. A couple swirls of the glass leave a beautiful ring near the top that slowly melts and morphs into twenty or so snake-like legs winding down into the drink. The cedar aging produces a wonderful cracked pepper nose. Medium to full-bodied with an oily/fatty mouthfeel. Sweet, but crisp, and a touch woody and peppery. Finishes off warming and lightly sweet and leaves a trace of spicy wood on my tongue.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

601,"2008-02-21",3.3,"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow tint.  The still body appears to be on the moderate side, as the thin layer of sheeting quickly retreats.  The aroma is quite peppery, with intense, fumy cedar dominating notes of koji, cream, and moist bread.  The flavor is again heavily wooded, spicy, and slightly medicinal.  Creamy, yeasty notes are underlying.  The medium body has a smooth texture, but it goes down quite hot, burning the throat on the way down.  I was not overly impressed with this, my first Tarusake experience.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
601,"2008-02-05",3.3,"6oz bottle from theCheeseman, I think? Someone from Florida.  Pours clear and light, I would almost call it clear and colorless like water, but there is a slight brown/yellow/tan hue, but just barely.  Oily and thick on the sides of the glass, with sheets instead of legs, and the viscosity of olive oil.  It looks great.  Nose is a combination of chemicals, rice noodles,  medicinal strawberries, white grapes and peach rind, and a bit of a burnt black pepper note as well. Flavor:  biting and sharp up front, then lightly sweet over the middle, settling into a very light, lively but pale and near-flavorless rice, grape and water state.  A little hot, and a little bit more of that chemical cleaner flavor that I could do without, but its an interesting drink, unlike anything Ive had before.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
601,"2007-10-05",3.8,"Thanks to the guys at Knightly for turning me on to this! Pours out nice and clear. You can definitely tell the cedar barrel influence on the aroma, giving it a woody peppery aroma. As this get colder, I started to get more fruit in the taste along with some alcohol and pepper. Leaves a hint of fruit in the aftertaste. Very clean smooth drink that is much better than any other sake I have had before.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"

601,"2006-01-22",3.2,"Sampled at the Milwaukee YEHa!05 courtesy of JPDIPSO: Pale clear transparent pour has thin legs.  Sweet complex floral ricce and cedar aroma has notes of coconut milk.  Starts with a thin, sweet milky viscosity and a touch of mild woody flavor with a warming, thin alcoholic finish.  An interesting sake, and I like the cedar character, but it could be thicker and hide its alcohol a little better.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
601,"2006-01-07",3.1,"Clear body, thick legs.  Alcohol, pear skin, floral sweetness (like eating a petal), and cedar.  Cedar + alcohol, powdered sugar and floral sweetness.  Some burny alcohol and grain in the finish.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"

Lighter bodied with a watery feel to it.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
601,"2005-12-19",3.3,"Clear water like appearance with viscous legs streaming down the glass.  Toasted almonds in the aroma, along with something reminiscent of buttercream face lotion.

601,"2005-03-16",3.9,"Clear with very faint yellow hues. Thick drooping legs. The aroma is interesting and a bit different then the other sakes I have tried. Melon (on the verge of being bad), cedar, pepper, and alcohol. The flavor is quite nice. The cedar really comes out late. Up front it is more melon and some sweetness. Before and immediately after the swallow the cedar kicks in. Soft and full mouthfeel. This is probably my favorite sake that I have tried.
