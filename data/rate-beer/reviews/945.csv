945,"2016-12-15",3.0,"A 330ml bottle, packaged on 24th May 2016, to be enjoyed within 12 months. Poured into a Mikkeller pint glass. It poured a clear copper amber colour with a one finger off white head that had pretty good retention and eventually settled to a nice thin layer while leaving nice lacing. Aromas were malty, caramel, tea leaves and maybe a touch of honey. But its all really quite light. Tastes like sweet biscuit malt with touches of caramel, wood, breadiness and lemon here and there. Crisp, light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall mouthfeel was great with nice crispness and tingly carbonation, but the aromas were too light and I really had to search for them.

Not saying Im enjoying it or looking for this in my beer, but at least its interesting. The distinct fruity Steam beer aroma is there as well, more so as it warms. Tastes of modest fruitiness and rather harsh, even unbalanced bitterness. Finishes rough... metallic, grapefruit peel bitter, yet somehow lagery... Mediumish body, rather active carbonation.

945,"2014-06-24",3.7,"This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a nice hazy amber to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. There was some light to somewhat foamy lacing trying to stick to the sides but it slides for the most part.
The smell was pretty good as it had a nice blend of sweet caramel malts to sweet citrusy fruits. 
The taste was mainly sweet through everything combined. There was a pretty good sweet aftertaste that lead to a dry finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation seems appropriately styled and was pretty good all around. 
Overall, well gee. Ive been having some Amber/Red ales lately and a fair amount of them just have seemed to be on par but this one because of the hoppiness that comes out but still doesnt come across as overbearing, Id take this one over a fair amount of other Red ales these days.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

945,"2009-07-05",3.2,"Another pretty standard beer from this brewery.  Amber pour.  Toasted bread, caramel, citrus, slight sweetness, and hops.  Well balanced amber, doesnt seem to much like the other CA commons that I have had.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
945,"2009-06-09",4.1,"Appearance: Pours a hazy, reddish-amber body with a frothy, sudsy, off-white head. Fair amount of lace on the way down.

Smell: Oven-toasted biscuits with a very distant kick of dark caramel and fruit boosted by hoppy scents of spice, citrus, coarsely chopped herbs, and wood.

Taste: Toasted, day-old biscuits with hints of dry caramel. Touch of Tomcot apricots. Hop profile displays full tastes of zesty, zippy spices and citrus. Also, maybe, just maybe, even a tad woody. Medium-high bitterness thats bold but not overbearing. The toasty qualities try to reemerge past the spice, citrus, and staunch bitterness, but its to no avail. Finishes dry and bitter with a lingering toasty biscuitiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Delightfully quaffable -- one of those beers that its hard to finish the review before I clear through the entire bottle. My first Baird beer and a rather good one! Heres hoping the other three I purchased are as pleasant.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
945,"2009-06-07",3.4,"Bottle from the Sams in Downers Grove, Illinois:  This poured a dull amber body with a respectable beige head.  Had some floaties in it.  It had an aroma of floral scents, toasted grain, and a squirt of pink grapefruit juice.  A nicely balanced flavor, leaning towards a floral bitterness near the end.  Nice drink.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"

945,"2009-05-22",3.6,"Extremely heady, over flow and long lasting. Dark amber body. Nose of pine roses and other floral hops, barley malt and a winey sweetness. Taste was quite hoppy, wood, pine, vinous and a bit sweet. Nice. Soft palate with a very long finish of grassy hops.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TheJollyOne"
945,"2009-05-10",4.3,"Generous, tight-bubbled head that remains rocky throughout the tasting.  Lots of chunky lace on the glass.  The color red-orange amber with a solid haze.

Sweet, hoppy and attractive.  Floral aroma of fresh hop cones.  Enough malt to make it very balanced.  Close to perfection.

Beautiful bitter.  The malt is present but in the background.  The hop, if I am hyper-critical, is leaning toward the harsh side.  Extraordinarily drinkable.  If I were to have a complaint, it would be that the liquor is on the thin side for such a flavorful beer.  Still, this is an exceptional beer well worth seeking out.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"

945,"2009-03-04",2.0,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2012 Overall , it just reminds me a little bit of a home brew gone a little a stray.  The nose has a very floral bouquet which is pretty common with some home brews.   The aftertaste has a nector flavor from a poorly brewed lager.  I had a lot of trouble getting past these issues which really held me back from saying anything very positive about the brew.  Will defeintely try another from this brewery, but likely wont purchase this again. 

11/2012: Tried it again and I feel th same way as I originally rated it.  Just soemthing about it that turns me off.","Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","ARMed"

945,"2008-07-27",3.8,"355 ml. Foggy, dark ruby-tinted copper color with a three-finger creamy head that lasts well. Big aroma of caramel, citrus hop, cocoa, grape and apple. Taste has not quite so much depth: more resin, wood, tea leaf and citrus than the aroma indicates, with a slight caramel-apple note. The blend of these flavors leaves a long finish of bitter resin and toasted nut. Medium body is watery, a tad too fizzy, and finishes almost astringently dry. Wow, the look and smell of this one is great but the taste and mouthfeel just dont hold up their end. A nice brew that is much better than Anchor Steam, but somewhat of a tease that disappoints after the exciting foreplay. Not really worth the asking price ($4.99).","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
