3909,"2017-06-11",4.1,"750 ml bottle. Pours a mostly clear orange color and topped by a small off white layer of foam that quickly settles and rejoins the body below. The aroma is really nice showing notes of juicy orange, smooth toasted vanilla, lactic sourness, and a creamy note that really reminds you of an orange dreamsicle. The flavor follows and is just as good with the juicy orange and creamy vanilla right up front and center to go with the lactic sourness that adds a nice tartness to help balance the orange and vanilla sweetness. This tastes just like an orange dreamsicle with a nice sourness throughout. Medium bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a juicy orange and vanilla finish with lingering sourness. Awesome beer and really tasty stuff.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

3909,"2016-10-27",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this at a share at Corbets house on October 10. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a nice golden orange with a smaller white head that falls down to a thin film relatively quickly. The aroma is pretty awesome. Its got a light dreamsicle thing happening. You can get the light orange citrus, the vanilla, and its pleasantly tart. There is a wheatiness to it, which is why this isnt a 10. The flavor is just as good. The orange and vanilla really pop. The dreamsicle is legit. Again, its lightly wheaty, but the fruit and vanilla are excellent. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly sweet orange and vanilla aftertaste. Fuck this is good!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
