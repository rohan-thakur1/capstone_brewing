1899,"2015-10-14",3.4,"Bottle, 330ml. Clear amber with an inch of off white head. Aroma of grapefruit and lemon blossoms, caramel, some bread. A fair bit of body for under 5%. Lowish carbonation. Sweet gives way to bitter pretty quickly in the taste. Theres some dried fruit in with the toffee and citrus flavours. Floral and herbal lemon dominates at the end. A trifle overhopped for mine, but pretty good.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

looks a dark amber colour, with the head retaining well.
Easy and light, with some strong fruity hoppy undertones, leaving a long taste.

1899,"2013-12-29",3.0,"Hand pump (keg) at the Hop Garden in Wellington. Hazed dull brown body with a film of large bubbles on top. Caramel malt, candied orange, herb / grass / spice, bread crust, toast and nut aroma and flavor. Medium-low sweetness, similarly matched bitterness with a lingering EKG-like herbal lemon oil / spice flavor late. Carbonation is low, yeah its ""cask"" so it should be low but this is basically flat rather than naturally carbonated.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1899,"2013-11-17",3.5,"The head is ok, the body brown-red. It smells hoparomatic, bit malty, bit dry. The taste is hoparomatic, bitter, bit malty, bit fruity.","Otorohanga, NEW ZEALAND","kiwianer"
1899,"2013-07-27",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2014 An enjoyable English ale that makes a good addition to Townshends range of sessionable brews. Definitely one for the handpull...","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
1899,"2013-06-10",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2013 Strangely, this English Pale Ale, named after rich archaeological site in Suffolk, considered the first proven hothouse for the incubation of the Insular Style, is described on the label as an American Amber Ale (?!?). I popped the crown open and saw this brown, milky, sticky liquid at the lip. That per se would not bother me, but the colour that this beer pours is the only low point. It puts me really off, and I see nothing of Anglo Saxon, but more of Aztec  as what you get with Montezumas Revenge. Right, but now to the good features: Very sweet Grapes on the nose. I love those fruity aromas, with a touch of passion fruit. Such a New Zealand touch for the Pale Ale. Flavour is sweet, with biscuit, malts, grapefruits, lots of grapefruits, and a touch of Grand Marnier. Medium bodied, with a stingy, dry, bitter finish that expands like needles in the palate before quickly vanishing. Amber ale, really? I think the label description is an allegory to represent the confusion over the true style of Sutton Hoo, believed for many years to have been viking.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
1899,"2013-05-23",3.4,"smells like an ESB to me, and tastes a bit like one too. lovely punchbowl of fruits on the nose, perhaps led by peaches. smells better than it tastes but still good, with a bit of yeastiness creeping in. only managed to get a taster of this as i ran out of money :( but hopefully its still there when i go back.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","lisagirl"
1899,"2012-12-13",3.2,"Pours a nice dark amber and has a nice soft creamy head.  Bit of hops on the nose but a little thin on the palate.","NEW ZEALAND","omega"

1899,"2012-05-26",3.1,"On tap, pours amber brown with white head that settles to ring. Aroma of peppermint, thyme, pine and sweet spices. Hoppy floral bitterness is faint. Flavour of spices/ flowers comes through. Light bodied. Easy drinking.","Auckland Central, NEW ZEALAND","Brodies_Best"
1899,"2012-02-10",3.2,"Good session beer. Aroma gave me spaghetti bolognese, which I like... Head was small but long retention, subtle complex fruits on the palate, good amount of hops. Body is a bit watery for me, but easy to drink a few of. Finish is pleasant, nice sweetness and more subtle hops, nothing unpleasant. Served on hand pump at Cassels Brewery Christchurch.","","scrowlerAA"
1899,"2012-02-04",4.1,"had this poured from handpump at Ruakura, nice head.  nice hop bittering with it being not over the top.  Nice red to amber colour with a creamy taste.  Not a big fan of creamy beers but hop flavour balance this out nicely.","NEW ZEALAND","kiwi_daz"
1899,"2012-01-12",3.2,"Good amber colour although a little hazy. Very little head from pouring (clean glass too). Smells of orange blossom and other good malt aromas, malt biscuits and crackers. Almost savoury aroma underneath the citrus fruit. Plenty of carbonation in the mouth and lots more orange, tangelo flavours. Tangy bitterness and good chewy, malty biscuitiness. Not nearly as woody as I was expecting, but maybe I was thinking of fuggles when I saw the label. On second thoughts, it starts to arise in the finish, which develops on the palate. Likeable beer.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
1899,"2011-10-30",3.9,"Pint pulled from Galbraiths Alehouse (Auckland). Sessionable with a capital ABLE! Perfect balanced between the juicy malt and the fruity hops. Could drink this all day.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"
1899,"2011-10-14",3.4,"dark amber color. Tropical fruit and caramel nose. Solid malty backbone, but enough hop notes pop through to make this distinctively non-English. Estery. Moderate bitter finish with hops just sitting in your mouth. Very well made New World take on an English bitter","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
