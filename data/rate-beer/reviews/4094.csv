This one was a lot better than their currant Spontaan Pale & Spontaan Donker, I am inclined to believe that age helped this one. Hazy orange, little brief white head. Nose is dirty barrel, sour old lightly oxidized lambiek, cellar, old lambiek, dirty, smells oddly a bit like an okay qualities 20 year old oxidized geuze, Taste is similar, stale lemon, dirty barn, aspirin, stale almost touch medicinal, old cellar, soap, oxidized lambiek, Oxidized lambiek body. Not the best lambiek ever but a pretty decent one, the current Spontaan editions are another story.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
