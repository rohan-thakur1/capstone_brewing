4263,"2017-06-10",3.7,"750 ml growler, filled 4 hours ago. Thanks going to Adam and heather_B, so much thanks! Ever time I sip this I think about Great Lakes Dortmunder gold Nose of sweet malt, subtle grains and lager yeast. Flavor and aroma goes hand -in-hand. Light sweet and medium sweetness with a backbone of grain, subtle corn. 
Lighter body with a clean finish. The body is almost medium, good crispness. Overall: No brewer has done this style this well since Great Lakes. Wonderful example of the style. Mr. Hill is spot on style guidelines yet again.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
4263,"2017-06-09",3.8,"On tap at HF. Light and clean, with a bit of grain flavor, a really soft mouthfeel, and a quick finish. Like a lighter, easier drinking Mary. Its almost unfair that HF can dominate any style they make.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
4263,"2017-06-04",4.0,"Pours pale gold into a willi. Bright white head with excellent retention recedes to skim surface. Cracked malt and hay aromas. Soft with sweet caramel and hay front to back. Lasting mild bitter earth finish. Nice.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
4263,"2017-06-04",3.9,"1L Glass, via Draft. Pours a hazy yellow, smells great. Fresh roasted nuts, pine needles, orange peel, juicy pineapple. Mouthfeel is dense, filling, well carbonated and has an oily thick finish. Flavor is akin to aroma. It is most certainly a lager but with a little hop profile that makes you want more. I actually ended up having this and a macro Helles side by side and the flavor on this out rageously better.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4263,"2017-06-02",4.0,"750 mL growler. Pale yellow. Smells of a little bit of earthy and spicy hops. Strong bready and doughy malt presence. Tastes bready, spicy, and a touch sweet as the hop flavor dies down. Spicy and earthy hop finish. Light body. Not sure why, but I expected a little more heft and hop from this. Soft carbonation. Its subtle and subdued, which I should have expected from HF.  At first, I thought, yeah ok its just a lager, but a return to it after drinking some HF IPAs made me really appreciate it.  Maybe as a US craft beer drinker I dont get to try many good pilsners and helles lagers, but I still thought this was more enjoyable without being more flavorful.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
4263,"2017-06-02",3.9,"Growler, thanks Collin. Clear pale yellow pour with a small white head. Mild Pilsner bouquet. Lots of flavor and a very good mouthfeel for this style of beer. Its still got that light Pilsner/Lager style flair profile with very mellow biscuit qualitites. Easy drinking with Uber mild hop bitterness.","Florida, USA","50belair"
4263,"2017-06-01",3.8,"Draft at Prohibition Pig. Ive already spent enough on beer in the last two days to last me a year, but what kind of a RBian would I be if I didnt tick a few more before bed? Clear pale pour, small white ring of head, okay retention, irregular lacing. Smells nice - biscuit, corn, light honey. Good clean and smooth. Medium sweetness, short finish. Feels soft in the way these HF beers often seem to. Light body, pleasant carbonation. Easy to crush. Feels basically like a non-aggressive pilsner.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
4263,"2017-05-31",3.3,"Growler @ the office. Pours a clear golden colour with a small white head. Nose is a sweet bready malts. Flavour is crisp, bready, slight sweet, refreshing. Not bad.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"
4263,"2017-05-31",3.9,"Growler, sent from wilco (thanks a lot, Mike!), pours a clear blonde with a small white head. Aroma is super fresh, with lots of herbaceous notes, light grass and biscuity malt. Flavour is likewise fresh, with lots of herbaceous notes, biscuity malt, a touch of hay and light grass. Fresh, correct dryness and light grass. For the style, lovely.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Refreshing. It is very nice if you like this style, but its just not my thing :-)","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"
4263,"2017-05-15",4.1,"Growler from Al at Ryans May 2017 tasting; several drafts throughout the city. Pours a clear golden body with light white ring of lace. Nose is clean, crisp corn, pale malt and lager-notes. Faint hops waft to the nose. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp and sessionable - slightly hopped lager with absolutely no flaws. Damn.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
4263,"2017-05-15",3.8,"Pours a very clear golden with a small white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is of honey malt and herbs/noble hops. Taste is more of the noble hops with crispy cereals in the back. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate. A bit thin perhaps but it is even more easy drinking because of that. Overall a nice and crisp german style beer. Not americanized in any way to me and just really, really good.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
