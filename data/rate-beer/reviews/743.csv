743,"2012-09-23",4.3,"66cl bottle courtesy of and split with 77ships @ Delirium Hoppy Loft. Thanks Eugène, a truly marvelous beer and one of the highlights of the night.
Dorée/orangée foin sur un léger trouble, col blanc.
Arôme est très subtile avec en ce qui me concerne un whisky présent mais qui ne déteint pas comme trop présent. Note boisée, de barrique et whisky, le tout complété par un bouquet fruité tropical présentant une fine pointe levure et daigreur fruitée.
Palais est doux et soyeux même à 9.5%. Ici aussi, le whisky est léger et nentame pas le profile généreux du froment, levure mais surtout de cette rondeur fruitée qui titille le palais, laissant transparaître des notes de mangues, pêche. Alcool reste bien placé sans dominer et au final une pointe épicée venant des houblons et du bois ponctue le tout.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Very slightly sweet grain with modest Belgian finish. Almost no carbonation. The wood is well apparent, it is very musty, not very delicious for triple, kind of a strange mash up. Different for sure. The rye oak throws it for a loop with a heavy musty funk, and while it doesn?t ruin the beer it doesn?t do a lot to compliment it.","Raytown, Missouri, USA","freeofthoughts"
