1804,"2016-08-25",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting at Andrews house on August 18. 500 mL bottle. The pour is a darker cola color with a thin khaki head that lingers as a ring. The aroma is surprisingly boozy. There is a hint of chocolate and a very light coconut, but its much more reserved than I thought it would be. There is a little bit of charred oak in there, but its just not what I was hoping for. The flavor, however, is spectacular. The chocolate and coconut explode on your taste buds like a Mounds bar. There is a light vanilla present, a good oak offering, and a hint of alcohol. This is legitimately like a bourbon dipped Mounds bar. Jesus H. The mouth feel is thinner and light with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly chocolate and coconut dominated aftertaste. This one started off a little weak, but damn did it kick up a notch!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1804,"2015-08-08",3.5,"On draught at Brewers Fork, 7/30/15.Similar to the PBJ framinghammer, this was dark, deep and opaque. Had a bit more tan head, but it still disappeared pretty rapidly.More adjunct apparency in this one than the PBJ, with sweet, fruity coconut mixing nicely with an earthy, almost spicy cacao note to produce a pretty vibrant nose, replete with milk chocolate maltiness, candied prunes and vanilla. Big and filling, it masks any potential booziness.Sweet, candy/toffee-like flavors, with juicy, bold coconut flavors and soft, vaguely spicy cacao notes that meld with the malt to give a very chocolatey character. Creamier, with more carbonation than the PBJ, but its a bit sweeter all-around too and does get a bit fatiguing towards the end. Still, alcohol is well-masked and the adjuncts are done honorably here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

En bouche, jai limpression dun corps moyen-fort avec un pétillement ajusté et une texture presque soyeuse.
