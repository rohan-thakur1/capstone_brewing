731,"2017-05-05",3.6,"Can (473 ml) at home, split 2-ways. Thanks to mathieuc for this one! Clear golden with a medium white head, some retention, leaving some lacing. Aroma is a bit dull with floral hops, rye pepperiness and hints of fruits. Taste is similar with floral presence, peppery rye, light resin and moderate bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Fluffy mouthfeel. Peppery rye finish that lingers a bit. The mouthfeel is nice and the beer is not too heavy, but I thought it was a bit dull. The aroma isnt explosive at all and the rye takes too much place for my liking.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
731,"2017-04-26",3.8,"Pours a very clear golden with a medium white head that leaves nice patterns on the glass. Nose is of piny hops with a moderate fruit character in the back. Taste is pretty much a continuity with a moderately high bitterness. Not too sweet at all. Body is medium, carbonation moderate and mouthfeel is a oily. A fine rye IPA!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
731,"2017-01-29",3.5,"Pours a pretty small layer of bubbly head that just leaves a ring inside of glass and has a typical golden appearance. Has ok lacing. Aromas of grains, nuts, citrus hops and a bit bready and mild corn scent. Flavours are largely hop influenced, citrus blend of oranges, mandarins and a dash of lemons. Some notes of rye comes through, as well as some hints of caramel and sweet malts. Well balanced hops and malts fusion. Mild creamy and puckering mouthfeel, a little bitter. Medium bodied. Smooth and goes down easy at 6.2%abv. Pretty good stuff.","Winchester, Ontario, CANADA","AleRider78"
731,"2016-12-03",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Grapefruit, flowers and spicy rye thrive in this bubbly New World IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A large head of foam settles atop the hazy blond.
-Hop character is rich and complex.
-Juiciness is only diminished by the relatively high carbonation.
-Resinous bitterness is moderate for the style. This one focuses on aroma and flavour.
-Cereals offer lightly honeyed sugars.

731,"2016-06-02",4.1,"Un beau visuel doré penchant sur l'orangé remplit le verre en compagnie d'une mousse épaisse et compacte. Des vagues poivrées jouent avec des parfums enivrants d'agrumes pour former un bouquet très invitant. La texture est moelleuse en bouche et le seigle est fusionnel avec les saveurs fruitées et la délicate amertume. Magnifique.

731,"2016-04-13",3.5,"Un peu trop timide au nez, les notes sont toutefois intrigeantes... Le seigle à loeuvre, probablement! Le liquide est très joli, dune doré assuré, et la petit mousse se veut prèsque crémeuse. En bouche, cest agréable, le seigle est ici aussi présent, mais il manque le punch auquel je mattendais. Cest un tantinet trop mince à mon goût, seule la mousse semble avoir une consistance respectable. Cela dit lamertûme est bien dosée et lalcool est, encore une fois pour BTP, merveilleusement bien caché.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","electrotype"
731,"2016-04-08",3.9,"Pours a medium lasting foamy head atop a cloudy orange body. Nose of rye and hops. Very bitter, good rye flavour. Nicely balanced. Another great beer.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
731,"2016-03-27",3.8,"473 mL can. Beautiful orange-copper colour, beautiful white head, beautiful pour. Mild, soft, sweet citrus in the nose, with a hint of rye spice underneath. The rye is a little muted in the flavour as well, but its there. Not to the extent Id like, though, Its more of an aftertaste. The bitterness is more APA than IPA, but that makes the beer frighteningly sessionable.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"

Bone dry, verging on thin, with a lasting bitter backbone. Moderate to full bodied with average carbonation.

Le nez est granuleux, fruité par ses houblons, aromatisé par le seigle, doux avec ses notes caramélisés et piqué par des aiguilles de pin. Le goût est laffaire des houblons et du seigle. Les saveurs dagrumes et de conifères sont aussi poivrées par les céréales. Cest bien bon. Au palais, le corps est huileux tandis que les bulles sont fines et explosives.

Nose is tons of fresh hops: tropical fruit, citrus, a bit of pine, along with a bit of bready malt. Taste follows perfectly, with a really nice pine/bitter grapefruit finish. I didnt pick up as much rye flavour/spice as I wouldve liked, but its still got a solid malt character, with a great hop profile. Very nice.","Quebec, CANADA","HippyHop"
