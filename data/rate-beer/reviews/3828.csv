3828,"2016-06-01",4.1,"750mL bottle shared by AdamC on 5/22/16, much thanks!Great pour with a gentle haze in this brilliant, goldenrod yellow body. White head atop is large and shows moderately strong-to-strong retention. Plentiful carbonation visible.Really charming, extremely easygoing nose showcases light lemon, vanilla, cream-of-wheat, very mild lactic notes and gentle wood notes. It really comforts the nose, with a big minerality and sublime funk that doesnt scream cowshit but rather a recently cleaned, sun-drenched barn, baking in the heat. But also add lemon....WHAP! Holy hell, was not prepared for that based on the nose. Burst of lemon, with a concentrated, puckeringly sour lactic character that takes you completely by surprise. I dont think Ive ever seen such a disparity between the nose and flavor of a beer. That being said, Im not upset with sourness and though it is enamel-cleaning and very eye-opening, its fun and ""balanced"" by a honey-like maltiness and tons of oat and wheat texture (""chewiness""). Tight carbonation produces a near-creaminess, as well and there is no alcohol or flaw. Lots of lemon and mild funk working well together. Light, overall with a strong attenuation and light to moderate oak character.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

S - Smells really nice. Really juicy orange juice with a light bit of honey and dry white wine.

T - Very dry, loads of yeasty goodness with a mild tartness that starts in the middle and continues long into the finish. The flavor is seriously spot on. I feel like this is some sort of lemon-forward sarrasin with bits of hoppy bitterness finishing with orange peel, honey and some ginger.
