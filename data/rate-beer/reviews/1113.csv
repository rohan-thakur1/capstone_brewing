1113,"2016-11-10",3.8,"Batch 2, bottled 10/10/15, drunk 11/5/16.Lime-brass-tinted golden with good clarity and a medium-sized, white head that fizzles to a ring rather quickly.Juicy, indeed, in the nose, though having sat in the bottle for over a year, the juiciness is now provided by the brett and lactic acids. There is still some remnant of juicy hop notes, I believe, and the sum total aroma is very full of lime, nectarine, kumquat, gooseberry and yogurt cultures. Quite sniffable with light honey and biscuit malt character behind it. No alcohol. Maybe a touch over-acidic.In the mouth its both malty and very lactic. So it balances pretty nicely, but with a high amount of acidity lingering. Woody, lactic and with some hop bitterness lingering, as well. Very low carbonation but mostly tight/engaging. Quite nice, enjoyable stuff, though the lactic acid gets pretty strong over the course of the beer, unbalancing things slightly. A little bit monotonous but very good, nonetheless.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1113,"2016-07-14",4.0,"Batch 2. Merci à moi de mavoir partagé cette bouteille que je me suis domé comme un champion par ce bel après-midi de célébrations chez les Hexagonais. Du fond de mon ballon Hill Farmstead rempli de ce légendaire liquide à la robe bien ambrée et cristalline, jaillit une quantité impressionnante de fines bulles, à la manière dun vin mousseux. Les célébrations nationales se poursuivent jusque dans mon verre dirait-on. Cette myriade de fines bulles ne suffit pas à alimenter cette mousse, dabord jolie, qui en un clin doeil sest évanouie en ne laissant sur mon verre que de timides vestiges de son passage. En approchant mon grand nez fouineur de ma généreuse coupe, je ne tarde pas à en respirer de puissantes arômes de vin blanc, dune culture microbienne diversifiée, de fruit orange et de raisin vert, le tout bien composté dans une barrique autoritaire et suintante du vin qui rougit en ce moment même les joues de nos cousins français occupés à faire la fête. Les malts, trop souvent laissés pour contre lorsquil est question de bières sauvages, jouent à mon avis un rôle clé dans cette bière en apportant un contre-poids indispensable à cette pompeuse barrique très sûre delle-même. Un filme dhuile me tapisse les joues alors le bois fait tempête. Acidité modérée et bien balancée par les malts (que je salue à nouveau bien bas). Je sens cette puissante bière me colorer les joues.

1113,"2014-11-14",4.4,"Bottle, thanks so much Mike for busting out the heavy hitters last night. Glad to finally revisit this after nearly 2 years. Aroma is mega grapefruit rind, overripe tropical fruit, lots of lime, pink grapefruit pith, subtle oak, RUSTIC, dusty earthy brett. There is noticeable funk, but grapefruit and lime are the dominate aromas. The beer pours cloudy amber/orange with fizzy off white head that sizzles out pretty quickly. Taste is dominated by grapefruit rind with moderate bitter quality towards the end. Lime is present as well, with fruity brett, overripe fruit funk, tangerines, oak tannins. The body is light, with medium-high carbonation, dry bitter finish, medium astringency. Aftertaste is pepper, grapefruit, melon and faint wine. Overall, the brett, fruit and oak work very well together with extreme depth, but I am surprised to see this beer have bitterness to it after almost 2 years.

1113,"2014-10-29",4.3,"In short: A complex and highly drinkable amber ale with superb farmhouse-funk character. Excellent wild ale.
How: Bottle 375ml, twice, one bottle fresh and one bottle 10 months old, different beer, I preferred the dryer aged bottle that Im rating here.
The look: Cloudy glowing amber body topped by a small white head.
In long: WARNING: My aged bottle was a moderate gusher. Nose is moderately wild with a farmhouse bretty character that is very much barnyard. Aroma also has tropical fruits and some fun aged cheddar undertones. In mouth the beer has a medium+ body size, a texture that is somewhat chewy-doughy, a lively carbonation with very soft bubbles, an overall very comfortable mouthfeel. The aged bottle was less fruity and juicy (pardon the pun) than the fresh one but I loved its dryness and the stronger farmhouse character. This one doesnt seem to be developing the signature tartness of many other HF wild beers, this is a pure wild ale, not your usual Sour/Wild Ale by ratebeer standards, nothing sour here, this beer is actually quite sessionnable. I drank my last bottle of Juicy and now my heart is broken I repeated for a third time to the man who kept saying sir, this is 911, whats your emergency?.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1113,"2013-10-01",4.7,"Bottle opened 6/22/13, poured into a HF taster glass.

A-Upon opening, this one is a bit of a gusher. Nothing bad, but if I hadnt started pouring the beer would have gone all over the table. It pours dark copper verging on red with effervescent carbonation running throughout the beer. It is very cloudy from some yeast sediment that got kicked up from the gushing bottle. A two inch fluffy white head falls a little over the first minute, but remains on top of the beer throughout the entire glass. Some yeast sediment settles at the bottom of the glass.

S- Lactic acidity as well as brett is apparent on the nose. Grapefruit and citrus is also there, although I cant tell if it is from the hops or bugs. There is a very interesting barnyard/musty note as well, most likely from the brett. 

T- Up front is some phenolic brett, although right away the flavor is dominated by a grapefruit juice like flavor that immediately dries everything out. There is a tiny bitter note on the end, although with the complexities in this beer, it is easy to miss. 

M- It starts out extremely effervescent, with high carbonation, but not over the top. There is medium body that sits right where I want it for a beer like this- not too over the top, but still apparent enough. After you swallow, your mouth is immediately dried out, and without another sip will remain that way for quite a while! This beer encourages you to keep drinking it. 

O- Incredibly complex beer from start to finish. I was expecting more hop flavors, but It seemed like the bugs have really taken over on the flavor front of things, making for a very interesting wild ale. The only real fault I see with this beer is that I dont have another to age out and see how it develops over time.","","justforrazors"
1113,"2013-09-12",3.9,"Notes from Saturdays tasting.
Aroma is fairly hop forward with lots of citrus and lighter notes of tropical fruit, melon and white grapes. Faint phenolics and light oak character.
Pours a cloudy orange with a thin white head that shows average retention and light lacing.
Flavor is fairly juicy with moderately high tropical fruit and citrus juice. Lighter notes of melon and white wine. Moderately high bitterness. Faint phenolic yeast character.
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Noticeable light hop astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. The hop astringency could be attributed to the fact that this was the first hoppy beer of the evening and a bit of a shock to the palate.
Overall a fairly enjoyable beer, but also one of my lesser enjoyed beers of the evening. While I thought the flavors all worked together and the beer was indeed juicy, I feel like we have moved away from the delicateness that I find so enjoyable about the Hill Farmstead beers. Its almost like the hops hid all my favorite parts of Seans beers.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Light warmth to finish, some bitter orange rind, musty barnyard, more dry wood, poop, pine needles, tangerine, melon. Delicious stuff overall.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1113,"2013-04-14",4.3,"375mL thanks to a generous BA. Pours clear, bright orange. Weaker, acid cut foam. Nose is actually very juicy, so much fresh guava, Goya guava paste, rich and plump papaya. Bright and forward nectar fruits with clearly distinguishable house yeast reminiscent of Civil Disobedience and their other saison series. Taste is zesty, still hoppy, fresh tangerine and guava paste. Palate is quenching, buoyant. So good, but this beer beckons for large gulps but since it is so rare, youll be sharing it probably. But then it comes in a 375mL bottle, and there just isnt enough to get that super refreshing gulp that it deserves.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

1113,"2013-04-07",4.1,"375ml bottle. Nice... Pours a hazy deeper golden copper penny consistency throughout and topped with a creamy fluffy white head that reduces down to a thin wispy film... Aroma of floral bitterness with pear fruit accents. Somewhat milky creamy feel to it. Hops still present but that floralness just runs rampant in the nicest way imaginable... Flavors are a continuation of the same with pear and white grapes with some floral aspects that add to its enjoyment. Medium fluffy mouthfeel with just the right level of carbonation. Drinks nicely all around. Splendid.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

1113,"2013-02-24",4.2,"From a bottle, pours a glowing peach with a soapy white head.  Wicked globs of brown yeast were stuck to the cap and bottle neck.  Nose is really wine forward, with lots of stone fruit, tropical fruit, grassy hops, lots of bugs and wild yeast.  Mouth is sharp upfront with a dryer feel than I expected.  Still lots of wine barrel and wild yeast throughout the palate, but a really nice dry champagne quality that I enjoy a lot.  Carbonation is sharp.  Lots of green apple and bright citrus expression emerge.  Grassy and yeasty to a degree, but light and dry.  I personally prefer less overt wine barrel in these kinds of beers, but this is darn good.  Probably not quite Ann level.  Actually drinks similarly to a really nice bottle of Orval, like 1-2 years old.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

1113,"2013-01-25",4.6,"Huge, huge thanks to Evan for this one. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

Slow gusher as I pop the cap. Nothing big, but have a glass at the ready. Pour yields a deep peach-colored brew with a nice two-finger white head. Good retention and plenty of lacing as it goes down. Thin cap throughout.

The initial nose provides a good dose of honeydew alongside tropical fruit. Mild funk and white-wine character in the background. Touch of citrus rind and very light straw.

Flavor is incredible. Absolutely fantastic. Notes of melon and white wine overlay a very light acidity. Just a touch of oak in the background as well as some mild underlying Brett. 

Body is light with a mild underlying bitterness. Acidity is quite light and is more along the lines of a mild citrus character rather than straight lactic acid. Theres a touch of creaminess in the background. Perhaps not creamy, but just a bit of wheat character. 

Overall, on the level with the best Hill Farmstead beers. Phenomenal, to say the least. Can we officially name Hill Farmstead the best brewery in the world?",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

Pours a hazy and dull golden amber with a thin off white head. Acidic aroma of lemon and wine with some leafy tropical hops and grass. Medium thick body with soft carbonation and a long lasting orange pulp/resin and leafy hop finish. Bright flavor of orange peel, lemon, grass, white wine and bready malt. Notes of Mimosas citrus flavor are present but tempered in a welcomed way.

Juicy is appropriately named; highly citric base delivers a mouthful of tangerines ready to be zapped by the microflora remnants. Dangerously close to Mimosa.

Taste is tart, green sour Apple rhind mixed with brett, pear,and slight sweetness of pineapple.

I had to pry the glass away from my wife who typically strongly dislikes ""sour"" beers.  Ive been telling her that mimosa would turn her into a HF junky but juicy did the trick.  Now the hunt is on to find more","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"

I mean do these guys make a beer that isnt the best of its style? If they do, I am unaware of it. Holy shit this is so amazing and deliciously hoppy/fruity.

1113,"2012-12-13",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2012 A beer reminiscent and comparable to the happy accident that was the original Cuvee de Castleton.

1113,"2012-12-12",4.2,"Pours a deep dirty hazy orange with a nice off white bubbly head. Spotty lacing, and a head that dissolves to a persistent foamy ring around the edges. Aroma is very juicy; spicy, fruity hops (citrus, papaya, mangos), stinky feet, wine, oak, barnyard funk, and bacterial sour/tartness. Taste is very similar however more bitterness comes through in the taste. Definitely highly hopped or high alpha hop varieties used. Lots of citrus and vinous flavors. Tart, funky. Very nice texture to this beer, high carbonation, dry, crisp but very drinkable. I wish this were a 750ml! Overall, excellent.","Seattle, Washington, USA","julian"
1113,"2012-11-28",4.5,"375mL bottle, sent from Glouglouburp (thanks a lot, Dany), pours a cloudy, opaque deep orangey amber with a small-ish beige head. Nose brings out the wine barrels on top, with wild yeast moderately apparent that might be more potent in a few months. Flavour brings out some moderate tartness, a fairly prominent wild yeast character even though this is a young brett beer, white wine barrels, and a dry finish of hops similar to Nelson Sauvin or some other NZ variant. So much depth to this, mixing the brettanomyces and white wine barrels to utter perfection, giving off only a mild tartness. This could be classified as either a wild ale or saison. Probably my favourite farmhouse ale by Hill Farmstead so far. Wonderful.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1113,"2012-11-25",4.4,"LIVE RATE! Single 375 mL bottle purchased from the brewery yesterday noontime. Oddly enough, there was a line but it wasnt too big so I dealt; HF employees pours $5 that got you four pours. It was one helluva drive, but sincerely worth it. Pours a deeply dark orange with an eruptive, legging off-white head sitting atop. Damn sexy but nothing I havent seen before. Smells incredibly fragrant, showcasing notes of blood orange, coconut oil, dank hops, Kalamata olives, farmhouse yeasts, brief funkiness, grapefruit zest, prickly pear and daisies. I actually have to stand back, the tastes are so fascinatingly intense... okay, firstly I get dank citrus hops resembling chives and marijuana in flavor; honeydew melon, an assault of wild and Belgian yeasts, daisies, wheat malt, a tangerine/grapefruit combination, sage, lavender and burnt plastic. Starts and ends briny, flowery, citrusy and tart.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"

Eathen bretty cheesecloth, melon, cantaloupe, papya, and cherry pie in the aroma give way to doughy bready super acidic funk, huge tropical fruit character, and a strong backbone of melon. Hints of oak in the finish. The palate holds frothy prickling effervescence with a pillowy mouthfeel and uber dry finish. Reminded me a lot of the base saison character in Civil Disobedience 4.5- huge melon and tropical flavors abound. Another stellar farmhouse ale that demonstrates the unmistakable Hill Farmstead funk character while having some definite uniqueness to make it stand out against its brothers.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
1113,"2012-11-14",4.6,"12oz (375ML) Bottle enjoyed in a tasting glass at room temperature on 11/14/12.

A - Cloudy muted orange appearance with a few ""floaties"" due to a vigorous pour. A mild 1 finger fluffy pillow-like white head that faded to a minor level of head that remained throughout the drink. 

S - The best aroma from a beer Ive ever encountered. The depth is remarkable. Overall, Brett dominates the nose. This barnyard  irrefutable  Brett aroma is unmistakable. Its present and there to impress. Hints of lemon, oranges and white wine are present as well. 

T - Tart from start to finish. Bready and Bretty throughout. Hints of grape skins, melon, cucumbers and sweet orange zest with a handful of grape skins. The tartness is so pleasurable and would be perfect on a hot summer day. Its not sour..just tart. The very common taste of Shaun Hills Saisons is easy to detect. Like Arthur, Anna and their barrel aged versions of those two saisons, this beer is very close. Perhaps most similar to a ""juicy"" version of Flora? Thats probably the best way to describe it. 

M - Medium body and carbonation. Exceptional balance and enjoyable now. id love to try this again in 6 months to see how it progresses. 

O - Is it the best wild ale Ive had from Shaun HIll? No. For tart characters and overall quality, Id say Mimosa, Flora and Art take the cake. However, Juicy is unique. It stands on its own and its perfect in its own way. Is it like other HFS beers? Sort of. The terroir of the Hill Farmstead is strong in this one but its unique and you cant assume its exactly like other barrel aged beers from this tiny brewery in Vermont. Its a fantastic beer and one that I wish was available in 750ML bottles. 375 is just enough to make you beg for more.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
