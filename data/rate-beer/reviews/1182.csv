Having never tried this before surprised me when it was delivered to the table. Despite an odd pairing choice that it completely swamped I enjoyed this excellent imperial IPA. As long as it sticks to its roots I cant see it ever being completely edged out of the market - especially with what the Surly brand has become.

Aroma / Appearance - A golden bronze base packs the punch you would expect. Walloping the nose with nothing short of pure weapons grade hops it scours the sinuses clean with zero attempt at subtlety. If big massive IPAs are your thing this delivers in spades.

Flavor / Palate - Lemon custard, zest, and an urgent bitter sensation gnaw at the palate like gritty sandpaper. It manages to build even after you think theres no way for it to become more intense. The expertise to stop just short of total fatigue demonstrates a deft touch that is the only subtle thing about this world class imperial IPA.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Bigger citrus hop in the flavor, spicier hop, big dank resiny hop. Very mild malt character, just a touch of caramel maybe.. But this is a hop feature for sure. Nice grapefruit comes out later. Bigger bitter taste, but its not at all astringent nor out of balance. Not overly dry like many modern DIPAs can be. Theres a nice lighter to moderate sweetness here too, that helps balance the taste and keep this drinkable. Medium to bigger body, drinks easier than your typical 9% DIPA, more like an 8% IPA.

1182,"2015-11-24",3.8,"Abrasive? I do that well, according to certain folks in my life who think that the best way to live your life is to keep the frosting thick. Well, Im not a fan of sugar coating very much of anything, and I LIKE the idea of keeping it real. Lets see how real this Abrasive Ale from Surly Brewing goes down.
- This beer is poured into a tulip glass, the color of ginger-spices and capped with a frothy, off-white head about two inches in depth. The brew pours slightly thick and I foresee a pair of sticky lips for me tonight. The aroma looms large, and I inhale the scent of mango, tangerine, and heady clover with a bit of faint pine in the background. Ive been waiting all day for a beer, and Im not messing with you, I need this now. So, I tip the glass, draw at the brew, fill my mouth and swallow.
- Mmm...the flavor mirrors the aroma, theres a slight bite to the initial taste, but its very nicely balanced. Although the beer is creamy, there is little of the stickiness I expected, but it spins intricate webs across the span of the glass as I drink it down. I love the feel of it, and the viscosity really carries the flavors well through the finish.
- It definitely sticks around, but doesnt fade out to a tasteless, flat bitter in my mouth either. A very nice DIPA, Very flavorful, consistent and with a great texture. Id make this a staple in my house if I had it locally, and without a doubt, Id be introducing it to my beer loving friends! *Addendum: There is a little bit of sticky on the corners of my lips...still, not what I was expecting.","USA","lightbias"

Pours an orange-amber color, with a half finger broad, white head.

Intriguing aromas of grass, lime, pineapple and biscuity, sweeter malts. Due to the prominent malts, the fruity hops melt well into the beers sweetness, evoking aromas of juicy ananas dipped into honey, with a prikly kiwi peak to it. 

Lively, slightly metallic mouthfeel, highlighting the citrus qualities of the beer.

Tastes of citrus, with a dank quality to it and balancing, earthy malts. This is bursting with hops, unleashing a very bitter, slightly tropical onslaught, almost overpowering my palate. It does not, because of glazed malts, providing nothing more but a basic malt presence, letting the hops shine big times. Finishes with an immense, dry bitterness, accentuating citrus hops, which stay on the tongue for a very long time.

Pine and honey, accompanied by a subtle metallic hint, resulting from the carbonation, interact incredible well with the tongue numbing citrus bitterness, tranforming the taste more and more into a tropical fruit direction, due to the distinct, honeyed malts infusion. This beer is truly abrasive, while it highlights all the positive characteristics of a well composed IIPA. Its versatile in taste, while it provides a merciless bitterness, wrapped up by citraic fruits and honeyed malts.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1182,"2014-06-26",4.1,"Rcvd in trade. Two cans.

The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and added a nice sweet maltiness coating my taste buds.

1182,"2014-03-27",4.0,"Canned January 21, 2014.
Appearance: The body is hazy with fine sediment particles in suspension in the straw-orange hued body. The head is dense and messy, forming small craters as it slowly dissipates into a firm white coating.
Aroma: The aroma is very nice, mango and orange juice come to mind instantly with a sharp but hidden pine and bitter orange only shown upon swirling.
Taste: Big flavor here, malts try to meet hops here, but the hops win. The hops give a big orange juice and mango puree flavor. Floral hints and pine are noticed throughout, while the finish is a bit harsh of hops, but in an enjoyable way. Big grapefruit finish.
Palate: Full-bodied with a velvet texture and mild carbonation.
Overall: I think that this is up there with the best. Im sure this was even better a month ago when I received it, but thanks to a cold then antibiotics I wasnt able to get to it until today. This sits up there with Heady Topper for me, the mouthfeel is spot on and the hop profile is great. I will be trying to get this again soon!","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Mouth is full bodied and creamy up front, with a massive wallop of tropical fruity hops (and also some peach and melon notes as well) and mild bitterness, the malts are sort of distinguishable (but this is a hop warhead so they take a backseat) then a medium sweetness creeps in, followed by a mildly bitter finish that lingers.

A: 16oz can wrapped in aluminum foil and topped with standard pull tab. So I pulled the tab and poured out some honey colored ale. Maybe a drop of vamp blood in there, but pretty washed-out. Transient fine white foam finds resolve as a thin, broken sheet of a surface - but collared. Quantity of lace is equivalent to a Paris Hilton personal film: none. (3.5)

S: Hops. IPA. Grapefruit among other citric rinds. Slightly sweet nose candy of a malt profile. Im guessing that theres quite a bite to this one. An unbaked bread smell - doughy. I keep thinking I can smell more and more...tangerine? Excited. (3.5)

T: The dough is the first thing I taste. Then flanking of bitter and spicy hops roll over my palate and the beer may even be over douching the beer with hops. Tannic. As the beer warms up the bitterness dies out a bit and the beer becomes relatively sweet. (4)

M: Medium body with low carbonation. Dry finish only slight heat (guessing ABV in the 7% range). I think maybe my teeth dislike this beer - the enamel is flecking off. (3.5)

O: Still guessing IPA and this one is sweet and definitely drinkable. Actually reminds me of Dales Pale Ale (also an IPA).

This is a remarkably well balanced beer, considering the claim of 120 IBUs.

1182,"2013-02-17",4.3,"16oz can courtesy of kscaldef. Thanks! 

A: Light caramel colored with a substantial foam thats resting in the neck of the tulip. Not really enough room to test the legs, and thats OK. 

N: I can smell this from a foot away. Deep whiffs of pineapple, mango, and passionfruit. Some grapefruit, but leans more towards the tropical. Sticky crystallized sugar and a great base for the pine and earthiness. Tour de force, if a bit on the sweet side.

T: Sticky, candied pineapples. More of the tropical mango and passionfruit. Very sweet, but it runs right along the boundary between cloying and just right, alternating between sips. There is that dank base that overloads the pine needles that I dont much appreciate because it stings, but this is really, truly good in spite of a minor flaw.

M: Very sticky. Im not even sure what the body feels like because of the stickiness. Alcohol is quite evident.

O: For being a double IPA, this is more potent than some TIPAs Ive had. Carries a pretty large stick to beat you over the head with, so if youre in the mood for something rough, thisll be perfectly abrasive.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

1182,"2013-02-08",4.3,"I like IPAs with appropriate names and Surly Abrasive is a great example of why. Not quite a textbook example of either a West Coast or East Coast double IPA, but a big beer thats relentless in its bitterness, but still manages to be easy drinking and satisfying. 

I poured a 16oz can into a goblet.

Appearance: Hazy, translucent gold. Forms a large, ivory, frothy head which retains and laces excellently. 

Smell: Light, clean, tropical fruit notes at first, but upon closer inspection theres a strong earthy/herbal scent of resin and pine.

Taste: If you want hops you definitely get them with Surly Abrasive. Theyre here from the moment it hits your tongue until long after the swig is completed. Though the aroma is clean and fruity, the actual flavor is dank and resinous. Intense bitterness envelopes the palate with an almost pine-sap like flavor and character. Theres definitely orange citrus in the palate here as well, but its closer to juice concentrate or syrup than any kind of light, crisp, refreshing taste. Whats interesting is that its never really all that sweet and certainly not cloying. I get some subtle garlic or dry spice flavors on the backend, almost a bit of ""locker room"" funky taste as well which imparts a hint of candy tartness. 

Its a delicious tasting beer for sure, but not quite something Id award my highest grade to because its so unrelenting in its delivery and the flavors that are here, though great, could probably be even better. If I could get this on a regular basis I would, though. 

Drinkability: While Surly Abrasive may be one of the overtly bitter beers Ive ever had, what really makes it memorable is its easy drinkability. The mouthfeel is fairly soft, but lively, with a smooth texture and accompanying finish. Theres no challenge to get this beer down at all despite the fact its pretty hefty at 9% ABV. Still, the alcohol is well masked as I dont smell or taste it at all. The hops do make it rather astringent, so there is noticeable drying of the tongue. This would be a fantastic beer to pair with a spicy meal, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
1182,"2013-02-07",3.9,"Fresh can from burgy.  Thanks again.  Do you like bitter hops, I mean really like bitter hops?  Well this is the DIPA you are.  the strong bitterness really dominates this one.  Bit of a sweetmalty backbone. Had the furious yesterday.  The two are very similar this is just more hop bitter.  I though the furious was touch better because some of the citrius and pine notes shined throgh the bitterness.  never the less this is a very good beer.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
1182,"2013-02-07",4.4,"I had Furious yesterday, and the most succinct review I can give of Abrasive is that it's Surly ""plus,"" better in every way. More malty backbone flavor; more hoppy; higher ABV. However, still amazingly balanced. This is an incredibly good DIPA, better than Pliny the Elder and HopSlam by a tick or two, although my can was not as fresh as the Pliny and 'Slam I've had. If you have access to this, buy it and drink ASAP!

1182,"2013-02-04",4.0,"Aroma is all hops - very fruity with lots of citrus, grapefruit and mandarins mostly. There is also a nice floral note that combines nicely with some tropical fruit, apricot and peach. A very slight resin note is there as well as a faint alcohol aroma. 
Pours a very clear, light golden orange with a slightly off white head that lingers as a thin film on top and thicker on the edges. Light lacing with small legs. 
Flavor starts with a bit of sweet biscuit and cracker malt with a faint caramel note. The malt fades away and the hops come into the picture. Citrus, tropical fruit, stone fruit and a more assertive resin note than in the aroma. Strong, lingering bitterness dries the palate in the finish. A light alcohol note is also found in the finish. The finish has some grapefruit and resin to it as well. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Light hop astringency, but it's not too bad. Moderate alcohol warmth. 
This is one of my favorite Midwest IPAs and this can was only 4 weeks old. The hop character is very assertive and the malt is in the background. Not quite a West Coast IPA but right on the border.

Mouthfeel: thin and smooth with medium carbonation. Overall: de-freaking-licious!  Love the multi layered hoppiness.

Premo price, great to experience once, but only hanging on by a thread due to lack of solid competition in the aggressive IPA arena.Update:  Aroma is a damp, soft, mellow piney citrus with mango.  Taste is fruity again with citrus and some boozy malts coming through at the end.  Aftertaste is good, with a deeper bitterness mixing with the warming from the booze.  Slightly too much booze for 9%.  Super creamy palate that thins with the bitterness at the end, staying sticky.  This is spendy, but pretty good.  -1 Appearance, -1 overall.

Pours clear, light golden orange with huge lasting head and insane lacing.  The second pour to finish off the 16oz can looks incredible.   Aroma is very fruity with lots of citrus, some berries, and a caramel sweetness.  Flavor is sweet malts at first, fading quickly into strong citrus hops and resin.  Bitterness lasts but mellows enough to be enjoyable.  Palate is great.  This is a very good beer, and I don?t factor cost into my ratings.

Pineapple, mango, and a touch of spruce on the nose. Pineapple, mango, and papaya intially, joined by a bit of sweet malt, and balanced with grapefruit rind and piney bitterness. Finishes clean and dry. Fairly fully bodied, moderate carbonation, slick and smooth on the palate. Abrasive is one of my personal favorite DIPAs.

The pine becomes murky into a slight medicinal finish, not a great after taste but still fair.

1182,"2012-03-01",3.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/21/2011.  Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip. 

Out of the can this pours a fairly transparent caramel tangerine color. A huge off-white head practically overflows the tulip, leaving gorgeous lacing on the glass.

A well constructed DIPA is always bursting with hop aroma, and Abrasive is no different. A smooth blend of tropical fruits - I get pineapple and a bit of mango, with softer grapefruit and tangerine as well. The sweetness present is more caramel than candied fruit in nature.

As I gathered from the appearance, the front is caramel malt with some sweetness that balances the soon-to-come hops. Even with a valiant effort, there is no chance the malt holds up. The first few sips are not overwhelming, but as the glass goes on, the hops really dig in. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, mango, and a touch of pine are present in that order of dominance.

This drinks extremely light for the style. Abrasive is not abrasive, it drinks extremely smooth. The tongue eventually becomes withered with the paint-stripping hop goodness, but I enjoy that. 

There is no doubt that I could drink this all night, even though my tongue might not have taste buds by morning. This is an appropriate step up from Furious, which to date is my favorite IPA. There is potential for improvement, but this is a solid offering.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Medium pretty vast white head on top of a clear darker orange colored beer.
Smell loats of hops and fresh fruit, peach, pine, cactus, pine apple, citrus, resin, somelight light sweet and light sweaty.
Taste is a good mix of hops (!) and its good bitter and less fruity character and the grains like barley (malts).
A good mix of hops; citrus, bitter, floral and fruit; abricot, pine, light grapefruit, peach, light barley malted sweaty, good balanced bitterness.
The peach seems to come out even better after a while. Very nice (peach) hop bitterness.
Nice bitter hop fruity aftertaste with a light dry touch to it.
Low carbo, soft mouthfeel (almost silky), full body and a creamy texture.

Lots of fresh pine needles, bright citrus oranges/tangerines/pineapples/grapefruits, tropical fruits and sweet mango, big florals, resins, and some dank herbal notes. The malts are clearly present as well with a nice, biscuity caramel and pale malt backing as well as a light cereal grain. Flavor is similar. Lots of sweet orange pines and resins, tropical fruits and mangos, pineapples, and juicy florals up front before a light, but balancing biscuity caramel malt comes in. The pines and florals grow towards the end along with the juicy fruits, dank herbal hops, and resins while this finishes dry and not overly bitter. Very clean with lots of fruity hops in a lengthy aftertaste. Medium-light, very smooth and soft body with a creamy, moderately lively carbonation.

S: On first sniff this was very reminiscent of HopSlam with large blasts of grapefruit and a honey undercurrent. With each successive sniff I got more pineapple, mango and tropical fruits. A dense vegetative component also started to come out, not so much piney, but like trees in the fall.

Pine, pine pine, resinous hops for days.  Hints of caramel malt crept in and out.  Just about blasted with lightly sweet big piney hops, you can feel the oils on your tongue.

T - Starts off with lot of citrus hop flavor and bitterness. There is also some supporting light caramel malts around. Through the middle, some stronger bitterness and some piney hop flavor jumps out. Also some light apricot and other fruits.

1182,"2011-05-07",4.1,"Many cans thanks to mattyb83 and kbutler1! I only give this one a 9 out of 10 on aroma simply because I know there has to be something that smells better than this so I cant quite do the perfect score but it so much deserves it. (Yes, stupid rational.) Tons of pine, citrus and just goodness waft from the glass.  Appearance is a golden orange with a nice head but can get a bit unruly if you are too aggressive.  The taste is outstanding.  The flavors of citrus and pine just burst on to the for front of your tongue and you get even a bit of dankness near the middle until the perfect amount of sweet bitterness comes through to finish things off.   Even the palate of this one resonates in your mouth but not enough to be annoying.  It does a very nice job of coating your mouth but not being overly syrupy.  

Overall, the best beer from a can, ever.  I hate that I even have to use the can in this rating as this stands up to any DIPA out there hands down.  They just need to produce more of this and distribute to Southern California and youd have the beer store guys having to put up signs saying, ""No Abrasive Today!"" instead of ""No Pliny Today!""

Appearance : Hazy amber small head. Light lacing.

Aroma : Awesome fruity notes with awesome malt and light honey. Great floral and piny notes too.

Taste : Very fruity and malty. Light floral notes. Finish is quite bitter but not very resinous. Quite fruity with light floral notes. 

Overall : I know this is not so fresh anymore. Nose is still very nice. Great malt and great fruity and floral hops. The type of profile that I like. Maybe a bit weak on hops but thats most likely because of the age. Taste is also very nice but a bit weak on the hops too. Alcohol is not so well hidden but again this is probably because of the hops weakness. Overall a very nice DIPA but probably only the shadow of what it can be.

1182,"2011-04-22",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Biscuity cereals are a diving board for this Double IPAs expressive oranges and resins, building a smashing pint of Americana. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the hazy amber.
-Malts also provide delicate caramel angles.
-Although this is intensely flavorful, it is not nearly as abrasive as many Double IPAs out there which are just a ton of hops thrown into a boring strong ale. This flavor profile is actually well thought out and the malts are as important as their aromatic counterparts. 
-Alcohol is not a bother as it is smothered in hop bitterness (which doesnt feel harsh, by the way).
-The mouthfeel is simply gorgeous; nourishing yet easygoing. Carbonation and residual sugars are perfectly balanced too.

Pungent, musky aroma of hops in the nose of the citris variety; with mainly orange and grapefruit undertones. Medium/hevy mouthfeel.

Appearance: golden-amber with a very faint haze; thick, rocky head with great retention and lots of lacing.  After 10 minutes, theres still a huge hunk of foam in the glass.  Flavor has multiple layers of hops; fruity, citrus flavors come in first, lots of grapefruit.  Bitterness is fairly high, coming in mid-taste and lingering for quite a while.

Taste is bitter hops up front, light grainy notes in the middle, and some sweet malt/alcohol through the finish.

1182,"2011-03-03",4.1,"<first release spring 2010 version>
Appearance: poured from a can. Has a nice copper color. Amber hues. a small white fluffy head, about 1/2 inch builds on the top of the beer. reduces down to a white film that covers the top of the beer.

Smell: I take a big wiff of this guy waiting for the hops to pound my nostrils like a hammer. nah, I got some piney smell, a bit of citrus but not a ton. I got a huge waft of malt sweetness. caramely. some grassy notes and a wee hair of that pungent onion/garlicness.

Taste: First taste, pine tastes followed by tons of malt backbone and sweetness. that carrys it to the back end of this beer where small bits of citrus comes through, but barely any and then finished by hop bitterness, the finish on this is very similar to Furious.

Mouthfeel is good, this is a smooth beer, no harshness. just rolls over the tongue. easy to drink even with 9% ABV. no real hint of that alcohol in here at all. buried by sweetness and hops.

overall, I think the balance in this beer isnt the best, not that it is too unbalanced but that it actually isnt as hop forward as i thought it would be. Too much malt and sweetness, not enough flavor hops and aroma hops. I think it falls short. its like a malty version of Furious. Hype killed me on this one, guess i was expecting some amazing dIPA that could compete with the best. I dont think it does. Still a great brew but i think i would be hard pressed to call it a top 10 dIPA.

Id drink this with spicy thai food. food that isnt too rich, but has a spicy bite, the beer has plenty of richness from malt on its own. or maybe a nice spicy hot Spring Roll would pair up beautifully with Abrasive.","Bloomington, Minnesota, USA","SourNotes"
1182,"2011-02-26",4.1,"Poured from a can all the way to the top of a shaker pint glass. Barely any head which is why it didnt fall over the edge. Amber in color with a tiny white head.
Sweet malt overpowered by big beautiful wafts of hoppy goodness. Smells of Cascade, but it might be Simcoe, as these two are pretty similar.
Hops up front with a slight residual sweetness. Well balanced example of an IPA. 
Coats the mouth with the above tastes that last well into the next sip. Doesnt tire the taste buds like overly hopped beers can.

Pours a dark golden orange color with golden apricot/burnt orange hues when held to a light and a frothy, pillowy two finger off-white head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the pint with large rings, streaks and chunks of soapy lacing.

Sweet citrus hop aroma thats bursting with uber-fresh dank, floral hops. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit as well as some dank,oily, resinous pine character. Theres a prominent pineapple and mango presence as well as hints of grapefruit, lemon and orange peel. Underneath, theres also a slight pale malt character thats slightly toasty with hints of biscuit and graham cracker.

Fuller bodied than expected with a blast of ridiculously fresh, sweet floral hops that linger into a sweet, dry finish. Slightly earthy with subtle pine and dry bitterness which is complimented by sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Lots of juicy pineapple, mango, grapefruit and orange peel flavor which balances out the drier bitter notes perfectly. Faint toasty malt backbone with hints of biscuit and graham cracker. Just enough of this for complexity and balance without taking away from the glorious hop flavor. The ABV is very well masked with only faint heat toward the end of the swallow, making this beer extremely quaffable.

Overall, this is a delicious and complex beer which is very well balanced and dangerously drinkable. Although its bursting with sweet fruit flavor, its not one-dimensional by any means, with an excellent compliment of dry earthy bitterness, subtle malt and alcohol heat. On par with some of the best west coast IPAs and very similar in flavor profile.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a three-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a fairly clear, copper-amber color that does show a touch of haze (hop-haze one would hope).  The aroma is awesomely dank with hops; an infused mix of bright citrus, pine, tropical fruit and herbaceous dank bud.  The bright tropical fruit character mixes so well with the dank herbal quality that it makes me think of some, as yet undiscovered, cross between a tropical fruit and a really ripe, green marijuana bud.  Specific aromas of tangelo zest, essential citrus oil, big lychee, kumquat, super-concentrated floral peach, some sort of citrusy almost garlic like note, peppery pine sap and a dank menthol note; up front the super ripe, tropical fruit character dominates, while in the finish the herbaceous, even at times peppery, notes come to the fore.  Over time the garlic chive like aromatic note starts to come more to the fore and a spicy, slightly hot note of alcohol also starts to contribute to the nose.

Not as sweet as I was expecting, if it wasnt for the huge tropical fruit component the flavor might even be somewhat dry.  Up front a ripe, tropical fruit note contributes flavors of lychee, kumquat, floral peach nectar and blended tangerine zest juice.  Through the middle the hop notes contribute solid menthol notes, herbal, sometimes rosemary like (though not so distinctly), the flavors one gets by chewing on fresh pine needles and flavors reminiscent, though not overwhelmingly so, of garlic chives.  The bitterness is not overly aggressive here, but it does linger on the palate after the beer has left.  The bitterness is quit clean and crisp in quality; this is a bit surprising given how herbaceous and dank the aroma was, though there is some lingering herbal notes here as well.  The tropical fruit character blends with the herbal notes towards the finish to create a flavor that reminds me a bit of fruity onions or perhaps garlic, this character is fairly slight, but definitely noticeable and not all that objectionable.  This is quite quaffable as the body on this beer is on the light side from your typical Double IPA (many of which are much too cloying); there is enough texture for this to have some palate clinging viscosity, but the herbal and bitter hop notes do a good job of balancing that out.  As the beer warms a bit some hotter, spicier notes of alcohol start to influence the flavor.

I would definitely like to get a fresh off the canning line version of this beer, but this is still quite fresh and vibrantly hoppy.  Given that this is at least a month old at this point, it is lasting pretty well in the can; I would guess that it holds up better than Pliny does in its bottle.  I am not sure that I like this more than fresh Pliny though, it has a bit too much garlic chive flavor and aroma to it (thought thankfully this is held to a low enough level that I am still thoroughly enjoying this beer).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The hops are so sweet/juicy/bitter all at the same time, which I think is what makes this beer so good to me.

4.0 A: Hazy orangish brown color. One and a half fingers of yellowish white head with average retention and spotty lacing.

5.0 S: Excellent! Wonderful bouquet of floral and citrus notes. Orange, tangerine, mango are most dominant. Soft sweetness and a tinge of alcohol beneath the hops.

5.0 T: It tastes as good as it smells and that is saying something. Bitterness is perceived as mild due to the plentiful hop flavors. Loads of citrus again with the fruits mentioned in the nose. Soft sweetness, but the malts are very much overshadowed by the hops. Still, without this subtle sweetness this beer wouldnt be as good. The 9% ABV is hardly detectable. I think the reason I like it so much is because it seems to share a few aspects with NN, which is my favorite brew.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Fairly creamy. I would like just a touch more body.

5.0 D: Really great brew. Surly does nothing but impress me with what they make and this is no exception. Super smooth with a great taste, I could drink this all night. Well done.

Can pored into a strait pint glass produced a nice two finger white head that lasted a while and the trailed of to a great lace. The body had a beautiful apricot colored hue to it. You got some great fresh citrus hops aromas from the glass as you held it to your lips.
The flavor was nicely balanced for a DIPA not a west coast one for sure. The grapefruit bitter was blended with a orange sweetness. It reminded me of a tropical drink and it was quite refreshing. It had a medium feel to it with a ton of carbonation. A great drinking DIPA I would have loved a six pack of this brew but was thankful for the one.

Big thanks to my MN homie, younger35, for the hookup. Poured from 16oz can into my GI pint glass.

A - Pours reddish/gold copper color with a white head. A fingers-wroth of foam disipiates down to a thin cap on top with some bubbles here and there and a thicker ring along the sides of the glass.

S - Big hops, sweet malts, citrus, grapefruit. Everything youd expect from a big DIPA from Surly. 

T - Piney citrus hops with not too much malts. Im so glad this isnt overly sweet. Im so tired of DIPAs that are huge malt-bombs. This one has the huge hops with a nice subtle sweetness on the finish. Nice sweet orange finish with a touch of bitterness.

M - Medium bodied, light carbonation, crisp and refreshing.

D - A very well-done DIPA by Surly. Probably one of the best I can remember in the past few months. I only have a few cans left, but Ill make sure theyre gone before it looses the wonderful hop & malt mix.

T: The sweet tropical fruits are really the main attraction here as well. The pineapple and mango provide a nice sweetness, along with some peaches. There is plenty of juicy grapefruit and pine on the finish to give the beer a great bitterness.

The booze is there, but not in too big of a way.

1182,"2010-04-29",3.3,"16oz can. Slightly greasy, resinous and plastic aroma at first. Oily hop structure when cold gives way to slight fusel and chemical aromas upon warming. Sure... theres a bit of pine resin and citrus meat but malty sweetness and the most bizarre scent of engine oil really take away on the nose for me. Pours bright amber/gold topped by a thin but creamy eggshell white head that leaves spotty lace. Slightly underattenuated malt body gives initial impressions of sweeter sticky caramel and toffee. The greasy hops dont really come into play until near the finish where they coat the back sides of the tongue with a plastic-y resinousness. Medium bodied throughout. Average to low carbonation with a dry, corn-husk-ish finish. Theres really not a whole hell of a lot going on in this beer.

Pours to a nice amber with a perfect white head.  Nose is very strong, and full of citrus and piney hops.  The taste is a medley of hop perfection.  Very fruity, like a succulent mango,  robust with flavor but not as bitter as the name ""Abrasive"" would imply.  I imagine the folks at Surly loaded up the late hop and dry hop additions to achieve this hop-heads dream beer.

Abrasive is a good name for this brew as if you dont like a ton of bitter hops than this one might not be for you. Solid beer but a bit of a disappointment based on past ratings.

Taste is rather sweet and very underwhelming, and it was quite difficult to pull out any distinct qualities in the flavor.  Faintly bitter with some grapefruit pith, but the sweetness really dominated everything else.  Alcohol is never present which is a plus.  Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is restrained.

Theres the usual assortment of citrus flavors on the front end, with well controlled alcohol and a bit of candy sweetness too, but it was really the finish that marked out this beer for me.  It finished with a kind of hop unidimensionality, where it lingers (only moderately bitter) but with an acidic pine flavor that seemed both crass and unwelcome.  The malts here arent doing enough to give this sophistication and subtlety.  I couldnt finish my pour.  I thought in Minnesota we had some chance of avoiding the banal excesses of West Coastism in brewing.  I guess not. (on tap at Muddy Pig, St. Paul)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Pours a lovely fiery amber, well hazed, with touches of orange, a decent offwhitish head that clings to the sides of the glass and laces well. Aromas are powerful: a lovely floral hop bouquet pushing large grapefruit bitterness and zest coupled with orange, moderate tropical fruits of mango, and a sweet balancing malty backbone of carmel and biscuit. Initial has a good body, stepping down a little on harshness, but certainly bringing the taste. Big grapefruity hoppy bitterness coupled with a balancing sweetness. Some tropical fruits lie a little deeper, mango and papaya, florals, and some nice sort of piney resin comes through towards the finish. This doesnt weigh you down, but certainly asserts itself.

Definite sweet malt hits in the middle balancing out the agressive hoppiness. Medium body. Lively and refreshing in the palate.

In long: Nice pungent hoppy nose that is half grapefruits half citrus fruits.  Rather restrained malt backbone with light caramel and residual sugar.  Hops are the stars here with grapefruits, grass, tropical fruits, oranges, citrus fruits.  A little lemony with a light citric touch that makes it even more drinkable.  Relaxed carbonation.  Very bitter but nothing resinous or harsh here, this is a refreshing fruity bitterness.  With a body more rich and a little less sugary sweet this would be a world class IIPA.

The pour is a slight haze orange golden with a well formed one inch light tan head. The head falls slow with thick lacing.  The aroma is fresh resin tropical fruit hops, along with a fruit stripe gum sweetness. The taste has the pineapple fruit up front, along with resin dankness then turns towards more bright sweetness, and a somewhat rough malt character.  The finish is dry leafy grassy hops.  There is also a solid amount of alcohol heat in the back that further dries the finish out. The palate is medium bodied, tiny soft carbonation bubbles, and the dry bitter hop and hot finish. This beer is solidly made, real fresh, and I imagine it is precisely what they intended to brew. However, this is not 100% my thing at the moment.  I used to really enjoy this type of beer.

Huge nose of pine, fresh-cut wood, and some big fruity marijuana. Creamy, thick, sticky body. Nutty, toasty, piney, weedy mid-palate. Long dry finish. Cracing, refreshing, loaded with flavor, and still perfectly harmonious throughout. Lots of DIPAs are just pretending. 16 Grit is the real thing.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1182,"2009-01-10",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2009 Growlers courtesy of Buebie and DBhog shared with 50+ of my closest friends at the Brick Store.  Poured into a tulip.

Pours a slightly hazy orangish amber with a small tan head that showed decent retention and spotty lacing.

Upon opening, the growler threw off one of the most appetizing aromas I have ever smelled.  It was just about every fruit you could imagine in an IPA just streaming out.  Grapefruit was the most prominent aroma but there was oranges, lemons, and other tropical fruits.  There was a bit of caramel malt sweetness in the there as well.

The taste follows the aroma and is almost as spectacular.  Its still all about the fruity hops - grapefruit especially.  The caramel malts balance the taste well and there was a subtle bitterness that took a backseat to the fruits.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied for the style with good carbonation and less abrasive than most DIPAs.

It is quite possibly the most drinkable DIPA I have tasted and one of the better beers I have tried in a while.  Excellent.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
1182,"2009-01-10",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2009 growler from mr. anderson.... pours a semi-murky dark amber brown with a thin quickly dissipating thin soapy white head....hops and malt work in tandem and combine for a balanced nose of tropical fruit and an equal dose of caramel malts..... flavors swayed toward the sweeter side of things with much attention paid to sweet tropical hops and very little bitterness although some citrus rinds peak through in the finish.  malts are there to support the aforementioned hops.  carbonation level more than adequate and good mouthfeel.  i kind of want to say that this reminds me of pliney the younger.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
1182,"2009-01-10",3.9,"Growler that Ty was able to pick this up for me, thanks man.  I pop open the growler and the hoppy aroma just wafts the room.  It pours a thick, dark orange color into a white wine glass, can barely see through it.  The large head fades quickly. Aroma is very sweet, definitely underattenuated, with thick topical fruity hops. It is sweet, thick, and hoppy. Taste follows suit with sweet bubblegum hops.  Its a sweet hop brew with sweet underattenuated sugars.  In this case, this worked for me.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
1182,"2009-01-09",4.2,"Sampled from a growler sent by MatSciGuy - thanks, Levi!!! Ethan thinks hes badass because he called the Amarillo. Whatever, man. But seriously, this is a sick, sick, sick beer. The nose is possibly the most intense Ive encountered for the style, which is saying something. I told myself that I would write a one-word review: DANK. While that captures the beer to some extent, I must rave on. As we head into winter (such as it is in NC), I feel like this beer is springtime personified, with all the rawness, the pungency, the intense freshness. We just smelled it forever, but as floral as the nose is, the taste is amazingly rich, resinous, and bitter. Just what you want from a DIPA. My goodness, Surly, please dont leave this one behind. Outstanding.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
1182,"2009-01-09",4.3,"Huge thanks to JCB for sharing this. We had some biggies last night (Darkness, Charlevoix Vobiscum, etc..) but this one was easily the highlight of the get together.
Pours a soft peachy amber with a one finger creamy light tan head. The nose is extremely pungent, one of the better aromas Ive ever had the privilege  of experiencing. Very fruity and resinous, lots of citrus, sweet malt background, mango, definitely getting the Amarillo here. The flavor is fruity, mango, nice bitterness, sweet, grapefruit rind, very resinous and fresh, piney. I called the Amarillo in this before I even read it had it. Flavor and aroma wreaks of the citrusy Amarillo. Palate has a very nice full body and a mellow bitterness. Amazing.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
1182,"2009-01-09",3.9,"Smelled like concentrated hops and tastes like eating a hop pellet.  Some malt sweetness, which makes it surprisingly well balanced for a beer so loaded with hop bitterness. Thanks to Skyview for sharing this one that I missed from Surly.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1182,"2009-01-09",4.0,"Thanks to Beerlando for procuring this growler! Hazy reddish amber pour with a thick off white head. Pungent spicy grapefruit hop aroma very aggressive. Taste is big, but not as big as the aroma. Nice malt body and big grapefruit, resiny pine with a caramel malt balance. Finishes big and bitter, grapefruit like. I dig this a lot, my type of DIPA.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
1182,"2009-01-09",4.2,"Growler, graciously sent down by DalzAle.  The body is lightly hazy, dark reddish-orange in color.  A frothy, bubbly, cream colored head displays nice retention, leaving sticky, jagged lines and crude spots of lacing on the glass.  Aromas of juicy naval oranges, lemon rind, and grapefruit are as fresh as they come.  Resinous pine and sharp, green grass join the hop party, while sweet toffee and honey malts lend balance.  Tropical mango is faintly detectable as well, lending further depth to the delectable nose.  Flavors follow suit, huge citrus hops and toffee malts crashing into one another, intertwining into a rich and robust concoction.  Very lemony, with a big grapefruit and grass presence, the hoppy bitterness is calmed significantly by the equally massive, sweet, honey-glazed caramel-toffee malts.  Thick and nearly full on the palate, the mouthfeel is heavy but never cloying.  This is just a great brew from Surly.  Im sad to see their growler program going by the wayside, at least for the time being.  If only those Minnesota politicians would taste this brew, they would certainly change the law!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1182,"2009-01-09",4.3,"Sweet baby Jesus, this is good beer. Beautiful aroma... big, sticky, skunky, resiny, but hugely fruity as well. Tropical fruits and honey. Mango, citrus zest, and even perhaps some tart apple?  Great balance of hops and malt and resin/citrus/fruit.

1182,"2009-01-09",4.4,"growler shared with most the orlando crew thanks to Beerlando!  this was quite a treat to try!  Sweet pine, honey malts with resinous pine notes on the nose.  Pours a rish gold with a thin white head.  Sticky pine resin in the flavor, with a good balance of malts, but still hop forward, an awesome ipa.  Citrus rind, grapefruity as it warms with lemon peel and hints of grassy hops.  A real treat and a pleasure to drink.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
1182,"2009-01-08",4.4,"Picked up growler at the brewery and shared with the beer gang at Cellars Wine & Spirits. Pours a hazy orange amber brew, some syrup character that brings a thick off-white head that has some nice retention and lots of lacing. As soon as the growler cap was removed I would pick up  grapefruit scent even before pouring into the glass. Aroma of grapefruit, some mango, tropical fruit and a hint of golden grain malt. Taste is full bodied, a little syrupy, with flavors of grapefruit zest, mango, a touch of banana, and a little pine. Finish is semi-sweet, mildly bitter with a lingering grapefruit and pine aftertaste. Well worth the hour wait in line.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

1182,"2009-01-06",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2010 Growler from faro99, huge thanks Jeff. Rating #8. Dark orange pour with a really nice fluffy off-white head. Very nice hop aroma, grapefruity, slight orange even. More grapefruit in the flavor and a nice hop bite in the end, not bitter at all, very well balanced. Tasty shit.","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
1182,"2009-01-05",3.4,"Growler from Tweety.  Huge thanks for this.  Pours a dark, firey, syrupy bright red color with an off-white head.  Hugely aromatic.  Almost dreadnaught like. Very hoppy, mango and orange, tropical fruit and very, very sweet. A little bit of nail polish remover is also noted.  Flavor is cloying, syrupy, sticky sweet.  Bitterness is low.  Good hop flavor though this is just oozing sweetness.  I prefer a much more dry beer for this style.  This had potential but its just too sweet.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
1182,"2009-01-05",4.3,"Dark amber color, smells great, lots of grapefruit, mango and pine. Very sweet smelling indeed. Taste is a blast of hops followed by a fruity mix that didnt quite overpower the hops. Not near as bitter as Furious, but somewhat balanced. Best smelling IPA I have ever had, and right up there with Hopslam for the top tier of taste.","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","incutrav"
1182,"2009-01-03",4.1,"Poured from a growler. Aroma runs downright musky and rich with sweet perfumed oils, heavy concentrated tangerine and prickly pear juice. Dense. Pours a darker copper and amber, heavily hazed with an off-white rim. Flavor has a very interesting fresh dragonfruit, creamy banana, and heavy wet tropical fruit. Thick and creamy. A peculiar musk rides over this beer in a really nice manner. It balances grasses with heavy tropical fruit. The palate runs a nip sweet. However, there’s a unique, musky tropical grasses, seed, and pit flavor running over this that I assume arises from the high alpha hops. A nice version, kissed with the good edge of Surly house yeast. Nice.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1182,"2009-01-01",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2009 Growler shared with friends.  Pour was a rich dirty orange color with medium carbonation.  Aroma was very fruity, flavor had lots of orange, grapefruit and of course; HOPS!  For being a stronger beer, it hid the alcohol very well.  I hope Surly reconsiders making this a one time only offering, as Im going to be pretty bummed once I run out of Growlers.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
1182,"2008-12-31",4.4,"Growler courtesy of BDR and Tdaglow.  Copper color with a medium head.  Strong tangerine and orange aroma.  Some grassy-ness and lemon.  Far stronger caramel malt flavor than I was expecting.  Not overly bitter tasting at all.  Sweet orange peel.  Delicious.  Great way to end 2008!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
1182,"2008-12-30",3.7,"Growler - also poured courtesy of Omar from the bright tank on the 27th of December and kindly picked up by my wife (I was busy!) A hazy reddish/gold hue, mild carbonation, not too much of a head on it. Sweetness in the nose once you get past the incredible piney and citrus hop aroma. Good caramel malt profile and a balanced, yet bracing bitterness with a mildly sweet finish. You can tell this brew has some punch as it has that nice warm feel to it. I liked it a lot!","Rosemount, Minnesota, USA","timbeer"
1182,"2008-12-27",3.1,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2010 Re-rate on this after I had the can version. The hop profile is quite weak - the beer tastes more like a double malt version of Furious without the super intense mango and citrus character. Taste is really sweet and is like drinking candied apricots. There is a strange plastic character, and lots of oddness going on in the finish. Considering how good Furious is, this one is quite disappointing and dare I say below average.

[Growler] filled directly from the brite tank by Omar. Pours a hazier, slightly darker crimson than the original Furious. The hop profile is extremely similar to that of Furious, lots of mango, grapefruit, pine and citrus, but a touch thicker and there was a lot more malt backbone. Flavor is a lot more malty, and a touch sweeter than its counterpart, but the hops are also significantly more concentrated. This must have been a dangerous beer to brew. If they use too little malt, this monster would have been undrinkable from the crazy amount of bitterness, but it strikes as more balanced, which is honestly a little disappointing.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"
