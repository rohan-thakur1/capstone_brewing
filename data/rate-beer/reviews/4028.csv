This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy semi-burnt orange color with a bar pours kind of slim white head that dissipated evenly and at a nice pace. Light semi-foamy lacing ran around the sides of the glass nicely.
The smell took on some sweet onion and then rolled into the dank sweet to juicy danky grassiness. Slight floral qualities slide in underneath.
The taste was pretty much the same as the smell with a nice danky sweet onion aftertaste running into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly nice sessionable quality about it. Carbonation runs fairly light. Danky juiciness smooths out over my tongue.

The beer is light yellow and mostly clear, exhibiting only a mild haziness. The aroma brings a blast of fresh hops, citrus, tropical fruits. Very nice.

Smooth medium thick body with average carbonation and a long, dry resiny finish. Flavor is a little less citrus-y than the aroma, but still straight Amarillo with a similar base as the other delicious single hop HF beers.

4028,"2012-03-12",3.5,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/14/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL growler into a tulip. 

The pour is a light hazy straw yellow color with a nice creamy froth. The head retains well for a growler fill and leaves a bit of lace. 

A pale malt base, with tons of amarillo in the nose, which is no shock. Some grapefruit focused citrus, a good dank presence, and some pine hop aroma are present as well.  

The flavor is very pleasantly bitter. There is not much sweet malt, mostly just an unadulterated bitterness. Grapefruit, orange zest, spicy pine, and some herbal hops contribute to a predictably amarillo hop bill. The finish is fairly clean.

I am surprised by how light of a body this has, to the point that it kind of detracts from the overall experience. Otherwise, the beer is smooth, creamy, and properly carbonated. Slightly grainy, with a good amount of hop residue. 

I like amarillo hops, and there is a nice foundation to this beer. It does not reach quite the level that I was anticipating going in, but it was pretty good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

T - Starts off with lots of pungent hops slowly giving way to a mix of citric fruits, light sweetness, and sticky pine resin. The finish is even more hop bitterness, lingering for a short period of time. The combination of juicy flavors and low ABV. makes this one extremely drinkable.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Crisp, bitter, feel lingering on the pallet for some time.

4028,"2011-10-08",3.8,"On draft.  Nice golden amberish color with a great white head.  The Amarillo hops come through nice.  Refreshing but complex.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","hbmason"
4028,"2011-10-03",3.9,"On draft at the brewery.  This one was very cool.  Ive never had a beer that accented amarillo before.  A nice grassy/piney hop that has some light citrus flavors.  Very tasty and extremely drinkable pale.  Wish I had tried it before the other 15 or so beers.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
4028,"2011-10-02",4.0,"From growler, courtesy of Peter & Yolanda. Tremendous fresh hop aroma, floral and grassy with tons of nuances. Light sweet malt but mainly hops! Pale hazy-cloudy yellowish, with thin white head. Medium body with medium carbonation. Starts with light to medium pale malt sweetness, some orange blossom, light carbonic acidity. Tons of fresh hop flavor in this one. Light bitter finish and after - big hop flavor but not overly bitter or harsh. A real treat.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

4028,"2011-10-01",4.1,"Phone rate. Draught at Reservoir in Waterbury. Slightly hazy golden with a 2 1/2 finger white, good retention in the HF globe. Citrus nose with some backing pine, some light tropical mango and biscuit malt behind. Flavor is more tropical as well as adding substantial bitterness, peaking at a 6-7. Low to medium carbonation with a light body. Much drier than the Edward and less caramel and malt noted. More IPAish to me, and another winner from HF.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
4028,"2011-10-01",3.8,"Draught at TND:  Aroma of hops, citrus, pineapple, Amarillos, lemon, lime, fresh picked hop cones, and some tropical fruit.  Poured yellow/gold in color with a tiny, white head that lasted throughout.  Very hazy.  Slightly sparkling.  Ok lacing.  Flavor is heavily bitter.  Tastes of hops, grass, light pineapple, evergreen, hop oil, Amarillo, citrus, pine, lemon, lime, and a hint of malt.  Medium body.  Very dry texture.  Average to lively carbonation.  Heavily bitter, hop, pine, pineapple, grass, hop oil, lemon finish is very dry.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
4028,"2011-09-25",4.3,"One of the better IPAs around. Had it on tap at Hawthornes in Philly. Dont go because Id like to get some more. Pours a light amber with a small head. The aroma is loaded with sweet malt, pine and citrus. The flavor starts sweet and then here comes the hops. Very dry and clean. Fantastic.","Sicklerville, New Jersey, USA","keepersj12"

4028,"2011-09-16",4.4,"Big thanks to aapp for sending out a 750mL growler of this, and as well to imagineiii for sending one for us to share down here. Served in a tulip.

Pours a nice yellow-golden with a two-finger white head with pretty good retention and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose explodes with super-fresh Amarillo hops. Loads of floral character and a bit of citrus. A bit catty as well. Great amount of hops. The flavor doesnt explode quite as well and its not the pure Amarillo that the nose was, but still quite tasty. Light-medium body with crisp carbonation and an exceptionally-smooth bitterness. Phenomenal.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
