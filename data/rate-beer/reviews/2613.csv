2613,"2017-06-22",2.9,"Botella en 99Cervezas.

Vierte en amarillo pajizo, bastante transparente, con muy abundante formación de espuma blanca de burbuja media, buena persistencia y notable adherencia.

De intensidad media en nariz, da notas de pan fresco, malta y plátano, acompañadas de un punto cítrico.

De entre los sabores básicos destaca el dulce y el salado, así como un amargo muy suave que redondea el conjunto. En el postgusto sale de nuevo el plátano, aunque de forma más bien suave y el punto a limón. Poca complejidad.

De cuerpo medio-ligero y textura algo untuosa, es de carácter más bien refrescante. Conforme los tragos se acumulan en boca el dulce gana importancia dando la sensación de formarse una capa que se mantiene hasta el final de la cerveza, lo que le resta algo de bebestibilidad.

Una cerveza agradable, aunque se echa de menos la sensación en boca de una hefeweizen no filtrada. Está buena, pero puestos a repetir antes elegiría casi cualquier otra de sus excelentes hermanas en Schneider Weisse.","Valencia, SPAIN","JuanCC"

2613,"2017-02-07",3.6,"Data ważności:  31.03.2017 
 Kolor:  Słomkowy. Piwo jest w 100% klarowne. Jak na pszenicę, jest to bardzo ciekawy widok ;) 
 Piana:  Wysoka, bujna, czapowata. Biała masa drobnoziarnistego puchu, którą można zjadać łyżkami jak bita śmietanę.
Piana stoi w miejscu przez bardzo długo czas i nie opada w dół nawet na milimetr.
Po paru minutach redukuje się do wypasionego okręgu. Pozostawia na ściankach bogaty lacing. 
W skali RateBeer 5/5! 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest wybitnie pszeniczny. Od razu wiemy z jakim piwem mamy tutaj do czynienia. Nie ma tutaj żadnej ściemy. Solidna nuta estrowa podparta wysoką fenolową przyprawowością.
Nie brakuje skojarzeń z gumą balonową, dojrzałym bananem i lekkim cytrusowym kwaskiem w tle. 
Goździk na pierwszym planie, jeśli chodzi o przyprawy. Mocno i stylowo. 
I o to właśnie chodzi! 
 Smak:  W smaku sporo słody pszenicznego.
Konkretnie wyczuwalne są akcenty banana, lekka guma balonowa.
W drugim szeregu odrobina przyprawowych fenoli. Pieprz dodaje pikantności na ostatniej prostej. Wspierają go sugestie goździków.
Ponownie lekkie cytrynowe detale majaczą gdzieś w oddali. 
Goryczka jest niewielka, sam finisz kwaskowaty.
Pełnia umiarkowana.
Wysokie wysycenie i spora pijalność. 
 Wysycenie:  Wysokie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

W ramach uzupełniania stylów na RateBeer degustuje piwo w nowym, jak dla mnie dotąd nieznanym stylu - German Kristallweizen.
Klasyczne piwa pszeniczne tzw. ""mit heffe"" (m.in. Hefeweizeny) są nieprzejrzyste, mętne za względu na osad drożdżowy.
Wersja Kristall jest natomiast filtrowana i całkowicie klarowna.
Oba style mają natomiast ten sam estrowo-fenolowy profil.
Sporo tutaj odnośników w stronę dojrzałych bananów, gumy balonowej, lekkich cytrusów wzmocnionych o przyprawowe nuty goździka i pieprzu.
Piwo można pić litrami. Jest lekkie w odbiorze, mocno pijalne. 
Nie jest to jakiś sztos, ale w letni dzień z pewnością sprawdzi się idealnie.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Taste: Close to light sweet malt, with strong metallic, light banana, caramel, moderate wheaty tartness, phenolic, spices, yeast, moderate lemon, moderate to light bitter hops and quite strong grass. 

Body: Close to medium body. Slick and creamy palate.

This was poured into a weizen glass. 
The appearance had the normal cloudy orange to slight brown color. Theres a slight transparency trying to come in as I do see some light bubbles around the edges rising at a good pace. The head was thick and soft full of at least a good three finger white foaminess that gently died at a nice pace. 
The smell was slightly bready/yeasty. Slight clove to coriander spice that entered in with the normal ""banana"" light esters to enter and fulfill its commission of the kristallweizens of kristallweizens. 
The taste was mainly sweet and carried a fairly nice spice to conjure up a fulfilling Summers night.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. Hot damn, this was really good. The carbonation was there but nowhere to be seen to be overbearing. Oh, how smooth she runs over my mouth.

2613,"2006-10-12",2.7,"Not the best of Kristalls, not denying it filled a spot in between here and the next beer. Im starting to wonder about the beers of this Brauerei, not really living up to the earnt hype of years before, has brewing changed recently!?!
Poured into its own tall weiss glass. Bright, dull, pale gold with a huge flurry of carbonation releasing out to an immense, rocky white crown (grew an inch out the glass) that held in place needing a good chomp to bite it off. Lace work was meticulous as it ebbed down the glass. Aroma was almost distant with faint bubblegum and summer grains being the only things I could detect. Nothing else. Zingy lemons in the mouth as it whips furiously across the palate. There is a nice touch of summer grains here, wheaty but subtle. Very light bodied, like mineral water, and a little too fizzy even of style. Touch of white bread mid-palate, light sour malt shows late before a clean, crisp finish with just a little wheat malt lingering briefly. This didnt offer much, weissbier relies on a balance of spicy phenolics and sweet/sour fruit esters. Where were they..., on a break, maybe a holiday!?!. This was wonderfully refreshing (like spritzig wasser), subtle, in fact almost lifeless, but easy to drink none-the-less. But it just wasnt a Weizenbier.

2613,"2006-06-13",2.9,"50 cl bottle. No yeast at the bottom. Golden clear colour with a huge white head. Light aroma of yeast an bread. Refreshing flavour of wheat combined with fruitness and yeast. Very light and easy to drink.","Amager, DENMARK","Storm"
2613,"2006-04-30",2.5,"Pours clear with a white head and excelent lacing. Aroma showed some slight banana, a little stale.  The body seems to be much the same, similar to an unfilterd wheatbeer but less, and a little sour and grainy. So much character has been taken out that it heads in the direction of pale lagers. The finish is bland, like the aroma,  body, and for that matter.. style.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","voota"
2613,"2006-01-16",3.3,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2007 Poured clear (of course) golden orange, with a pillowy white head that tend to last. Slightly metallic aroma of creamy banana and some light cloves notes. There was also a little bit of alcohol and weak bugglegum. The flavour was a bit bland, with some shallow bitterness, but enough to have you searching for the next gulp. The palate was indeed metallic, and a little too thin, although the carbonation was at a pleasant level. This beer starts off well, by looking and smelling great, but fell away a bit when it hit the mouth. Anyway, its not too shabby.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"

2613,"2005-08-24",4.3,"For a kristal, this brew is quite good. Crisp and light on the tongue, bracing yet never intrusive. The fruit and cloves rescue it from being boring, while not demanding too much from the drinker. A good pub brew.","Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA","shendrix"

Ok, I´m not so in Kristallweizen, but this one is quite disappointing, at least compared to its bigger brothers/sisters from Schneider.","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
2613,"2005-04-09",3.5,"Bottle. This one surprised me. I was expecting it to be inferior in all ways to the hefe version. Significantly lighter than the hefe version, crystal clear light gold with plenty of efferescence as expected, and a big white head that I had trouble controlling on the pour. Aroma was true to style, very much like its hefe brother. I was expecting a somewhat muted taste, but was very surprised as it was full of flavour, cleaner but less complex than the ""mit hefe"". Felt a bit lighter in the mouth, but I guess that is to be expected. Very nice Krystal! Would be a good way to introduce the style to those unable to cope with cloudiness. I really need to try this one again alongside its hefe brother.","Brisbane beer desert, AUSTRALIA","hefevice"
2613,"2005-03-30",3.0,"Light, spritzy kristalweizen. Fair summer drinking but a long way from the brewers best work. Poured a pale gold colour with a lasting head. The aroma has honey and wheat notes, plus a dash of spice. Very light on its toes and clean-tasting. Not enough body for my taste but its in style. Highly carbonated - quite champagne-like.

2613,"2005-01-12",3.5,"Bottle (dated 11/09/04 - I suspect this is the bottling date): This was a good looking beer from the start. Clear gold with a fine bead and a big white head that formed a peak above the rim of the glass. A sweet, spicey aroma lifted from the glass immediately. Upon closer inspection some malty vanilla and lemony notes came to attention. The flavour was more restrained but perhaps a little more complex - fruity (sweet lemon) with a slight initial hop flavour that grew to a mellow garnish on a very simple but satisfying wheaty malt base. Silky in the mouth with a very fine level of carbonation and refreshing yet low bitterness. I really liked this.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Aarleks"
2613,"2005-01-08",1.9,"Pours a big fizzy head, looks almost icy.  Varietal nose with touches of larger traits but a bit subdued.

Fairly non-descript palate, seems a bit flat in the flavour department, giving nothing away.  Faint orange peel notes at best.  Disappointing.

Big head which hangs around for ever. Very clear and pale. No cloudiness at all.

Light carbonation on the tongue. Slight bitterness. I am wondering what chucking a bit of lemon into this would do? Maybe I try that next time when I have some lemon lying around.

Nice enough, but nothing memorable. I keep thinking that a kristall ought to be a brilliant summer afternoon beer but they never seem to deliver. Maybe I have it all wrong.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","SimonLarsen"

Has a nice sweet maltiness but not the juicy maltiness that makes some other Weizens so good. Very slight bitterness which I could have done without.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"
