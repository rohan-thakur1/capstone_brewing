3162,"2017-06-01",3.9,"Fruited sour beers made with blueberries are really hard to pull off, in my experience, because the flavor from the berries gets stripped away in the fermentation. Theyve done as much as they can with it, here, but, while the berries add a bit of tannins and complexity, not much bluberry flavor gets through. Still, its a good effort, with a lot of tartness and oak tannin coming through.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

Sweet juicy blueberries, big dry blueberry skin, big funky tartness from the base fermier, white wine, hay, citrus notes. Taste follows with a big blueberry bang, they must have used a redicilous amount of it. Dry oak fermier tartness, wine, dry funk tartness, amazing bodied mouthfeel. Lovely fruited Saison.

3162,"2016-08-15",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2017 Bottle pour at FoFA. Hazy purple with a small white head, low retention, leaving little lacing. Aroma is of blueberries flesh, some funk, cheesy notes, mild oak spiciness and mineral notes. Taste is moderately acidic with blueberry flesh (loads of), lactic notes, oak, oak spiciness, winey notes and lemon. Medium-light body. Medium carbonation. Winey mouthfeel. Acidic but not puckering finish with lemon and blueberry flesh. Very good blueberry sour with a nice balance between fruits and acidity. Not the most complex one but the winey presence definitely add a fun character. 
 
I had it again, thanks to Didier, at a lambic tasting and it was one of the more unidimensional beer of the night. Pretty acidic and not much depth. Dont age this one.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3162,"2016-08-09",4.7,"Shared at an Ann Arbor get together at Jeffs on July 20. 750 mL bottle, blend 1. The pour is a bright ruby/purple color with a thick dark pink head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is fantastic. There is a great tart blueberry skin and a bright flesh. A light lemon sourness is present and a hint of oak to it. This is tart and crisp and lovely. The flavor is great. There is a light funk and a ton of blueberry skins and flesh. Its tart and juicy with a resounding sourness. This is one of the best blueberry sours Ive ever had Maybe the best. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly sour blueberry skin that lingers forever. This is a spectacular beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3162,"2016-07-18",4.1,"750 mL bottle. Bright pink/purple body with a small white head. Smells of blueberry and white wine. Lightly acidic. Tastes lemony and tart. Blueberry takes over and dries it out. Oak and white wine kicks in. Lingering lemony tartness. Medium light body. Low carbonation. Nuanced and not too sour. Great blueberry flavor.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3162,"2016-07-18",4.4,"Bottle. Garnet pour with a white head. Sour blueberry aromas. So tasty. Mild sour blueberries, sort of, if that makes sense. This is really good. Its sour but not overly so. Its blueberry but more berry if you feel me. Really good mouthfeel with a good body. A real stunner.","Florida, USA","50belair"
3162,"2016-07-12",4.3,"750 ml bottle via STL trade. Pours a semi-cloudy ruby color with a small head that dissipates into a tiny ring. Abundant blueberry character, with nice tartness, lemon juice, oak. Just really big blueberry. Light-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a fruity, acidic mouthfeel. Seems like anything with ""Fermier"" from Side Project is pretty much bulletproof.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3162,"2016-07-11",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2016 750 ml bottle to snifter (shared with Ferris and jtclockwork). Looks good; a slightly hazy blueberry flesh with white head that has a very light pink hue to it and steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells awesome! Loads of blueberry alongside notes of oak and funk. Some tartness as well. Tastes like it smells, but not quite as robust. Still delicious though. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and pleasantly tart. Delicious.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

3162,"2016-07-04",4.0,"Sample at Boulevardia 2016. Comes a pale red with a small pinkish head. Aroma of citrus, funk, and wood. Taste is citrus, berries, funk, and oak. Very nice tartness. Very enjoyable.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
3162,"2016-04-16",4.0,"750 B1. Color is reddish pink that showed up an almost neon fuchsia in picture with the flash. Aroma is mild funk, lemon sour. Taste is light sour, yogurt, blueberry smoothie. Flavors are subtle with great balance. Very palatable. Reminds me more of something from the fruited Hill Farmstead Flora series than the Fermier series. Good now, but based on my previous experience with SP and my own preferance for the more warhead strength sour, I would imagine a few months of bottle conditioning would really help this.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
3162,"2016-04-14",4.4,"Bottle shared by Cory. Pours a cloudy purple with small off white and pinkish head that lasts. The aroma is strong berry, funk, oak. Thin mouth, nice berry, oak, light funk, nice tartness, really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
