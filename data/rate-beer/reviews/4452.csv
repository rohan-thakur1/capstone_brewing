4452,"2017-05-05",3.6,"Can, best before 6.28.17, drunk 3/28/17.Pretty awesome neon-violet-ruby-pink body seems lightly hazy with a violet-pink-tinged off-white head that shows moderate retention for the style (rating it as sour/wild). Lots of blueberry sediment left on the bottom.Very bright, poignant blueberry notes mix with a good deal of oak while moderate Brett adds a more gentle fruitiness and tartness to the mix. Lots of blueberry skin/tannin adding a more deep pepper-like spiciness and light vegetal character that does help balance the more intense acidity. Malt is very light with dry wheat-like character showing through lightly but little/no sweetness. No alcohol or flaw.In the mouth its intensely acidic though softened by the wheat/malt and blueberry skin tannin. They definitely did not skimp on the blueberry and it shows coming through in every possible way here. To that end, its a bit dominated by the blueberry, though I still find it very enjoyable as blueberry is a very mild but flavorful fruit. Vanilla, oak, soft woody character and lots of spice on the finish with low but engaging carbonation and no alcohol or flaw. A weird one, and somewhat lacking on the beer aspect, but I respect the obvious care that went in to it and I love how raw and real the blueberry is.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4452,"2017-04-28",4.0,"Accidental can purchase from K&L in Redwood City, CA (didnt realize this cost $13 until I had already paid). Pour is vibrant purple with a thick foam of dusty magenta. Aroma is funk, fossilized blueberries, cloven hooves, petrified beasts. Taste is tart, sour funk, spicy funk, vinegar, wine, tannic, grape peels, very mild undercurrent of blueberries. Perhaps it was the bright can or the other reviews seeming to downplay the funk, but this is way more funk than expected. Maybe even the funkiest funked out beer Ive had which isnt bad, just was expecting more fruit depth. Still an incredibly funky beer...probably not worth the entry fee though.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"

4452,"2017-02-02",4.0,"From notes. Had at a tasting with the group at Eriks house on January 22. 330 mL can. The pour is a dark, dark purple with a thick ring of dark pink head that vanishes slowly with a couple spots of lace left behind. Damn this looks good. The aroma is really sweet and fruity. There is a ton of blueberry skin and flesh, melding together well with the malts and a lot of lactic acid. There isnt an overdone acidity, but its really well balanced. I wish the fruit popped more. The flavor is much of the same. There is a little more sharpness to the fruits in the flavor, but Im not sure if its the fruits, the acid, the tartness, or all of the above. There is a pretty hefty funk on the back end to let you know youre not getting off too easily. The mouth feel is thicker and heavy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly funky, yet tart blueberry.

Flavour is heavy concentration of blueberry again, as expected, rather tart, a bit vinous with a hint of sweet fruit, a touch of the tannic fruit skin and oak notes, soft vanilla towards the back, and a little Brett on the finish and aftertaste to remind you its still lambic. Medium-full grippy body with rather spritzy carb and very little hint of the alcohol.
