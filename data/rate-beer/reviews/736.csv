736,"2017-06-05",2.9,"Bottle from Cromarty brewery. Pours hazy reddish amber with a small cream head. Aroma is dank hops and some malt and odd yeast esters. Flavour is strangely resinous, spicy with some toffee. Taste is quite bitter and astringent. Not enough sweetness to balance the hops. Mouthfeel is quite thin and watery.

Taste of rye, caramel, some spice, slight resin, a little red fruit and subtle grassy hops. Medium bodied and soft carbonation. A dryish, spicy rye bitterness in the finish. A red ale focusing on the spicy rye which I like. Would prefer a little bit more hop bite but still good.","Stoke On Trent, Staffordshire, ENGLAND","Towey1989"

A rather dull chestnut colour at first glance with a loose cream head, but when the sunlight hits the glass (as it did in the beer garden this evening) a bright reddish copper gleam appears; the aroma is full of red fruit with a hint of rye; the taste is fruity with a caramel sweetness at first, then becoming drier with a gentle bitterness and some woody resin towards the finish.

Medium body, not bubbly yet fairly spritzy, good intensity, medium acidity, dry, peppery tingle lasts a good long time. Dark flavours on the palate: smoky, dates, black pepper with cinnamon swirls; Theres a hint of sweeter spice and woody elements, rye bread kicks in mid-palate; Bittering hops come in right at the finish with a purge of wet grass and over-ripe grapefruit.

Good stuff again from Cromarty & much improved on their Happy Chappy that I had last from them. Hoppy (although the nose could have used more) with nice citrus & pine flavours balanced well against the caramel and biscuit malt sweetness that gave the beer a similar flavour to that of an American pale ale in places.

Equally comforting initial taste under the canopy, sprigs of sweated raisin before hugs of sweet grain on the palate fall through a hoppy floor. A Rye reminder creeps into a spring of a finish, like the bit after the credits in Hollyoaks, edging you back for more. Surprisingly excellent on keg - would be keen to retry the bottle in comparison.
