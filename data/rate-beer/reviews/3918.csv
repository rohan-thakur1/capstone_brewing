3918,"2016-07-17",3.9,"Poured a light golden yellow color with aromas of tart lemons, light vanilla, marshmallows and some light hay. Flavors are lemon pie with light vanilla, light tartness, could drink this stuff for days and not get tired.","Florida, USA","burg326"
3918,"2016-06-19",4.5,"Funky Buddha Lemon Meringue Berliner Weisse is a dessert in a glass. Pours a hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Aroma is just like lemon meringue -- lemony and sweet. Taste is more of the that lemon meringue. Not a lot of complexity, but it sure is tasty. Lemon Meringue makes for a refreshing summer drink. Close you eyes and taste the fluffy dessert!","Orlando, Florida, USA","sloshgator"
3918,"2016-06-07",3.5,"Draft. Pours yellow with white head. Aroma is lemon. Taste is lemon forward, and does mimic lemon meringue pie. Missing the berliner tarntess, otherwise this would be great. Now its good.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","beechner224"

3918,"2013-02-27",3.6,"A hazed blonde weisse with no head. In aroma, spot on weisse with lemon meringue, creamy character, lime juice, quite nice. In mouth, a classic lemon juice with a touch of vanilla, coconut notes, very nice. On tap at brewpub, Feb. 13 2013.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
3918,"2013-02-10",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Citrus zest and juice explode atop and within this sour brews lactic and citric acidity, creating a quenching, flat wheat lemonade.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-There is no foam to speak of atop this milky beige-looking yellow. This is rather ugly, but I cant give the lowest score since part of it (the lack of head) is intentional.
-A mineral touch appears after the citrusy acidity.
-This may be linear, but it is refreshing.
-If you dont like lemon, run away from this one.
-Carbonation is about 5 volumes lower than what a Berliner Weisse should be, so I dont really agree with the Berliner Weisse moniker... And the added citrus zest, and fruity intensity are way off the charts as well Nonetheless, this is a highly pleasant fruited sour ale, and thats what matters most.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
3918,"2012-10-05",4.1,"Leftovers from Funky Buddhas 2 year anniversary. Glad to see this one up on the chalk board

A: Pours a murky gold color. No head

S: As close to lemon meringue as possible. Tons and tons of sweet and sour lemon, notes of whipped cream, and even a little graham cracker. Definitely gonna be tart

T: See above and add some super sourness. Not quite as delicious as passion fruit but a delicious novelty beer for sure. Definitely a refreshing change of pace from your everyday Berliner

MF/O: Smooth carbonation, easy drinking and low ABV. Finish is sour lemon.","Parkland, Florida, Florida, USA","scottyshades"
3918,"2012-08-31",4.1,"On tap at Funky Buddha. Pours murky golden orange with small white head. Aromas lemon, fresh fruit, and some sweet and tartness. It honestly has a fresh ginger quality to it. Flavors of lemon, vanilla, cream, and nice amount of tartness. Extremely drinkable and full of lip smacking goodness.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"
3918,"2011-12-07",4.8,"Draft This beer rocks! Murky straw-colored ale with a small, fizzy, white head that dissipates in a flash. The aroma is a citric swirl of lemon meringue and Lemonheads candy with a whisper of key lime and a dash of vanilla. Light to medium-bodied with a mildly creamy mouthfeel and tickling carbonation. The flavor is flat-out sour and uber delicious  Lemonheads and vanilla stand out. Finishes very puckering with kisses of lemon and vanilla. Totally world class Berliner Weisse!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3918,"2011-11-27",4.2,"On draft at the Buddha. UF vs. FSU game day. I left my buds house at half time to clear my thoughts and to try and process the utter disgrace that was the Florida Gators. Thankfully this was still on draft and I quickly ordered it without hesitation. The aroma is full of lemon and tartness. Flavor is a mix between sour lemon and vanilla cream. A pure delight to drink.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
