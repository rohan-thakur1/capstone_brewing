3239,"2017-01-01",5.0,"2016 est mort...vive 2017! Je souhaite à tous les amateurs de bière une excellente année houblonnée et espère que ceux qui ne sont pas encore amateurs le deviendront en 2017 et viendront agrandir la tribu des ratebeeriens. Et quoi de mieux pour fêter la nouvelle année que de débuter par la brasserie Dupont ""Avec les Bons Voeux"" qui pour ceux qui ne le savent pas encore étaient une bière traditionnellement offerte en début dannée par la brasserie pour remercier leurs bons clients. Bon client je le suis assurément. Cest dailleurs un de mes premiers coup de cur brassicole qui après des années passées dans le côté obscur du vin, me montra le bon côté de la force. Mais ressentir la force nest rien si guidé par un maître Jedi vous nêtes pas. Et 2016 fut pour moi riche dune grande rencontre, brassicole tout dabord et qui me permet actuellement dapprofondir cet art, mais avant tout une rencontre humaine, car cest la force de la bière que de pouvoir faire naître des amitiés. Mais revenons à nos Bons Vux. Quoi de mieux pour débuter lannée de façon enlevée pour une année Rockn Roll. Car cette bière est Rockn Roll : racée, puissante avec ce brin dexcentricité qui font les grands groupes ou musiciens. En verre, on sent lhabit des grands : costume blond doré taillé pour la scène. De lénergie à revendre avec une forte effervescence, une multitude de petites bulles et la grande classe avec sa mousse blanche de deux centimètres dépaisseur. Dans les gradins, lambiance se fait déjà ressentir...électrique...dans latmosphère on peut déjà ressentir à la fois de la puissance avec lalcool mais également de la classe avec des arômes floraux, dagrumes sur un fond de céréales et candi. Que le concert commence! avec une introduction basse et clavier : une attaque sur une une mélodie légèrement suave parée de céréales, dagrumes et candi. Entrent alors en scène guitare et batterie pour enlever tout cela et donner de la puissance à notre composition : lamertume et lalcool vont crescendo, lenvolée est exceptionnelle, avec un vibrato de nuances époustouflant. Les basses et le clavier toujours présents, marquent tout juste leur présence pour une arrière bouche sur des notes de céréales et de candi afin daccompagner lensemble. Léquilibre est parfait, et tel un solo dun grand guitariste, les variations sont sans limites, mais toujours dans le respect de la mélodie et du rythme. Le final finira par un riff sur les épices et les fruits confits terminant en beauté le concert....Le 5 nest pas même suffisant. 500?! Cela me paraît plus raisonnable, surtout pour ma 100 ème bière belge. Je pourrai vous recommander de la déguster sur une cassolette de fruits de mer, mais jai plutôt envie de vous conseiller de la déguster en écoutant les Kaiser Chiefs, et surtout de la déguster entre amis. De mon côté je la dégusta avec un grand ami belge, présent par lesprit. Avec mes bons voeux!","FRANCE","jybi"

3239,"2016-03-04",3.9,"750ml bottle. 8/12/14 bottle date. Appearance: Light copper and slightly hazy, with a thick white head that lingers with nice lacing. 
Aroma: Earthy, grassy, peppery, citrus rind, and a white vinous character. Prototypical saison yeast characteristics with some bready malt undertones. 
Taste: High malt sweetness with clove and pear. Just a hint of spice and a moderate bitterness. Taste profile is very much like a tripel. 
Mouthfeel: Light/medium body with high carbonation and some alcohol warmth. 
Finish: Frutiness (pear) remains with some light breadiness. 
Overall: Feels like Im drinking two different beers. The aroma is very much a saison, with spicy, peppery, earthy notes. When you taste the beer a lot of those characteristics disappear and a tripel emerges, with pear and clove 
prominent. Doesnt have the typical pepper and dryness of a saison. Overall a very good beer.....whatever it is","","TH28"

Picked up this Winter Seasonal Belgian Tripel last winter in Rome but it is widely available in Japan at all fine retailers with a better than average belgian beer selection.

Pouring a dense orange-honey hold with a big aroma: tart, fruits(peach & pear), white pepper and a rich wine like character. 

Fairly full bodied, it has a raspy round carbonation but finished very dry.



The taste is plums, stone fruits, nuts (maybe almonds?) & some spiciness. Remarkably light flavor for a 9.5% beer. You don't taste it but you definitely get that warmth radiating from your happy stomach. Really nice stuff.

Aroma has a core of lightly sweet malt with a bunch of wheat character and a little fruitiness, coriander, wet grass, citrus peels, peppery/lemongrass sort of hop/phenolic mix. Palate is light to moderate sweet to start with a touch of caramel, orange, peach, wheat, transitioning into a more dry and bitter middle with coriander, dry grass, citrus peels, fairly aggressive spicy phenolics. Phenolic, herbal bite lingers into the finish, which has a bit of bread/biscuit and dustier yeast notes as well, some hop bitterness, alcohol heat, and grass in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with high effervescent champagne-style carbonation. A good phenolic rather than estery tripel with a hop bite, but also too much alcohol present, even after a years ageing.

Linger is the first real hit of booze, dusky vanilla and scraped banana peel with a brassy tang.

Espumota blanca densa y con brillo de buena formación y buena retención, q deja esos puntitos blancos de lavadura y poso en el fondo. Es una cerveza compleja. Aromas donde predominan los frutales, manzana verde, dulces y a levadura...algo cítrico, embriaga,...tb se nota el alcohol, herbal. En boca es bastante cremosa y con carbonatacion viva. Los sabores muy equilibrados entre el dulce y el amargo... se nota la malta, el lúpulo y la levadura. Frutal, dulce, refrescante y algo alcohólica, en un principio para pasar a un amargor medio herbal y terminar con cierta astringencia donde la levadura aparece junto con los lúpulos q venían de antes y el alcohol q calienta la garganta. Sin duda para tenerla en casa siempre jajaja. Birrote. Cerveza compleja, fácil de beber y q puede gustar a mucha gente.

3239,"2015-02-21",4.0,"When I first encountered this beer, from tap somewhere in a beer pub in Ghent, it was still a seasonal rarity, but it became so succesful that nowadays it is easily available throughout Belgium and beyond the whole year; it has gained a wide following too, making it far from evident to rate it objectively... I bought a 75 cl bottle for this rating, but unfortunately the drinks center hasnt kept it in optimal circumstances. Anyway: hazy, deep golden blonde beer with a mist of small yeast bits, under a very sticky and lacing, dense, snow white head, hops-enhanced and remaining remarkably stable in relation to the ABV, a feature often seen in the Dupont saison family. The aroma is unfortunately suffering from the dreaded lightstruck effect (ammonia-like stench from hops degeneration under the influence of light) at first, but I have Lady Luck on my side today, as it vanishes after the second pour from the bottle. I otherwise get rural hints of apple peel, Poire William, horse, wet hay, unripe peach, freshly cut grass, old cheese, jenever, dust, white pepper, lime, soap, prosecco. Taste begins with a vivid yet dryish fruitiness (apple, redcurrant, green plum) accompanied by a residual white candi sugar sweetishness, sharp citrussy fraîcheur and a strong, sourish, minerally carbonation - the palate is immediately awakened. Then a bready, honeyish, full pale malt sweetness follows, with a tingling spicy, almost wild and somewhat funky yeastiness on top of it; the sourishness paired with the strong fizz have a drying, brut effect on the mouth cavity, but still leaving room for a noble, fruity sweetness. More minerals, yeastiness and lingering pale malts in the finish, where a grassy, herbal and earthy hop bitterness takes over, along with warming jenever-like alcohol, resulting in a long, dry, appetizing ending in which bitter and sweet are in perfect harmony, as in most good tripel beers. This is undoubtedly a great apéritif and the perfect missing link between saison and tripel - as which Dupont intended it back in the seventies. Too bad for the lightstruck effect due to below optimal storage conditions in this particular bottle, but I had this beer dozens of times and I wont take it into account for this rating. Differs a bit from batch to batch, like many of the classic artisanal Belgian saisons; this sample is quite sweet and fruity, others tend to be more bittering and sourish - making this beer all the more interesting. Has great ageing potential too but I havent yet had the patience to mature a couple of bottles in the cellar for more than a year. This has justly become a classic in the Belgian beer landscape, as Moinettes big brother. Still love it, like most of Duponts beers and certainly all of their saison style beers. Always a pleasure to revisit this one - and Ive been as objective as I could...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Meget smuk gylden honningfarvet Triple med kraftig eftergæring på flasken, som både lægger sig i glasset som små fiskeæg, hvor andre ""danser"" rundt og lever sit eget liv - et fantastisk syn. Stor offwhite-farvet skumkrone på 4-5 cm, som danner et flot skumlandskab. 
Aromaen er knap så tydelig, men noter af den frigivne gær er til stede. En anelse frugt fornemmes ligeså.
Smagen er sødlig, bitter og moderat krydret. Meget overvældende. Man bydes først på lidt diskret sødme, som senere ledsages af lidt bitterhed, og dernæst træder krydderierne ind og lægger en dyne over det hele. Dette ledsages af en fint perlende kuldioxid, som kæler for ganen mens brygget nydes. Et indhold på knap under medium. 
Lang god eftersmag med masser af krydderier.

Taste reveals an unbelievable smooth mouthfeel, due to a huge amount of Belgian yeast, which puts a pillow on the palate. On top of that, warm stingy spices amongst black pepper build up a fascinating complexity, which results in a medium dry finish, with subtle vanilla notes. Very easy to drink, alcohol is present at no point at all, very intriguing, well balanced beer. Bretts among metallic, lively carbonation are responsible for a supporting sour- and dryness, which underlines the slick. spicy yeast impression just perfect. As I am drinking a young bottle, bretts are recognizable only for a short period of time, mingled together with copper flavor. When those leave the palate, dough malts and supersmooth mouthfeel do become even more present.","GERMANY","aleigator"

More typically tripel-like white pepper spice, clove, grass, ripe apple esters are allowed to briefly surface, but are then kept at dry bay by the dominant saison yeast blanket, making this near-refreshing at a walloping 9,5% and still very much a (n amped-up) saison. Creamier and more easy-going on tap, more hop-austere and near-metallic bottled.

Founded in 1970 , this beer was offered earlier this year to the most loyal customers of our brewery ( hence the name ""With the best wishes of the brewery Dupont ""). The success this beer earned lead to it being made commercially, while retaining its original name. Although very popular, it was brewed in limited quantities, the bottles reserved many months in advance. A coppery blond beer with aromas of hops for the Bon Voeux is a beer tasting combining mellow bitterness and fruity. Our selection of yeasts and a long maturation phase with hopping gives it flavor and a characteristic and complex taste.

This smells amazing. Heavy black pepper and phenols -- wet bandaid, latex, plastic. Some spicy yeast. Floral sweetness. The pepper is really the star of the show.

Taste is sweeter than I remember. Dry on the tongue to start. Spicy blonde flavor. Sweet malt backbone. A little floral or candied sweetness. Not much funk or bitterness leaves it a bit strong on the finish, not as dry as you'd want from a saison. Any dryness in the finish comes more from the spice. Slight alcohol burn is nice, the 9.5% is well hidden and only flashes it's presence in a good way. A very slight wateriness here or there.

Feels a little thin. Light body for a 9.5% saison is a bit disappointing.

Overall, I could smell this thing for days. I remember the flavor bring better last year, but I'll buy this every year just for the nose.

aussi, parce quil sagit dune blonde très forte (9,5 % abv), mais qui nest pas une triple.
Le site la classe comme « saison », mais cest en fait une spéciale forte refermentée en
bouteille. Mon exemplaire est une 37,5 cl du millésime 2011. Elle a donc 1 an et demi,
mais le brasseur la préconise en conservation longue en cave, dans mon cas jusquen
fin 2016.... Présentation très sobre de létiquette sur un fond bleu turquoise...
Bouchon de liège, même pour cette contenance faible de 37,5 cl. Très bien.
Couleur doré foncé brillant.
Clarté au léger voile de levure, qui est aussi présente en particules fines.
Bulles très vives partout dans le verre (et dailleurs forte explosion au débouchage).
Mousse blanche crémeuse qui tient à 5 mm.
Arômes de malt, whisky des lowlands, zeste dorange, pointe de poivre, houblon fleuri.
1ère bouche à la texture structurée, au départ sur le malt, avec un parallèle rigoureux sur
la levure. Arrière-bouche très ferme dune bière qui sait ce quelle veut, jolie nuance de
houblon, complexité du malt.
2ème bouche avec du malt et des épices en même temps, et du très grand art pour léquilibre
avec le houblon.
3ème nez sur les fruits blancs et la levure : superbe.
3ème bouche merveilleuse, à la texture plus soyeuse, puis plus épicée que la 2, avec une
tendance alcool de grain.
Longueur fantastique : équilibre, force, vigueur, profondeur, ampleur, complexité.
Levure un rien citronnée, de classe pure, splendide veine : une vraie levure supérieure.
Alcool solide, adéquat à une bière de ce niveau.
La finale développe encore (si cétait possible) le niveau des saveurs.
Conclusion. Grandeur et splendeur. Une très grande bière pour marquer la Saint Jean...

3239,"2012-08-05",3.8,"A: The beer is a yellow / orange hue and rather hazy. Barely detectable through the haze, I can see pockets of bubbles rising to the surface. The head is a gargantuan cumulus cloud that consumes the top half of the tulip glass, leaving copious amounts of sticky lacing throughout the glass.

S: Citrus and yeast are the dominant scents, with additional notes of spices, grass, lemon zest, and alcohol.

T: The flavor is very pleasant, with everything balanced quite well. Initially, the beer is so smooth on the palate, its a bit surprising. A touch of heat from the alcohol offers a bit of oomph in the finish, but I dont find it unpleasant. The abv is pushing double digits, after all. Citrus comes through prominently, but the yeast character is far more present in the aroma than in the flavor.

M: Medium-full bodied with an alcohol presence in the finish. The alcoholic presence gains a little speed as I delve deeper into the bottle. Avec Les Bon Voeux has a lingering aftertaste of citrus fruits and grass soaked in alcohol.

D: A terrific saison from a great brewery. Recommended.

4.0 A:  Lightly hazed golden wheat color.  Three fingers of frothy/foamy white head.  Retention is good and a lot of the foam sticks to the glass.

4.5 S:  Smells a good bit like autumn.  Lots of barnyard funk, rich with pollen, hay, and livestock.  Underneath there is pepper, clove, and corriander spiciness.  A garden of flowers in this while being moderately herbal.  Very complex and well integrated. 

3.0 T:  The taste is good, but not nearly as impressive as the nose.  Surprisingly strong oregano-like bitterness.  Not nearly as flowery as the nose, but about as herbal.  Corriander still stands out, but less pepper and clove.  Hay is back as is quite strong.  Dry even for a saison.  Bitterness lingers into the aftertaste.

The aroma is slightly prickly with a big blend of peach, apple, hops and a very light rum note too. The sight of the beer after pouring is stunning! A thick set white head with beautiful retention, soft and smooth looking. Sitting underneath the foamy head is a lovely golden-brown brew with a classic unfiltered murkiness. The taste of this beer is the real showpiece, its full of floral hops, Belgian yeast, malt and that classic Dupont edge that makes their brews so unique. The beer then slows into a pleasant lasting aftertaste of apples, pears and floral summery hops. Also the alcohol is well masked in the Bons Voeux which makes it very surprising. Great carbonation and feel on the tongue and mouth as a whole.

A lemony grassy aroma immediately greets my schnoz as I poke it into the glass. A slight funky brett smell is also present. And hints of alcohol present itself as well.

A sweet dryness is welcoming me to drink as much as I want from the glass. I think I will. There is also a slight earthy flavor mixed in with malt and wheat. A bit of a graininess as well. Very dry beer. This thing must have bottomed out on the fermentation. But there is such a slight sweetness that it makes you think it might not be that dry. Oh, but it is that dry. A very present alcohol lets you know it is there with each quaff. And the dryness is overpowered by a slight bitterness in the back end. Overall a very welcome saison after the mishandled other example I had years ago. 

This beer has renewed my hope that saisons might be a drinkable beer. The beautiful pour along with the lacing and color of this beer is very pleasing to look at.

A - Crisp golden honey with a large, light, foamy, bubbly, fluffy, soapy, white head. Great retention with a definite stickiness. Nice thick, bubbly lace left.

S - Very strong and complex aroma. Strong hay/straw aroma, not strong in the funk, but it has some that gives it a nice barnyard like aroma. Some orchard fruit in the aroma as well along with a hint of spice. Best description would be a barnyard with only a slight funk.

T - Stronger bitter, spice, and funk than the nose suggested. Starts out with a bitter, grassy hop flavor. This quickly goes to the hay/straw flavor with some funk and a lot more spice, especially pepper. Toward the finish, some tart orchard fruit makes an appearance. Slight alcohol warming. Tartness comes out stronger on the finish and lingers.

M - Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Very zesty feel with a drying finish.

D - Very easy to drink, especially given the ABV. Definitely has a tart and bitter taste that might slow down drinking just a little bit. Crisp, zesty feel is great for the saison and compliments the flavor.

Notes: Really nice saison. I think the overly strong tart and bitterness combined with the high ABV provide the slight downfall for this beer.

D- This is a good saison overall- the ABV is well hidden. It has an overall soft, slightly spicy character. I really like this one-but it doesnt rank among my personal top Saisons.

The alcohol is impressively hidden with the mouthfeel being slightly oily, slightly creamy, and lightly carbonated all at once. Fruity esters and light, crumbly caramel cookies begin in the flavor.

3239,"2010-05-04",3.9,"Pours a nice hazy blonde with a big head and good lace. The aroma is a bit soapy but this is made up for by the nice lemony and hoppy notes along with a nice fruitiness. The flavor is very dry and spicy with some good citrus rind, mineral. and hoppy notes. There is certainly some of the alcohol character in there as well. Its very good but doesnt have the sort of finesse that many other Dupont products do, perhaps I need to try it again.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Pours a light orange cloudy beer. A little fine laced white head. Very little carbon. Smell is very hoppy, even like canabis. A bit flat texture due to the little carbon, but this was probably because of the tap installation. Very balances taste. Mostly bitter, but also very spicy, koriander and citrus. Very long lasting dry aftertaste.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
3239,"2010-05-01",3.1,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2010 Bright, lightly hazed yellow, huge and very thick white, fluffy head with excellent lacing. Milder aroma than I expected. Tropical fruits, yeasty, some sourness vaguely resembling cherry. The taste is cheezy and moldy - neither is overpowering but they are the dominant features. Light citrus - maybe lemon, dry grass, pepper, dry and a bit tart feeling here, yeast and a bit of candy. I cant really taste the alcohol but there is some burn happening. Easy drinking but pretty much a boring 750ml of 9.5% beer that Ill probably pay for in the morning after also drinking USAlive prior to this.

3239,"2010-04-16",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2012 750ml 2008 bottle, 14C. Pours gold with an enormous white head that hangs around. Smells of rich fruit, lots of funky yeast, herbs and spices. Luscious mouthfeel. Alcohol becomes more obvious as it warms and you drink more of it. Quite scrumpy-like as well as tripelish. Lots of sweet/ sour complexity with some bitterness right at the end (and a long way past). A little sediment got into the second glass and was rather welcome - it fattened out the flavours and softened the alcohol. I liked it more as it warmed, though still a lot less than their normal Saison. [3.8] 
2009 bottle. Hazy gold with a large white head thats fairly well retained. Aroma: bready and cheesy yeast; fruity and boozy with orange zest and punchy pepper and cloves. Rich, tripelish mouthfeel with moderate but lingering spicy bitterness. Not very ciderish this time - more orange and caramel, maybe some pears. Think I would rate the last bottle higher now and will try an older one next time.Older turned out to be a bad idea, just turned lumpen.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark yellow with a huge, rocky, ever so slightly off-white head that slowly diminished and left beyond excellent lacing. There were also tiny particles in the body of an average duration. The aroma was light to moderate candy sugar; moderate floral hops; moderate to heavy doughy sweaty, leathery , cheesy, earthy, funky and spicy yeast; slight meaty yeast; apricot, peaches and oranges. The funk grew as it warmed. The initial flavor was acidic and lightly sweet; while the finish was sweet, acidic, slightly sour and fairly bitter. There was citrus, oranges, tangerine, sour fruit, yeast, candy sugar, cracker, apricot, spicy yeast, peach, peach pit, a bit of pepper, citrus rind, floral hops, light bread that was lightly toasted, musty and dusty yeast, slight funk, and citrus hops toward the end.

3239,"2009-12-31",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2010 25.4 oz. bottle. 2008 edition, according to the cork. Powerful aroma that is simultaneously fruit-sweet and chalk-dry. Wheaty smell features lemon, peach, and curacao on the fruit side and cinnamon, coriander, clove, cumin, and probably some other things that begin with the letter c on the spice side. Also a touch of cotton candy. Sharp and tangy as well as clean and yeasty aroma. Pours a cloudy, effervescent pale to moderate gold at the bottom of the glass, deepening to a rich gold to amber color as it rises toward the head. Huge amount of fluffy, uneven, thick, cream-colored head. Great lacing. Its really cool to see all the tiny bubbles ascending through the haze. The start of the taste is puckeringly chalky-dry, followed by just a touch of fruit before an even more intensely dry finish and long, lovely, mouth-wateringly dry aftertaste. Beautifully bone-dry; I cant think of a dryer beer that Ive ever tried. Like smoking a cigar without the icky tobacco, sitting next to a puffing chimney with no fire, or inhaling fine, delicious dust. It looks like liquid but feels almost gaseous in the mouth. Quenches and increases thirst at the same time. The parching dryness overwhelms the flavors, and yet I dont in the slightest mean that as a complaint. Light to medium body. Easy to drink yet filling. Avec les Bons Voeux de la Brasserie Dupont is a pleasure (and a great name to boot)! Its all about the palate, mouthfeel, and aftertaste. Its not the most wonderfully aromatic or most flavorful beer in the world (though it is strong in both categories), but it is a gem nonetheless. This is a great beer with which to end the decade. The best beer Ive had this year turns out to be the last one. What an experience! Feliz ano novo!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Strong spicy yeast, grainy, a hint of orange. So excited by the first impression that I was a little let down with the flavor.

3239,"2009-11-28",3.7,"Serving date: 2009-02-09. Served in tulip.

375 ml corked bottle with freshness date on the label (best before July 2013).

The pour is golden orange with straw hues - it almost looks like its glowing. Ivory-colored, big and creamy head that sticks around for a while before settling and leaving some foam on top of the brew and chunky lacings on the glass. A good looking beer.

In the nose, sharp medicinal phenols mix with a general spiciness and a smell of sweet citrus fruits. Faint smell of yeast as well. Despite plenty of phenols and tangy spices, the smell is rather fresh and pleasant.

Big taste of medicinal phenols - distinct taste of band-aids - and prominent spices (cloves, and perhaps white pepper?). Together with an unexpectedly big presence of alcohol this results in a interesting and pleasant - but still quite demanding - hotness. All of these tangy and sharp flavors are balanced by a taste of sweet fruits - mostly orange and lemon peel, but also pineapple - and faint malts. No funky flavors to speak of. The finish is dry with a more spices, minimal hop bitterness and a bit of a twang from the alcohol. This one develops very nicely towards the end: It gets a little less edgy, more round and balanced, as the sweet fruit flavors becomes more prominent.

Medium body, plenty of carbonation and all in all quite dry. But it still has a semi-smooth feel to it.

 A very good beer. Quite tasty as well. The big medicinal phenols and spiciness coupled with the sweet fruits makes it truly interesting, but also a bit demanding. Although it drinks really easily and is quite refreshing, the alcohol and the spices becomes a little too prominent and somewhat demanding after a while.

The head sticks around but it is small enough to where you can actually enjoy the beer without have to tip the glass in the air. Heavy aromatic skunk aroma with a nice backing of fruity yeast. That subtle fruit flavor is awesome. I will say this the beer has an odd almost brett-yeast like taste. It develops oddly. You get an odd funky yeast flavor then some spices, and then finally some fruit. Slight hop bitterness there at the end. Very carbonated beer; too carbonated in my opinion.

3239,"2009-08-04",3.8,"The Dupont Brasserie of Tourpes, Belgium is most renowned for their Saison Dupont, a Farmhouse Ale of epic proportions. Arguably the best Saison available in the world, I find that I cannot argue with that widely shared opinion, amateur and professional, for I myself also agree. The Dupont Brasserie also brews a few other year-round beers beside their traditional Saison, and that includes a yearly Christmas release called the Avec Les Bons Voeux.


She pours rather thick with a soft, hazy golden hue billowing into a creamy soft white head which shrinks slowly into randomly scattered pockets of bubbles. As I swirl her contents, she leaves both lace and a faint trace of tears along the sides of my glass, a testament to her thicker body. An orchard of oranges, mango, and honey greets my nose; and Im talking fresh, real honey, not the over-processed artificially sweet store-bought kind. Anyone who has supped and savored fresh honey right off the honeycomb knows exactly what I am talking about. A soft background of hay and supple leather gives her a rightful earthy quality while more oranges and some tangerines keep her nose fresh. Floral notes add to the blooming orchard essence while herbs and some peppery spices add a little excitement and daring to her journey. One last aromatic embrace of rubber, leather, and dry earth draws me into her wet embrace. Effervescent and frothy with a rich, thicker and heavier palate in comparison to her year-round older sister. To clarify, the Avec Les Bons Voeux is still considered a Saison, but she is a heartier version of what is traditionally a sessionable brew. she is very bright on top of my tongue where the freshly plucked sweetness of honey, orange, and mango dance followed quickly by her next number which features a more earthy ballet of leather, dry earth and wood which lingers in a long, clean finish. Bright and sparkling, we laugh together as her sweet nature frolics with dry herbs, grass, and more earth as wisps of coriander and citric rinds whisper. Her dry finish compliments her body perfectly, keeping an excellent balance between sipping and quaffing as one would a standard Saison. As we spend more time together, she grows a deeper, muskier nature with more barnyard notes and a burgeoning presence of tart funk. Refreshing, to say the least. I can see how the Avec Les Bons Voeux from the Dupont Brasserie is going to be one of my yearly holiday traditions.


Im not surprised in the least that she wowed and dazzled and wooed me to pieces. I expected nothing less from the Dupont Brasserie, and I look forward to seeing how the 2009 batch will hold true and diverge all at the same time. Just as every batch is Saison Dupont is a wee bit different, so too is the Avec Les Bons Voeux. I am thrilled I was able to savor a bottle this year, and look forward to next years, and maybe a mini lateral.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Served chilled in a Duvel glass...couldnt find anything more fitting.
Picture perfect glass of beer presents in front of me. Rocky 2-inch bright whtie head stands strong, clumping on its descent. Body is an orange-gold with uniform haze and very fine lively beading.
Spicy yeast on the nose, pepper and clove, possibly corriander and cinnamon but subdued at best. Bit of bread and vanilla, alluding to underlying maltiness, with some additional fruitiness; pear, lemon and orange peel. Faintest hint of alcohol.
Smooth, big yet somewhat well attenuated body. Carbonation is high but soft, lending a nice creaminess to the palate. Alcohol is very well hidden.
Sweet unfront, some white sugar and pale biscuity malt flavours. Ripe fruits follow; peach, pear, apple, orange, bit of banana, all somewhat kept in place with vanilla and clove, cinamon, nutmeg and coriander spices. Finishes reasonably bitter, a touch of grass, pepper and bread, all lingering as a sneaky warmth creeps down the throat.
Would have to say this is not only the best Saison ive tried to date, but well up there with the likes of Belgian Tripel/Golden Strong ales. Bit more body than a typical example of the style, but still somewhat delicate, with an excellent mix of spice and esters/phenolics from the yeast. Damn tasty!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Smell: Aroma smelling of bright citrus, tangy wheat, spices, apple peelings, and a sweaty, floral hop character. I must say, the funkiness coursing through the nose is fairly restrained.

Taste: Union of citrus, orange peel, and grassy florals. Tart and reasonably bitter even at the start. Some malted wheat, apple, and even flecks of sweet toffee begin to emerge midway. Hint of alcohol, a thoughtful reminder of the 9.5% contained within. Sip of still mineral water. Never more than a mild funk component. Some honey and sour lemon arrives late. Light touches of funk and sourness on the dry finish.

3239,"2008-04-26",4.0,"A- Pours a deep golden yellow hue. Slightly hazy with a huge frothy white head which leaves tons of lacing as it goes down. An absolutely beautiful brew.

S- Smell is very strong. Fruit notes, Belgian spices and yeast combine to make my mouth water.

T- This is where this saison lets me down a little, not because it tastes bad but because of the fact that it just seems unbalanced and after the amazing look and smell I had my hopes a little too high. As one might expect you get the same fruit notes as in the nose, very few of the spices and a belgian yeast which leaves a slight skunky Heineken flavor in your mouth. While this paragraph seems like I dont like the taste that isnt it at all. I think it is one of the best saisons I have ever had but I felt like it could be the ultimate with a couple tweaks.

M- Mouthfeel is very crisp, lingers on the palate a bit and seems to go down very smooth. Amazingly refreshing.

3239,"2008-03-13",3.9,"Ive had bad luck with Saisons thus far, perhaps it isnt the style for me. Dupont gave it a shot before, without success. Was it the smoky bar? My inexperience? I owed it to myself to give one of Belgiums traditions another chance. After all, Belgian styles have never betrayed me, why should they start? Still, that impossibly dry mouthfeel and caustic carbonation didnt sit right last time around. Nonsense! Here comes the pour. Les Voeux could hardly have started more beautifully. Golden as a mirabelle, its dense orange fog is set aglow by the light behind it. Pillowy, the dazzling white fluff laces lazily across the glass. A subtle aroma arises, light but fruity, and spicy too. Peach, apricot, nutmeg and some grain successively appear. The penetrating fragrance of Charentais melon plays jubilantly off of estery hints of bubble gum, banana and pineapple. Orange peel, clove and imperceptible coriander zest the concoction. In the background, a definite chalkiness and slightly sweet hint of funk are the hallmarks of authenticity. With renewed ambition, I take a confident sip. Funky  surprising and different  a dry cheesiness like a nutty Parmesan. Buttery hazelnut flavor is apparent throughout. The fruit is more subdued than I expected but despite copious alcohol none appears on the tongue. The frothy carbonation is pleasant, allowing for the sweetness of bubble gum and pineapple to really boogie. Finishing dry, a funky grainy thyme flavor leads to a somewhat salty aftertaste hinting at apricot. I am positively dying for a morsel of Parmigiano Reggiano, that addition alone would propel me to heaven. Im glad I followed my instincts, Dupont has crafted a wonderful brew.

Hazy orangey gold color with a white head that persisted. Mild lacing. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation.

Spicy and dry, peppery flavors, yeasty. Good carbonation provides a lively, medium to light mouthfeel. A mild peppery bitter closes the experience. A delightful saison!","Virginia Beach, USA","Immy"
3239,"2008-01-05",4.3,"Pours from bottle to chalice a deep, slightly hazy golden-orange color. Pour creates a thick, tight white head with great retention throughout the glass. Just a conucopia of complex luscious subtle aromas showing off notes of apple, pear, banana, lemon zest, fresh yeast rolls, coriander and clove with a touch of apricot. Pleasant livey mouthfeel with a full, fluffy body backed by a tingly spritziness. Flavors are crisp and tart starting off with a subdued fruity sweetness with flavors of ripe pear, apple, apricot and banana. This seamlessly melds into a more assertive flavor profile of slightly bittersweet lemon zest, herbs, spices and wood pulp finishing with a faint but balancing Noble hop and warming alcohol ending.

Aroma is rich and full of yeast, cloves, corriander, and perhaps a bit of orange citrus. Flavors are very nice full of doughy yeast and spices with a nice fruity flavor. Pineapple, pear, and banana all come through on this one. However there is a slightly funky flavor and bittering towards the end that lets the drinker know that this is truly saison. Mouthfeel is heavy and nice, almost chewy and the carbonation I found to be just about perfect. The alcohol in this one is also very well hidden as this beer is incredibly smooth.

3239,"2007-12-10",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2015 Corked and caged courtesy of boboski - thanks!  Cork reveals 2002 vintage - sampled here in December 2007.  Super spicy nose - malt- and coriander-heavy.   Yeasty with pear, pepper, orange peel, and a bit of lemon grass. Cloudy golden pour, but still very bright, with a dense creamy, rocky white head.  Taste is brightly malty and yeasty, with dominant coriander.  Full body with a little heft from the alcohol but no burn.  Feel is smooth as velvet, and the aftertaste is dry with just a bit of spicy heat/harshness.  Nice and woody, and not overly sweet like many a Saison.  Classy!  And rather excellent. [2007.12.10: 4.1]A second bottle, though Im no longer sure how it was acquired.  Cork says 2006 (actually 2.006), so around seven years old at this point.  Nose is creamy malt, yeast, lightly tart in the style of white wine, lightly honeyed.  Pours deep orange-golden with a large and dense creamy white head, just a beautiful fluffy meringue.  Heat is kept down and the alcohol mostly hidden for size, some beautiful and complex floral saison character and lighter herbal and peppery undertones.  No coriander this time, but faintest vanilla and some occasionally spiky sugary elements; I wouldnt call it sweet, but its not dry, either.  Rich, exciting honey character, pear and orange marmalade.  No bitterness or hops, extremely smooth and milky-creamy without any acidity at all, touch of smooth lubricating yeast, medium body.  This may be the softest mouthfeel Ive ever encountered, especially at this wallop; its like rubbing your cheek against a puppy or baby duck or Kashmir sweater.  What a wonderful, soul-nourishing drink! [2013.09.25: 4.5]P.S. to the second bottle: I actually managed a really clean pour into the first glass, but the second and third were much yeastier, and much more intensely flavorful!  Though theres an obvious trade-off -- any downy MF of that extremity is necessary mitigated by yeast addition.Third bottle, cork says 2.013, here in 2015.  Soft and dusty nose, lemony, tart with peel, honey.  Pours clear, rich golden with lots of carbonation and a foamy, dense, jiggly, lacing soapy white head.  Understated but beautiful range of esters, floral whispers, and again, that amazing yeast.  Smooth and richly malty with dusty noble character from the hops, lots of quick warming in the chest; I think this one might actually need a while to smooth down the alcohol!  Still very mellow.  Some mild mint and a lingering feeling of having drunk this directly after brushing my teeth (not the case), body is oily despite its excellent softness, digestibility.  Greatness from simplicity, once again, but looking at past ratings, I wish Id aged this another two years.  [2015.03.31: 3.9]  [Overall: still 4.5, for now.]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

The mouthfeel is full, smooth and creamy. The Finish is long and magnificent with many lingering complex flavors.

3239,"2007-11-18",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2012 The Saison is an incredibly difficult style to grasp.  Like the Quadrupel ot Belgian Strong, the label fails to grasp any of the beers real character.  We may say the Saison is ""light"", and we may say it is quenching, but these are qualities shared not only between saisons, but with water, tea, and even lemonade.  It is an entirely insufficient nomenclature, which is why I have tried my hardest to judge each Saison by itself.  Point in case, the Dupont Avec les Bons Voeux (DALBV for short).  The dandelion yellow-orange body sits meditatively in the glass, while I great roiling cloud of ruffled white head grows into an air-tight cap atop, sealing away the mellifluous aroma beneath.  A little excavating yields a sweet aroma underneath, its alloy of sugary and savory flavors making for a truly refined treat.  Pear juice, butter and popcorn elicit the familiar perfume of a sweet tripel, while a particular waft of sparkling ginger and cider perks the nose to attention.  The capacious aroma includes a floral movement, alongside the seasonally familiar smell of fresh rain and wet tree bark.  Finally, pineapple and a faint tangerine citrus lend their acidic traits to give the calm and sensible aroma a much needed spark.  This genteel fragrance speaks highly for the DALBV, while the palate and flavors show its stealthier, more indirect side.  On the palate it is very delicate and light, almost springy, with a sufficiently thin body to quench any lingering thirst on behalf of the drinker.  Alongside this jocular mouth feel a little pear flavor sighs, accompanied by a dab of honeysuckle.  However, the sweetness is mostly illusory, though in a magical, non-deceptive way.  In reality a rigid bread and graininess forms the main column of flavor.  The sweeter elements are simply sideshows, if incredible sideshows.  Because of its fragile nature, I could see the DALBV pairing very well with roasted and grilled vegetables like thick asparagus, red onions and zuchini.  The beers aftertase, a tingle of thyme and rosemary, makes the perfect pre-flavoring for oncoming vegetables.  Independently, a solid brew, and paired with food, excellent too.  This is, by all means, a unique and distinctive Saison, and one that could be well considered for promoting beers potential as a drink for culinary critics and savants.

1/2/2010 - A huge thank you from across the Atlantic Ocean, as we receive your gifts (well, sort of. I exchanged currency for it, but, you know, the sentiment is there...) from Belgian and the kindly hearts at Dupoint. The Le Bons Voeux is, like any good present, a foil to the malty dark winter warmers here, and a nice addition to a December menu of beer tastings. It pours with a huge, enormous head, much like the Duvel, and after a few moments of my intense gazing it collapses, either from exhaustion or embarassment, into a crater-in-a-crater shape. Im sure a geologist or an industrial designer could find something more inspirational to say, but my reaction will be, Whoah man! Awesome! The body of the beer is very cloudy and raw in appearance, slightly darker than a wheat beer, and roiling with carbonation. I have to wait awhile for this one to settle. Once it sits back down on its laurels, I catch a whiff of sticky sweet white grapes and caramelized sugar, but little else. The flavor is more sophisticated, swaggering with a delicate balance of sweet and dry and bolstered by a solid column of grain and smaller touches of white wine, white grape juice and honey. The flavor is fancy and light, and would pair bond strongly with something chewable. What makes this especially good is that its one of the first saisons (if not the first) that Ive genuonely enjoyed and the balance is really incredible.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Totally massive aroma - its belgian tripel exploding all over the place, the glass cannot contain it at all, has the perfumey aspects of a tripel, but theres a lovely saisony aspect, a spicey sharpness, too - thats the Dupont terroire which makes their saisons so good. Taste initially has quite an alcoholic kick, but after a few sips that just fades away. Its a lovely back-to-its-roots belgian ale, has a nice perfumey grain and noble hop component, but the saisony grunge is there too. Finish just has a light white pepperiness to it, to accompany the sweet grains. Shame about the alcohol, its in that Le Trappe territory, it could be called a quad at this boost.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Cork reads ""2006"" 

Opened with a lot of ""pop"". Avec les Bons Voeux pours a beautiful slightly hazed golden that glows when held to the light. A big 3+ finger fluffy white head formed on the pour that receded to 2 fingers and became craggy and meringue like. Left thick drink lines. Very refreshing looking beer.

When I popped the cork I took a quick smell and was immediately reminded of champagne. When in the glass this beer smells exceptionally polished. All notes go together so cleanly its difficult to pick them out. Mild floral aromas are present and mingle seamlessly with a faint haylike barnyard funkiness and candi sugar sweetness. Tart green apples come along too. Still shows champagne like qualities. 

This is the best saison Ive ever expierenced by a long shot. Yes this beer is an expierence. Wonderfully done. Faint sugary sweetness along with a very mild funkiness go perfectly with the floral undertones. Green apple tartness gets in the mix as well. As this beer warms the green apple shows through more and more. Very refreshing.

Light body with a solid amount of carbonation. Glides through the mouth very nicely. Leaves the tongue awakened. Finishes somewhat dry.

I could, without a doubt, drink this beer all day long. Refreshing and light bodied. Very easy to drink.

This is a world class beer and one of the best, most polished saisons Ive ever had. Crisp and refreshing to the point of almost being too easy to drink, considering such a high abv. Wonderful creation.

The creamiest hops fall out of the glass and prickle the senses before it even touches your lips. Mouthfeel is surprisingly delicate but spritzy at the same time. Almost funky in the mouth with plenty of what you want from this type of beer but its the finish that really makes this a killer.

3239,"2007-01-18",4.2,"My only addition to a small tasting we had here in Perth late last year. Tasted late into the evening, about number twenty on the list. This poured a gold tinged, deep yellow and hazy in the light. Carbonation was very fine, raising up with force to the biggest, rockiest white head I have ever seen be retained so well. It holds like the surface of the moon and laces wildly as the beer recedes. Fruity esters in abundance - sweet banana and pineapple, tart, bitter peaches and oranges, some tight lemon - this was lovely to whiff, a literal fruit punch that just keeps releasing. It is creamy in the mouth (tasted at room temperature), the carbonation tickles but doesnt detract from its creamy, soft mouthfeel. Tight tart fruit again here, juicy but dry and quick to draw on the saliva glands. A little pineapple and banana, not as prominent as the aroma. Musty barnyard grains, some earthy, woodiness and good ol house yeast flavours settle in comfortably amongst the fruit. Peaks with confidence, a fruity bitter, bite on the swallow, becomes sour and dries out for the considerably long, quenching length. Alcohol - youd be forgiven in thinking this was an N/A beer as it was not in evidence for both warmth and feel. This is Summer in a bottle, perfectly balanced, juicy but dry, bitter, tight, lovely.

Lively, but nonetheless, soft carbonation (is that a contradiction?) and light ""fluffy"" mouth feel. Long aftertaste with a little alcohol.

3239,"2006-12-30",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2013 Draft 
2006 at Brouwers. Dec 30 06. 
Hazy straw amber with a modest white head and lovely lacing. This beer has a splendid aroma of lemon, barnyard dust, and a hint of vinegarly lambic. The flavor is stunning: lemon and lovely - nay, perfect - bitter hops, more barnyard, a hint of sunflower seed, and warm sweet malts through the middle. The mouthfeel is full and rich without either the heat or the thickness one might attribute to a 9.5% beer; as a result, this one is packed beyond compare with flavor but remains refreshing nonetheless and despite its high alcohol content. 

After 600+ ratings, this is the best beer Ive ever tasted. My new top-rated beer by two points.

Revisit on tap, Feb 18 07. Indeed, after my encounter with the bottled version (described below) I began to wonder if the rating above resulted from one of those fortuitious moments where the beer and the mood and palate and the setting all align in perfect synchrony to raise a very good beer to beyond excellent in the moment. 
So the next day, I tried this again on tap, again at Brouwers. The previous 4.7 (9/4/10/5/19) was no fluke; that beyond-perfect mouthfeel was back, the beer was everything I had experienced the first time, and it was fully deserving of its position alone at the top of my list.

Bottled
Relatively fresh, 2/2007. 750 ml, 2006 bottling tasted Feb 17 07.

From the bottle, this is a somewhat different beer. Its very good, still, but it doesnt compare with the mind-blowingly good beer that I tasted on tap. Much of the loss is in the mouthfeel. The bottled version features a coarser head; it is harsher and lacks the smooth creamy fullness of the tap, substituting instead a more oily mouthfeel and more overt 9.5% alcohol. I probably would have rated this about a 4.2 if I was tasting it for the first time.  The take-home lesson is that if you havent had this one on tap, you havent had the full experience of what it can be.

Fresh Bottle 10/2012.  Alright, I gotta downgrade this one. It may be divine on tap, but its human in the bottle based on yet another too-hot, bit-too-sticky fresh bottle tasted 10/2012. Id go about 8/4/8/4/16=4.0 on the bottle, but Ill split the different with draft.
Fresh Bottle 12/25/13. Pretty amazing this time around, not hot, barely sticky. Just delicious, drier than I remember.  Two main things going on here. The less amazing of the two is a strong stone ground wheat thin cracker flavor coming from the malts, even bringing some sweetness one the palate acclimates.  The other, which is the true soul of the beer, is the massive sulfur and mineral character of the house yeasts. A delight that Id rate around 8/4/9/4/17=4.2.
Bottle four years old
2006 bottle, May 2010. This one is better fresher, I fear. Now the bready malts and a minerally base are at the forefront, and its just not the beer it once was. Its still really good -- 3.9 to 4.0 range -- with no glaring flaws. But I concede that it wasnt really meant to be aged.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

This isnt exceptionally complex like some saisons, but very well balanced.  Although it is unusually high in alcohol for the style, it is completely hidden in the aroma and flavor.

Very well carbonated and needed to be poured in stages.  Despite the high ABV, its very drinkable, and the alcohol is well masked.  Somewhat of a muted mouthfeel (for a saison), but it was rather spicy (peppery and clove) and rather funky.  Very refreshing and very drinkable.

3239,"2006-10-30",4.0,"Bottle (from BItter Virtue, Aug 2010). Deep golden. Peppery and zesty orange hops with firm dry malts and yeast character which at times is fruity and others has a chalky earthy character. The real highlight of this beer however is the subtle combination of flavours in the mouth and the overall feel. The firm malts provide a backbone throughout whilst the solid hop bitterness doesnt overpower the subtleties. There is an almost tart flavour which never quite develops fully but acts as an interesting counterpoint between the malt and hop flavours. With a 750 of strong belgian beer it can sometimes be a bit of a struggle to finish it but this went down the hatch quite easily.","Southampton, Hampshire, ENGLAND","Mungo"

3239,"2006-10-10",3.8,"This corked and caged bottled brew bottled in 2005 came from a bottle shop and poured a extremely large sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored bubbles that was mostly lasting and left behind a hazy softly carbonated dark . The aroma was fruity farmhouse malty and doughy. The crisp mildly vinous mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mellow finish. The crisp saison flavor contained notes of mild hops fruits and was mildly vinous. Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3239,"2006-10-03",4.4,"750 mL bottle, not sure of the vintage.  This pour was just beautiful... slightly hazy medium golden with a tall cap of creamy white head... some rising carbonation.  Left a dense, intricate lacing behind... some sediment at the bottom of the bottle.  Loved the nose, too... soft whipped lighter fruits, lemony alcohol, dusty spices, and citrus zest rounding it off.  Flavor was even better... lemon was prevalent throughout, providing moderate tartness.. dusty and musty yeast gave it an old feel... lots of peppery spices... and grassy hops.  Tartness and alcohol warmth increase as this approaches room temp.  Exceptionally soft on the palate and refreshing.  Higher carbonation worked well, and the alcohol was highly complimentary.  This was an exceptional beer!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3239,"2006-10-02",4.5,"Perfect gold with a orange tinted center. Slighly paled and definately hazed from the tons of activity that swirls and dances around within. Carbonation is fevered and running for a long time after every pour. Tiny specks of yeast and spices thread themselves inbetween the bubbly action. The head is towering and creamy with a lightly stained whiteness that resembles home made whipping cream. Not to mention the staying power this cap has. It takes for ever to subside from all the carbonated action. Only from sipping does it get taken away. The lacing isnt really lacing at all, its left over creamy clumps and shelves that sit around the top of glass in areas that Im not sipping from. Incredible appearance! I could go on, but...

Aroma is adequately forward with a lemony spice, dried grasses, airy yeasty dried spice, and pale breads. As it begins to finally settle in after a length the warming temp tends to get an over riped, fruity funk of pineapple and banana skins. The malts really turn it around into something quite different. Still takes alot of wiffing to get the subtlities down as well as its overall nose. But quite capativating, non-the-less.

Taste is firm and standing tall. Takes you right in and begins the ride of complexity thats nearly overwhelming. Lots of weird but interesting spices fly up and down and around the center of a pale bready, semi soured tangy center of sweetness. Yeasty things are always there as is a fruity sense of dulled and over ripe citrusy stuff. Kinda stuffy, fairly bold, easliy rich, inticing, slimming dryness, moderate malts, and faint notes to citrus peels and their bitterness and parching effects. One super complex flavor thats ever changing from sip to sip. Something new captured in every sip. A nice aspect to what seems to be its dulling character. I think its the spices, which are peppery, yeasty, floral, dry, grassy, and not withstanding any real overplay as it helps balance the funky fruity paled sweetness.

Feel is solid and active, at first, once it settles and is at the bottom, trailing end of its offering, it gets completely awesome. Warm, spicing, airy, creamy, rich, malty, spicy again, some dryness, more spices, wow, it never stops making an impression. Some lasting sips bring the warmth right into the nose with spices and warmth. To me thats an impression.

The drinkability is quite good and can be put back easliy enough, yet that 9.5 % sneaks right in and lets you know and reminds you to slow it down for full enjoyment at the proper stage of the beers life. An incredible Saison thats sure to blow the mind of any worthy connoisseur of the style. Seemed at its peak of interest to me at around 60 degrees. So serve warmer then the norm for most and enjoy.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Bitter orange peel graces through soon thereafter, moments before the yeast strain lets you know its the reason why were all here.  Take a sip and were quite certain that this is one seriously flavored saison.  Buttery sweet dough and vanilla buttercream seep in over sucked on lemonheads.  Coriander gives a subtle scratch, but the confectionary bakers delight pursues and even sweeter path.  Big puffy effervescence and in the dry recession, the spices coriander and chamomile rise up splendidly.  Bakery lemon meringue cuts close to spruce.

I lost track of who brought this or opened it, but thanks to whoever did.   There is a reason this is one of the highest rated saisons on the site -   because it deserves the honors.

Aroma / Appearance - A huge, dense yellow bubbly head subsided slowly,   trickling down the sides of my glass leaving behind traces of lacing that   lingered.  The bouquet was rich with fruity notes - apples, pears and an   overall sweetness.  In addition, I was reminded of honey smoked ham as it   hung in the rafters aging.

Flavor / Palate - The first impression was dry and peppery but soon   gave way to a pleasant combination of sweet fruity flavors.  The mouthfeel   was just about right for a saison.  It did not completely fill my mouth with   intense flavors, but at the same time I did not have to guess at what pleasures   were in my mouth.  The spicy characteristic stuck around throughout the entire   glass.  It was never overpowering or intense but gave a nice balance to the   beer.  I enjoyed this; if I see if on the shelf around Madison it might be   getting a second look in the future.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Surprisingly peppery in the mouth, with some alcohol notes becoming apparent. In this sense, it was very much tripel-like. More funk and citrus flavor notes made their way into the mix as the beer warmed.

3239,"2006-06-07",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2009 2005 Vintage, this one poured a nice golden to slight orange color with a humungous (but somewhat manageable) head that just pillowed and stayed there forever. The lacing was outstanding, rings all the way around and down the glass. The aroma was deceiving, somewhat sweet, yeasty, and spiced. The flavor started out somewhat funky, horse blankets, barnyard, and yeast with a mildly bitter (very pleasant) finish. As it warmed, the wheatiness came out. However, the finish was peppery and dry, really quite nice, keeping this from going too sweet like the Hennepin, which is supposedly from this style. The alcohol hid amazingly well initially and without food, however, the turkey and nuts really drew out the alcohol astringency.... very nice, all said and done. Re-rate, 12/09, on draft at SL: So smooth and excellent, a big Belgian appeal with the elements of light fruits, some pepper, very light off funk, great stuff, spices. Hennepin to the extreme and excellence. Missed a few vintage bottle re-rates, sometimes on the hotter alcohol side of things, but a great annual brew.","","User37895"
3239,"2006-06-03",3.7,"Bottle purchased at Piccadilly, Champaign. Im once again reminded that Saison must be one of the most versatile food pairing beers available. Hot food, well spiced food, grilled, it can do it all. Enjoyed on a cool summer night with some food on the grill. Notes of lemongrass, citron, orange pell, coriander, chamomile, and a pleasant citrus hop finish. Fairly thin of palate and overly carbonated are its flaws.

It was nice and tart and not too spicy.  It would be hard to drink more than one of these and still be able to talk, but Ill try.

3239,"2006-03-12",4.9,"The beer was picked up from Greens in a green bomber with a cork and wire cage.  The vintage 05 was visible on the side of the cork before opening.  The thud heard while uncorking was resoundingly solid, and the body poured out pale golden, clear, and well carbonated, and formed a head that built up above the rim of the glass.  It was very Duvel-esque in its looks, which is almost always a sign of good times ahead.  The carbonation never ceased during the entire drinking session.  And the lacing had to be seen to be believed.

The aroma was yeasty and spicy, and had hints of lemon peel and hay.  These smells are usually associated with mild smelling beers, but this one was as aromatic as a West Coast IPA.  The taste was bone dry and refreshing due to the tart and spicy flavors floating atop ethanol.  Very delicately balanced, yet quite bold, this was a superlative ale in its primacy.   The mouthfeel was light and ephemeral, and the aftertaste peppery and tantalizing.  If there was any fault to be found here, it was in the highly spicy character throughout, which might not appeal to everyone.  Bust as you might have figured out by now, spiciness increased the appeal of this beer to me.

The nose on this beer is very complex, with big aromas of pale malt, spicy/herbal hops, and peppery alcohol.

This rich malt is paired with some nice estery fruit flavors, and some lift of carbonation that allows it to dance on the tongue.

The flavor was moderately sweet and moderately bitter with an average-length, lightly bitter finish. The flavor was remarkable in that the initial balance was extremely on, but the individual sensations were quite discernablelike hearing a tone in either ear.

An initial bit of skunkyness but that passes as the brew gets a chance to breath.  Bright gold in color with good clarity.  Light and crisp flavor with more fruityness, some spices (pepper), a nice alcohol warming and a big helping of green sour apples.  Finish has a little alcohol kick that goes right to the head.

When I finally got the rest into my glass, I got all the yeast. Not sure if that is a good or bad thing. It has the horsey Belgian smell, with some Granny Smith apples thrown in for good measure.

Tingly esters filled with honeycomb, rose petals, sweet pale malts, and slightly sour golden raisins.  There is a light astringency from the hops, but its evened out by creamy green apple sweetness and vanilla yeast complexity.  Fluffy and moist doughnut finish  spicy yeast and creamy, vanilla icing.

I get a lot of yeast background from this beer and a nice dose of oak. The finish has a wonderful spicy note and the citric nature comes rushing forth.

Looks majestic poured into a St. Bernardus goblet, lush creamy head, hazy pale orange appearance, ...angelic.
Aroma, captivating, airy, light citrus, minor sour tones, vibrant fruit, apricot, peach, lemon, gets bolder by the minute, unfolds tangy-er fruit notes, ...uplifting.
But its in the taste where I was taken back, and I still dont know if I have language for it, but let us make a valiant effort, anyway.
Fruit floods the mouth, but the body is exceptionally light, almost ethereal...it paints a coating of delicious around the mouth that pulls away like a phantom, the echo of this gorgeous fruit flavor, plump with yeast, lingers, resonates, titillates, entices...another sip is in the offing, but it becomes a gulp, and the swallow is urgent, but the effect is the opposite, a magnificent restfulness overcomes me, a mellow rapture,... it stirs the mind and soul, and quenches thirst along the way.
Each new sip delivers a similar shock, a brand new spank to the senses, a reacquaintance with this magical feeling.
Body is light, but the flavor is powerful and pure, and the finish is long, fruity, perfectly smooth. I laugh at the 9.5% but feel it creeping in as I drain the glass.
Hey, maybe its just the mood Im in, but this glass of beer has an absolutely elevating effect. The strength eventually enters into the flavor like a wily snake through a grassy field....lightly spicy, too, to match the fruit...call me a sucker if you must, but I feel my soul has been cracked open, freed and sent aloft, metamorphosized, like hearing new beautiful music for the first time, have a soft spot touched and felt that shiver...

As I pour this beer into my glass I get an aroma that is enticingly sharp, grassy and herbal all together.  The beer is a lightly hazy straw gold color, it is topped by a frothy, rocky off pale white head.  Ooh, the aroma is quite nice it has aromatic notes of bergamot, fresh cut hay, wild flowers, lemon zest, vanilla, and perhaps a soft woodiness.  The aroma is quite smooth and almost mellow in character, though it is quite complex and intriguing.

This beer starts out smooth but then starts to pick up a sharpness in the middle, but then finishes with a lingering malty smoothness.  This beer is quite tasty, it does not have the complexity of the Saison Dupont, but it is still quite tasty and much more mellow and smooth tasting.  The flavors that meld together in this beer are quite nice, I get notes of lemon, pepper, ginger, a tannic woodiness, and some sharp herbal notes.  This beer has a really nice flowery, almost nectar like, quality to it that is just so smooth and satisfying.  It really hides its alcohol quite well.  This beer is quite tasty and is really growing on me more and more as I drink it.

In the end this is just a wonderful mix of flavors, textures and aromas.  This beer is quite good, and is perhaps my second favorite (after the Saison) from this incredible brewery.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Dry, with big, almost sour yeasty/farmhouse notes with big fruit flavors (pear, apple), caramel and this is awfully hoppy by the way.  A very good beer.

Lightly hazy, with a few flecks of yeast suspended.  It smells earthy, like damp hay and mold, with some rusty, lightly citric bitterness and a dry caramel nuttiness.  The flavor is full and rich, with a huge yeast apparency, persistent sweetness from the honey-almond like malt, with dry caramellized sugar notes.  Grain-like spicy notes abound throughout, with a pleasing, zesty mouthfeel and medium-full body.

Cool driness helps to finish the brew and makes it unwittingly drinkable.  Enjoyable throughout.  Great beer.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Superb lacing.  Delicious, subtle yeasty nose with pear, apple, pepper and light coriander and clove.  Slightly doughy and subtly sweet in the nose.  Initial taste is like a Belgian golden ale, slightly bitter, moderately yeasty, with a touch of pepper.  Finish has moderate dryness with slight sting of alcohol and delicious warm hum; wonderful seque from the first taste into the smooth, lasting, crisp and elegant finish.  Not too much, but definitely plenty there.  Full body.  Just wished the head lasted longer than it does.  Bitterness lasts a long time on the finish, as does the peppery coriander/yeast combo.

Im not a ratings whore, Im not doing it just to get the rating.  But I figured it was time I had an absolute favorite beer.  Their Saison is pretty high up there.  But this one(hey_kevin and I discussed it as being a tripel) blows me away.  Hops.  This is a wonderful, hoppy tripel.  It isnt thick or watery.  Perfect.  Once of the finest smelling beers Ive ever had.  Alcohol is hidden bu a wonderful menage-a-trois of hops, yeast and malt.  Some nice farmyard character sneaks up too.  I cant say more.

Flavor matches, but goes through stages as it warms.  In the beginning, the finish has a dry, spicy note, almost a hop bitterness.

3239,"2004-06-11",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2007 2002 vintage: Explosive cork removal.  Faded yellow body with some haze. Climbing white head from the surging carbonation. Impeccable lacework. Luxurious aroma of buttercup, peppery hops, and perfumey esters. Perfect level of airiness and vibrant yeast complement the pale malts and sugared white grapes. Light swirls unleash sweet cream, coconut, and coarseness from the hops. Seductively creamy, dense, yet expansive, carbonation. Moderate sweetness from the start with a dessert apple, white grape, glazed malt medley. Fresh flowers soften the body and reduce the sweetness while the hallmark Dupont yeast goes to work and continually films the palate while adding some cakelike thickness. Remarkably restrained fruity esters, apple acidity, and vivacious Styrians try to expunge the alcohol, but the alcohol eventually wins and warms the belly. Leafy hops gradually strut toward the finish alongside muted mustiness and juicy hops. Fluffy, fresh cake moistness (less dry than the regular Dupont) in the finish with a balance of apple skins,  flowers, and yeast astringency. Juicy hops and sweet white grapes remain amid herbs and fading pale malts. Only flaw is the (relatively) poorly-hidden alcohol in the flavor. Earth shattering every time.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3239,"2004-04-18",4.6,"Matta is such a stellar individual  Clear liquid gold wearing a foamy, frothy, rocky gigantic-sized white head. Very carbonated body. Gotta love such a complex aroma that never hinted at being not as great as expected by me (who still recently fell under the charm of their Dupont Forêt). Ultra farmy, dry and yeasty, very yeasty obviously like all other Dupont. Lovely barny and spicy hints. How can you not love a fine Saison. Bone-dry (made me think of chalk at times) with awesome white wine aspects. Deep spice profile includes coriander, basil, pepper, thyme, mint, sage and just various other herbs. The first sip proposes a malty attack with lots of dry hay, some apple and so much yeast. Finish is dry with a grassy hop bitterness, but remains restrained and balanced. Aftertaste comes back to haunt me with suggestions of dust and spices and that scores big points with me. So herbal, so intense and no alcohol to speak of although there's a charming warming effect. Body is medium, quite carbonated, mouth-cleaning for sure and lightly tart at times. Marvellous Marvel. I'm truly impressed and in great thirst of Saison for the rest of my days.

3239,"2003-08-12",4.9,"2002 750mL Bottle served at 10ºC in a saison flute.
Upon opening, the cork exploded off the bottle with tremendous force almost putting a hole in my ceiling...impressive. Pours a crisp beige sand color with large white champagne like head, lacing sticky as a Hawaiian gecko's feet. Aroma is RICH with ripe citrus fruit and a terrific tart barny background, best saison aroma I've had yet, world class. Flavor is complex sour with barely a hint of alcohol, this is has wonderful leather flavors and sweet complexities. Hints of unfermented candi sugar are there too, so this would age to a 5 I believe. Fruity carbonated finish with a slight tart alcohol feel to keep the background full of surprises. The aroma in this one is what goes the distance for me; I would give it a 12 if I could, so the bonus points spill over into the overall category. Saison's are my favorite type of beer and are very unique and hard to find, I feel this is the best beer I've had up to date. Cheers!<P>Post Drinking Comments: I noticed that when the yeast was included at the end of the bottle, the flavor profile was dramatically affected and the citrus flavors were now dominated by a toasty chewy funkiness. I was meticulous with keeping this bottle stored properly and pouring slowly and I was well rewarded; keep this in mind if you ever have this one.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

We used Garrett Oliver's new book, ""The Brewmaster's Table,"" to decide to have this with the grilled tuna and mango salsa we were having for dinner.  It paired wonderfully.  It has a slightly sour, yeasty aroma with some candy sugar in the background.  The flavor is very, very pleasant.  Sweet, slightly alcohol, light, but rich.  It does have quite a lot in common with a tripel, which happens to be my current favorite style.","Washington DC, USA","Kathy"

Its been a long time since Ive had a 4+ bottle of Avec. Despite its breeding and being well-made, its just never that exciting or something I want to drink much of. And thats mostly for two reasons: the alcohol, and the relatively mild/quiet aroma. Its all the usual Dupont aromas, but theyre always quieter in this one than the other Dupont brews. Which allows the high alcohol to stick out more, both in the aroma and in the afterburn as well. I still feel a bit romantic about the beer, but the reality is that I never buy more than one per year and rarely drink much of the bottle. While the 2016 regular Dupont Saison was much better than usual, the Avec is about the same as always.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Its dry-hopped now, and it cuts the sweetness considerably. Like liquid flowers and herbs, flowing all over your sweet cottony saison. Lovely. Original: Highly spicy and also pretty sweet and also a lot of alcohol. Umm. Thats not bothering me tonight! Actually, I like the little bit of barnyard stink in the nose, the itty bitty wafts of candi sugar, but theres no weird herbal essence or minerality. It is a lot like a triple.

3239,"2002-10-04",3.9,"Sprigs of pine and peels of lemon form a subtle cloud of aroma.  The thin solid white head lasts and lasts, even as it thins, floating over a light yellow straw-gold lake that thins around the edges. I have to say, that this has quite a bit of originality in taste. It starts out a bit thin and lemony, then it sits on your lounge for a while and warms it up without any aftertaste, and for a final bow, it wows you with a spiced up, almost cinnamon like finish loaded with a good balanced dry bitter hop and alcohol finish, very complex in the end.
