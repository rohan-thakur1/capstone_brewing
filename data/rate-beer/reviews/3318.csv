3318,"2017-04-12",4.1,"Tap @ at source. Pours hazy deep golden with a white head. Aroma of loads of fresh hops, quite spicey, light herbal, light lemon drops, loads of minerals, very clean nose. Taste is quite bitter from the others, loads of herbal hops in the taste, clean and refreshing!","Odense C, DENMARK","MrOrla"
3318,"2017-01-20",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Mild caramel meets earthy, orangey hops and their green bitterness in this rustic Zoiglbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the misty amber.
-The mouthfeel on this one wasnt too carbonated compared to other Windischeschenbach and Neuhaus Zoiglbiers that weekend. I thought this softer bubbling actually worked better with the malty profile and made the beer a standout.
-The flavour profile is balanced.
-The quenching factor is quite high.

On tap at their zoiglstube.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

3318,"2015-11-28",2.6,"Draft ungespundetes pour during a private visit. All Hallertau Perle hops and Pilsner and Munich malt. Hazed amber gold with a short white head of large bubbles. Aroma is strongly sweaty and game-y with malty notes of caramel and pancakes with quieter notes of pepper-spice-spruce needle-evergreen, something I assume is a combination of hops, brewers yeast, and bacteria. Plus theres something like fennel or cardamom up in this wonky nose. Altogether an unpleasant aroma but unique and distinct from every other Zoigl Ive had from Windischeschenbach. Medium bodied, sweet with medium-low bitterness, low carbonation leaves it flabby and syrupy, but the burnt pancake batter maltiness is actually somewhat decent in the mouth, not as sweaty-gross as in the aroma. Pretty odd having it nearly flat but thats the intent with not adding CO2 to the tank. Still I have to score it as I taste and smell it, and this one is just plain undesirable, but I have mad respect for the brewer and his ways.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Aroma is mild with fresh fruity hop and sundried grain. Low carbonation. Soft and very easy to drink. Pretty thin in the finish after going through a citrusy and yeasty middle. Balanced and nice.
