Flavor is quite alcoholic, fruity, rise and flower with a slightly harsh finish but not in a bad way. Medium body.

1570,"2011-04-16",3.1,"Bottle. The body has a little yellowish tint to the clear body. The aroma has a cellary touch, but is mostly fruity. Apples and a touch of pears. The flavor is much the same, with some rice and a pleasant flowery touch. Something licorice like in the far back of the flavor. Alcohol too of course, imparting a lasting warmth. A pleasant sake, maybe a bit warming, but tasteful. 110416","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
