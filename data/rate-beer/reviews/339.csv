339,"2016-08-23",4.5,"Bottle at Culmination Fest 16: Somehow I missed this one last year, but was not going to let that happen again. Poured a straw yellow that cleared up in the glass a bit over time with a white jello ring head. Aroma was pungent fruit and oak. Taste was funky pungent fruit, super aged, oak clings to the palate some acid effect.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
339,"2016-07-02",4.2,"The beer is a goldenish yellow color. Fairly cloudy. Small white head. The aroma has a depth of funk that puts it in a separate class from all other de Garde beers. This beer legitimately smells like lambic. It has a wonderful earthy funk to it. Light lemons, light malt sweetness. Dry taste with plenty of funk. A bit too tangy sour, but thats only relative to lambic. Medium to moderate pucker. Fairly light body. Good stuff.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
339,"2016-05-01",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2016 Poured from a Batch 1 bottle. Aroma is actually really nice! Nice funk note with a decent herbal, earthy characteristics. Some citrus and pineapple notes, but the funk leads the way. Hints of tropical fruit. Pours a hazy, dull gold with a fairly large, thick white head that steadily recedes. No lacing or legs. Flavor is fairly acidic with a bit of a sharpness to it. Moderate pineapple and citrus notes with some lemon. Medium light oak notes. Less funk than in the aroma, but still some light earthy and herbal funk. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a great beer. Quite possibly my favorite de Garde beer ever. This has funk unlike any other beer of theirs. Acidity is a touch sharp, but nothing too crazy. Some light fruit notes add soem complexity as well.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
339,"2016-02-27",3.7,"Bottle shared by Kevin at a small share. I had no idea of the hype behind this until after I had a glass. #newmoney beer bros seem to be all over this, sorry I didnt know. Pours a light yellow with small to minimal carb/head. Aroma is leather, tart lemon and cheese funk. It was a little unpleasant at first but then I grew to like the aroma more than anything else on this beer. Citrus taste is there and oak but this really doesnt distinguish itself much from other American dry sours.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
339,"2016-01-09",4.3,"Bottle shared by Jared. Pale golden color with low carb. Aroma is oak, lemon, funk, light cheese, and apricot. Taste is high tartness with dry oaky finish. Complex bright and delicious.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
339,"2015-12-27",4.2,"Bottle in a De Garde glass. Pours hazy golden with white head. Aroma of light sourness/tartness, light funk, some light fruits, some pale malts, and hints of oak. Flavor the same with a blend of the funk and sourness and light fruit/malts. Nice carbonation. A very solid beer.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
339,"2015-12-18",4.2,"Bottle at Dangerous Bottleshares #14 Feat Emma and Aaron! Thanks Em and Aaron for this whale! Pours a hazy golden-orange with a big, fizzy, white head. Aroma has tons of funk, leather, cheese, oak, green apples, slight grapes, pretty dirty! Taste is very sour, vinegary, lots of oak, dry and fruity. Dirty and fruity; Apricot, grapes, green apples, lemon, gooseberry. High carbonation and a light, crisp body - unlike the real gueuzes, which would probably be a bit more oily. Still doing great as a gueuze style beer!","Aarhus C, DENMARK","Vestergaard"
339,"2015-11-21",3.7,"Bouteille 75cl de et partagée avec Pierre T.
Dorée, léger trouble, col blanc disparaissant vite.
Arôme offre un bouquet malté, grains moût, le tout est légèrement fleuri en rétro-nasal avec ne petite note de funk et boisé.
Palais est sec, terreux, râpeux présentant des éléments rappelant un jeune lambic surtout dans la composition des grains. Chêne ressort bien, le tout est finement citrique sans être dans le surfait.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

339,"2015-10-05",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2015 Bottle @ Dangerous Bottleshare 14. Thanks Aaron and Emma for sharing. Pours hazy yellow orange with a white head. Aroma is funky with lots of cheesy notes, moldy oak, some lactic de garde tartness, unripe apples, gooseberries and some weak vinegar. Nice! The taste is lactic and tart with notes of gooseberries, sour apples, oak, funk and with a dry mouthfeel. This is very high carbonated compared to a traditional lambic and also has that characteristic de garde lactic feel to it.","Aarhus, DENMARK","RasmusOtt"

339,"2015-07-12",4.8,"The aroma was very distinctive, reminding me of burning rubber. The color was hazy and golden with a slight white head. You could taste the fruit up front but the tartness followed close behind. Medium bodied, perhaps slightly creamy, it had average carbonation with a slightly astringent finish. This is De Gardes first Lambic style beer and if this is any indication of what they can do, we are in for some treats.","Oregon, USA","HoppyToday"
