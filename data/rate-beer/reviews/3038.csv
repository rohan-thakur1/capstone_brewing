Aroma is failry rich and malty with lots of dark caramel and toffee with some lighter roast and medium light chocolate to balance the caramel. Some medium light bourbon notes with some light alcohol spice. Medium light raisins, figs and prunes. Faint hop notes. 
Pours dark brown with some lighter brown and amber hues on the edges. Small, somewhat thin, tan head recedes fairly quickly to the edges where it lingers for a bit. Medium light lacing and fairly long legs. 
Flavor has a light sweetness with some moderate dark caramel and toffee notes; not as super sweet as a lot of barley wines which is nice. Some light roast and medium light chocolate notes. Medium bitterness with faint pine hop notes. Medium bourbon character with light oak and medium light alcohol spice. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium alcohol warmth. 
Overall a really nice barley wine; I really enjoy that it has a slightly darker malt profile and avoids the overly strong burnt sugar note that lots of barley wines have to them.

Plenty of bourbon against the barleywine backbone. Tons going on here: caramel sweetness, bready, barrel character, boozy warmth. Arguably the best barleywine I've ever tasted; I actually prefer this over KH. Truly unfortunate that I don't have any more of these :(

The flavor seems to follow suit with the nose.  A good up front sweetness with hints of date, dark caramel, dark bread, light wood, and light bourbon.  The alcohol is certainly there, but it dries things out nicely on the back end which is good given the complete lack of carbonation.  Definitely warming on the way down, this one is a sipper.

3038,"2012-06-21",4.5,"Poured into a snifter. 2011 vintage. Big thanks to Urbancaver for hooking me up.

3.5 A: Murky dark brown color. Just a quarter finger of tannish head than falls quickly and leaves very little lacing. Kuhnhenn has little time to worry about their beers asthetics.

5.0 S: Aggressive, complex, yet extremely complementary. Thick, rich caramel and toffee. Huge raisin, tobacco, plum, prune, and date slap the smell receptors silly. Only mildy boozy despite the huge ABV. Bourbon and barrel add more complexity to an already superbly complex base. Leather, light peat, earth, and melon fruits in addition to oak and vanilla from the barrel.

4.5 T: Tastes like the nose, but isnt as aggressive (how could it be, really?). Huge raisin, prune, tobacco, plum and all that jazz. Again the booze is hidden very well. Big sweetness, but nothing out of hand and definitely not Bruery level. Leather, peat, earth, melon, vanilla, oak. Wonderful taste.

4.5 M: Heavy body. Carbonation is on the lower end of acceptable. Rich, palpable thickness without necessarily being overly chewy.

5.0 D: A taste could have also been a 5.0, so Ill add it here. Really wonderful beer. Kuhnhenn are masters at hiding booze while delivering the amount of flavor that you can only get from a huge ABV beer. Not quite as good as BB4D, but damn close.

3038,"2012-03-15",3.3,"From notes.  

The color is a ruby caramel brown with a transparent tan edge.  A small off-white cap leaves only an island after a few moments.

The aroma is sweet, deep, and complex.  Bourbon, caramel, lots of vanilla, and oak.

The flavor unwraps slowly, bringing out new layers as it warms.  Caramel, toffeet, and a bit of bready malt contribute to a sweet front.  There is some oak and vanilla next.  As the sip comes to a close, a bourbon presence really steps up and dominates.  It causes some tingling of the tongue, burn in the back of the throat, and warming of the stomach.  I can handle a strong bourbon presence, but this is almost over the top.  It might get better with some significant age on it.  

Other than that, this is a big-bodied barleywine, with enough booze and intensity to take on the strongest beer aficionado.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Touches of gentle sherry like oxidation, rich sweetness meshes with mellow barrel. Initial is fuller bodied, offering healthy sweetness, toffee and caramel mesh with touches of brown sugar, hazelnuts, toast and biscuits. Barrel and vanilla, decent kicks of spirit come into play.

Thanks to buffalohead for being generous enough to share this on a quiet Saturday evening. After a few lighter styles to warm up the bottle we began to open the heavy stuff. As with many Kuhnhenn beers this one is a big monster that punches you in the face. Thats not t say it is bad however. Rather it is like a rich chocolate cake - instead of hurrying through it is best enjoyed by taking your time and enjoying the experience to the fullest.

Aroma / Appearance - Rosy red like a nice glass of merlot the body is thick even just sitting on the counter. Flat and lifeless it doesnt not seem to have any carbonation at all. The nose was also thick and dense as a flourless chocolate cake. With the smell of alcohol, vanilla beans, caramel, and almonds are the forefront it lingers in the air like the smoke from an extinguished fireplace.

Flavor / Palate - Heavy and chewy it feels less like drinking a bourbon barrel aged beer than a melted candy bar. Vanilla, oak, and the medicinal punch of bourbon are aggressive and warm. Malty with no subtlety at all this is almost as big as they come. The depth is enough that it makes the beer worth finishing though afterwards one feels very full. If you are looking for a beer to cap off a tasting this would do perfectly.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Taste is huge rounded bourbon, rich and sweet malt, raisin/date, and prickly alcohol on the very tail end.  Smooth feel in the mouth and the minimal carbonation does not seem to be an issue with the high ABV and huge flavor profile.  The transition from the bourbon up front to the sweeter barley wine on the finish is smooth.

The flavor is more of the same with chocolate malted milk balls, tons of caramel, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and a little more roasted than the nose would have me believe, and once again, a strong alcohol presence.  The body is full with a sticky texture, light carbonation, and a super long finish with caramel, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and alcohol that warms my belly.

3038,"2011-01-12",3.9,"12 oz. bottle, fresh Winter Solstice 2010 version, 15.1% ABV.  I wanted badly to age this beer, but years of built up anticipation and worries over Kuhnhenns well documented bottling issues forced my hand.  Pouring clear, the body is a deep crimson color, sporting a small, fading head of smooth, fine-bubbled khaki foam.  Some rounded, diagonal flares of lacing jut out from the body, clinging to the glass with moderate intensity.  The nose is deep and complex, layered with seemingly infinite waves of malty intricacies.  Chocolate roast hits first, surprisingly, lending a toasty background to an otherwise sweet blend of varied caramels, toffees, and crystallized fruits.  Baking bread and cake are evident, as are plums, raisins, dates, and toasted, maple sugar glazed nuts.  Bourbon and oaky, rich vanilla run rampant, tempered only by the enormity of the malt base.  Despite all the malty sugars, the nose still manages to come across as boozy, almost hot.  This must have been some potent barrel!  Flavors follow suit, lush and rich, malty for days and days.  Toasty toffee, burnt caramel sugars, and cocoa roast are all turned to eleven, slathered with decadent Kentucky bourbon that seems to have been reduced and just baked into the inner soul of this beer.  Raisin stew, dates, figs, and nuts are all overflowing.  Bourbon is as potent as Ive seen in any beer, yet despite its potency, it actually works in light of the massive malt bill.  Theres just enough roast in this beer to legitimize it in my book.  The palate is big and sugary, drinking downright heavy and slow, almost sludge like.  Light carbonation is appropriate.  Heavy booze dries things out a bit, but some residual stickiness remains.  Damn, this is a polarizing beer.  I hate its heft, and it goes against everything that Ive stood for over the last year, but it is well done and tasty as hell in small doses.  The best way to describe it is as a poor mans Wooden Hell.  Very similar profile, overall.  Good brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

the flavors consisted of caramel, light and dark fruit-raisin and Bourbon aged Dates, bread crust, there was a light earthy floral fragrance, 
this ale had medium bitterness at the finish with a little alcohol heat at the finish (the alcohol gave some bitterness on the palate), there is light fruit citrus on the palate, the alcohol grew a little when it reached room temperature but there was a lot of malt flavors to go along with the alcohol,

Just stopped in to pick up one of the remaining bottles of Fourth Dementia (thanks to all the BAs who pointed this out in the Great Lakes forum), and we were lucky enough to catch the 2009 version of this on tap at the brewery.

7oz pour into a mini snifter.

A: Dark caramel with some closer-to-gold hues. Bronze and a small off-white slash tan head. Moderately transparent, and somewhat of a glow. Minimal lacing.

S: The smell is immediate bourbon. Underneath the bourbon comes a malty balance including caramel, raisins, a bit of dates, hints of vanilla, toffee, and a wee bit of oak. The bourbon was definitely one of the dominant flavors, but didnt quite overpower like it does with the Perfect Storm.

T: Much like the smell, and the complexity really hits you, with each sip revealing more flavors. As the beer warms, the bourbon mellows through, and out comes a bit of malt sweetness, some nice caramelization, toffee, and a bit of woodiness. A touch of spiciness as well.

M: Quite full bodied and the alcohol doesnt come through nearly as much as would be expected from a 14% beer. Nice and chewy throughout.

D: Very, very drinkable. It was quite sad running out of this, and I would absolutely love to get my hands on a bottle to see what a few years does to this one. As it is, Im quite glad we were lucky enough to catch this one in time--props to my parents for deciding to move to MI and give my wife and I an excuse to stop by and try this one out.

T: All of the notes from the nose are here, but the sweetness has mellowed out. Bourbon, oak and vanilla are up front paired with a slight booze blast. Caramel, molasses, brown sugar, raisins, and a hint of citrus. Some earthy/spicy hop bitterness. Well balanced between the booze/malt/hops.

M: Moderate-heavy bodied with near ideal carbonation. Only a slight booze burn (considering the 14.5% ABV, this is impressive). Clean finish, with a bit of bitterness and only a little lingering sweetness. Manages to deliver an incredible amount of sweetness from start to finish but never crosses the line and becomes cloying.

O: Slow drinking, but that should be no surprise. Deliciously complex with a good body = top tier bourbon aged barleywine. Id imagine aging this brew would only improve the balance and help bring out additional layers of flavor.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

2005 pours hazy dark amber with minimal head. 2009 pours hazy medium amber with a minimal head.

Both have an excellent aroma - sweet malt, caramel, toffee, oak, bourbon, and vanilla. More oxidative notes in the 2005 and some leather and sherry.

Both flavors are intense. Sweet caramel and toffee, bourbon, and lots of -bal notes of oak and vanilla. 2005 has some leather, molasses, and sherry oxidation notes as well. More barrel and vanilla too. 2009 has more alcohol, as the 2005 has almost no booze to it.

Just a tad boozy on the palate, less so with the 2005. Medium-bodied and smooth with appropriately low carbonation.

3038,"2010-01-13",4.4,"12oz Bottle. Thanks Sean! An intense fruity nose that brings me back to the essence of Barleywine. Honey-drenched graham cracker, rum-macerated dried figs, and bourbon soaked peaches. Absolutely glowing and delightful. Froths up a thin rim of white. Lying beneath, a murky brew cloaked in henna and amber, fringing golden. Alcoholic bursts forward, taking within a strong mix of malts, fruits, and barrel. Oak, apricots, and oat crackers all tumble out of a brandy bottle, spilling the lugubrious vapors all over my palate. The alcohols really keep this one fresh. I expected sickening sweetness and instead got airy oak-balanced liquid toffee. This beer has a great balance of flavors and none of those rancid characters I might expected from such a beer, such as, bubblegum, early-stage infection, or oxidation. Theres a deep pithiness to the oak that elevates to vanilla and cream. This beer really and truly is an epic barleywine, one that reminds me that I do, in fact, enjoy the style (when done well).

Fruity and boozy and malty and all in a balanced exchange.  Warm and altogether very pleasant; raisins, belgian chocolate, and a general wine-like texture beneath bourbon.

Meaty malts and rich fruit-textured bourbon in the flavor.  The fruit flavors, immediately, are sunny and soft, like summer fruits, not the more expectant vinous and dark pit fruits.  Nectarines, and mangos, particularly.  Beneath these, the vinous fruits swell calmly; raisins, strawberries, and dates.  Chocolate and velvety warmth enfold.  Bitterness mid-palate is in cherry pits and wooden nuttiness.  Bourbon really permeates with a clean, comfortable sweetness that I havent tasted in another bourbon-barrel beer.

Oily and rich full palate; lightly tangy; lively, but thoroughly dense.  A bit of cocoa and more spirit sweetness in the finish, where alcohol is still remarkably laid back.  Pitch-perfect execution of some gorgeously lush textures, and done with the just the right degree of restraint.  Masterful.  Many thanks again, Ken!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Full, impressively dense mouthfeel: soft carbonation; lots of dried dark fruits, caramel, and maple syrup; the bourbon character is soft, toasty, slight vanilla presence, and lots of sweet dried fruits; beautifully aged at this point, with a touch of dried caramel coming through, seeming like oxidation (though light); remarkably drinkable and well-integrated; a touch of sour-mash character from the bourbon, adding a bit of acidity; minimal alcohol, if any, which is pretty sweet for 14.5% beer; I could drink a ton of this, and will likely never get the chance to.  Awesome, perfectly blended stuff.  A touch of smoked meat and smokiness / charred malts.  Long finish: sweet, intricate bourbon, dried dark fruits, and maple syrup; great bourbon barrel aging serving to restrain a previously unhinged barley wine.  This is how barrel aging should go.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Flavor is up front celery,  blood/minerals, sea weed,  booze,  cherry,  foot,  funk.  Finishes boozy,  warming,  some tartness.  I guess even at a stud tasting you get one turd.

3038,"2008-05-27",4.5,"A- Pours a ruddy, brownish hue with little to no head.

S- Smell is absolutely phenomenal. Tons of brown sugar, hints of bourbon, fig.

T- Wow. Before describing the taste my first thought is ... smoooth. Starts off slightly fruity, possibly hints of cherry mixed with figs, brown sugar sweetness comes in to balance. The end is an alcohol warming balanced exquisitly with very sweet, sugary notes.

M- Thick with a good bit of carbonation left for a beer this old.

D- This is another out of the park brew by kuhnhenn. I truly hope they produce more so I have another chance to drink this one. The main thing I truly loved about this one was the balance. It was huge yet seemed to balance the alcohol perfectly with rich sweetness that a lot of other ""extreme brews"" fail to do. Totally lives up to the hype in my opinion. Although there probably arent many bottles left in circulation, if you have a chance trade whatever you can for this one.","California, USA","Lothore"

It didnt disappoint, but it sure as hell was unexpected. Im not sure if one would call this a unique take on a barleywine or just a barleywine gone wrong, but the intensely fruity nature of this beer was totally out of left field. Fruit sweetness was not cloying but still very sticky on the lips. Plum, cherry, molasses, with no bourbon or oak to be found. Throw some pineapple and candy apple in there and youve got this beer. Surprisingly drinkable.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Pours a very dark red, with just a ring and dusting of tan head.  Slick oily mouthfeel, alcohol warming in the back of the throat.    Not anywhere as sweet as the aroma hints at.

3038,"2008-01-04",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2013 Draft special at the solstice party.  Someone said this was the bourbon barrel and then the brandy barrel.  Im not sure.  It could have been both because Id seen old ales and barley wines on bourbon come off a little fruity/sweet like this.  This one smells downright amazing, with a huge red grape and plum and wine-stained oak note along with some bread and peat notes in the nose.  Lots of wood tannins at play, and slightly oxidized.  Very low carbonation, sweet, spicy, velvety, very amazing.  Reminds me of sherry, sour brown ales, red wine, and potpourri.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3038,"2007-12-24",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2008 2006 Barley Wine in bottle.  Clean mahogany hue with a small foamy ring and spotty lace. The aroma has notes of plum, mango and starfruit esters, sweet honey, bready and caramel malts, herbal and resiny hops. Was this dry-hopped or something prior to re-release for it is shockingly hoppier than any of us expected. Besides the hop forward taste I also got tropical fruit, sweet caramel, toffee, mint leaves and a hint of clove on the finish. Warming and biting with a sticky mouth feel, astringent finish. This is really nice and I still wanted to know what is up with the bitterness. Glad I got one bottle for later.  Bourbon barrel: Tasted at the Kuhnhenn Winter Solstice: Deep murky brown with a minimal amount of bubbles but oily upon the glass. The aroma has a big woody and bourbon character with some wet grains, molasses, caramel, and herbal hop vapours. The taste has an oxidized and cardboard tone up front with notes of prune, chocolate, caramel, anise, clove, and plenty of bourbon barrel. The mouth feel is sharp and biting, lush and dry. Seems a bit too long in the barrel IMO.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3038,"2007-12-12",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2009 Rating #1100Purchased at the brewery a few months back. Ive been looking forward to trying this. The aroma can be detected from across the room. There is a great play between dark fruity goodness, sweet caramel, hints of alcohol and woody bourbon-ness. The flavor is a sweet kiss on the lips with figs, dates, minced raisins soaking in molasses and an absolutely delicious river of caramel candy. A pleasant warming sensation does show up around the finish. Competing with the barleywine flavors but a couple notches below in strength is a bourbon and wood sensation. Very nice compliment creating an enjoyable experience. The after taste is a mix of dark fruit, caramel and hints of wood. The only knock I could find would be the body. Its a bit too thin. Sure hope they plan on making more this next winter.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3038,"2007-05-15",4.2,"Bright copper pour. Small off-white head, rapid dissipation, speckled minor lacing. The coloration of the body is a most marvelously captivating shade, invoking memories of travels through Egypt; it looks like melted metal youd find encased in a pharoahs tomb. Raisins mingle with a full, gentle bourbon and vanilla liqueur composite in a soft, well-rounded nose. This shrouds roasted caramel and just a touch of alcohol. A vinous dark fruit quality speaks volumes about the quantities of malts and sugars employed in the brewing process, of their quality as well. It really seems like the ideal marriage of malt and extracted bourbon and barrel character was reached. Flavor is very sweet, woody and whisky enhanced. Is this what bourbon barrel J.W. Lees Harvest Ale might taste like? Ample alcohol provides a strong bitterness that seems as if its a strurdy mold for the other flavors to frolic in. Hops are discernible but dont really make a resounding difference in the whole of the flavor. The finish is delicate and very warming with lingering toasted grains and vanilla. Mouthfeel is light bodied for a beer of this magnitude, medium overall, with high viscosity and very little carbonation fizz.

Aroma is tons of sticky malts, caramel, toasted, tons of sweetness, but not cloying, with a nice rich vanilla oakiness and a very subdued alcohol apparency despite the 14.5%.  Awesome full flavor, of sticky dark toasted malts, lightly nutty with a great balance of wood, and bourbon.  Thick and smoooth palate with a long lingering finish.  Having had the first release of BA old Numbskull only a few days beforehand, Id have to say I liked the Kuhnhenn much better.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3038,"2007-02-12",4.2,"EBF 2007: Pours a light brown with a loose tan head. Aroma, oaky, caramel, vanilla, some molasses, a bit of boozy bourbon. Flavor, Rich caramel, and toffee, some mild bourbon flavors, nothing over powering. There was a bit of heat, but it was welcoming. The perfect beer to start off Saturday after standing in the cold for 30 minutes. Great stuff.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
3038,"2007-02-11",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2008 [Ive had the pleasure of having this beer several more times, and each time it just gets worse - its still good, but the wow moment I had at first just isnt happening anymore - oxidation and booziness have started to become noticeable qualities]  EBF 2007 - this was one of the highlights of the fest for me - there were lots of bourbon-aged beers, but this was one of the few that was done right - dark brownish red with small head of large bubbles (almost looks like its out of the cask) - complex aroma of vanilla, oak, toffee, some fruity esters (cherries), bourbon (though it doesnt dominate) - lots of wet wood and vanilla in the flavor, with subdued notes of whiskey (though not boubon specifically), without being boozy - very heavy and chewy - rather than washing out the barleywine characteristics (heavy caramel and toffee with light fruity esters), the woodiness melts into the background adding a gentle, earthy touch to what Im sure was already an outstanding beer - amazing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3038,"2007-02-09",4.6,"12er.  What nectar.  Dark brown color.  Outstanding aroma.  Astonishingly complex flavor of absorbed wood (coconut, vanilla, soaked wood, light whiskey) and heavy malt (an array of cinnamon covered fruit, caramel and toffee.  Very, very smooth.  If anyone has any bottles of this for trade, I am willing to trade heavily for it.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
3038,"2007-02-07",4.5,"WOW, what a beer!  thanks to Styles for getting the Kuhnhenn Holiday gift pack.  aroma is all about the bourbon with some vanilla and dark fruit.  flavor is a great mix of sweet malts, earthy oak, plums, vanilla, bourbon and some brown sugar.  this is one of those sippin beers that would be easy to gulp down.  yeah, its that smooth.  most other bourbon beers are hot or one dimensional, but this is just smooth and very drinkable.  Kuhnhenns continues to impress and I hope I can get ahold of this one again next year!!!","Quad-Cities, Illinois, USA","barleyPops"
3038,"2007-02-05",4.3,"12oz, big thanks to walleye for this. poured deep ruby with just about no head. nose is impressive with fresh plums, bourbon, sweet chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. flavor has very nice candied dark fruits, caramel, raspberries dipped in chocolate, butterscotch, brown sugar, cotton candy, and just hints of bourbon. mouthfeel is syrupy but not cloying. alcohol does warm a bit but doesnt bite and for a 14.5% its impressive. the bourbon just accents this wonderful bw and adds even more complexity.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3038,"2007-01-21",4.3,"Thanks go out to Chris for the chance to try this beer.  Served in a tulip glass from a 12oz bottle that says 14.5% alc.  Not the 12% the site has it listed at.  Poured very vigorously to try to agitate it and get some sort of head from the beer....but nonetheless it formed a nice caramel dark toffee colored head for all of a couple seconds than falls out very quickly to no head what so ever.  The aroma is VERY good on this brew...lots of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toffee, sweet dark fruits, brandy/bourbon notes with a little bit of oak woodsiness that leads to a small amount of vanilla.  The alcohol is also pretty dominant in the aroma.  On to the flavors...this truly is a sipping beer that could be enjoyed for an hour before finishing the bottle.  The flavor is sweet and thick with lots of molasses, dark brown sugars, a nice amount of vanilla and oak from the barrel comes through in the flavor.  And then is a really warming sensation from the strong alcohol presence melding with the  bourbon barrel.  Overall a really great barleywine that I can only hope to try again.  Thanks Chris!","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
3038,"2007-01-17",4.6,"Pours an opaque dark brown, with deep auburn tones. Almost no head, but somehow it maintains decent lacing throughout the glass. With an aroma full of sweet dark malt, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon, this just may be the best smelling beer ever. Seriously. Although I was very eager to drink it, I really was content just to sit there and sniff it. And every time I did, I just smiled and smiled. And I wasnt even lit. Yet.

The flavor is full of caramel, sweet toffee, bitter oak, vanilla, and a huge raisin presence. And of course, bourbon. The bourbon flavor is oaky and almost cherry like straight into the finish, where it gives way to a straight mild bourbon aftertaste.

Nice full body, gently carbonated, and emminently deceptive in its masking of the alcohol presence. By far the best bourbon beer I have ever had.

This beer is changing the way I think of bourbon barrel beers. Although I do like them, my appreciation for them has always been along the lines of ""interesting, tasty, but lets move on to something else."" I think for the first time I am experiencing the bourbon flavor as such an integral component of the overall character, rather than just a tasty added extra. 

This beer might even teach me to like bourbon. Uh oh","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
3038,"2006-12-25",4.2,"Bottle... This beer rocks!... Almost clear, deep orange ale with crimson highlights and a small, creamy, off-white head. The nose is vinous and fruity. Its a swirl of caramel, port, fig, dried plum, wood and light bourbon. Vinous, woodsy, heavily sweet flavor with notes of caramel, toffee and bourbon. English style barley wine for certain. Faint bitterness. No real alcohol bite. Full-bodied and chewy/syrupy with subtle carbonation. Lengthy, sweet, dark fruit finish with a splash of port. BIG, bold, excellent beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

3038,"2005-02-07",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2007 The Lure:Regal bourbon licorice sticks act as a proud prow to this baccate toffee vessel. Its sails are swollen by sweet cocoa and palm sugar as it glides forward in confirmed smoky fraternity. 

The Festivities:Harmonious berries wade in a wealthy, slick sea of bubblegummy candied malts and bourbon heat. A very fine carbonation allows the flavors to float in synchronicity, as sugary dates, raisins and a peaceful alcohol warming assure a lip-smacking posterity. Alcohol bitterness plays the role of the hops and skillfully diversifies the malt. As inspiring as Alesmiths own barrel-aged ventures, this luxurious barley wine is as velvety as they get. 

Transcendence:An old-world monarch gets comfortable with his preferred libation, forecasting glorious, dominion-shattering decisions.

3038,"2005-02-07",4.1,"Thanks to ClarkVV for sending this one!
Hand bottled from a growler.
Ive been disappointed by several other ""barrel"" beers, but this one was near perfect! 
The pour produced a small fleeting head of off white which I can only imagine was greatly diminished from what it once was. Carbonation was accordingly low, but for this type of beer, I only look for a lower carbonation rate anyway.
Murky dark brown color.
The aroma was a delightful blend of Bourbon soaked cherries ( and I dont care much for Bourbon).
The flavor is sweet from beginning to end with a long finish. Expect fruits, vanilla, Bourbon, all blended with an excellent Barleywine. Perfectly balanced and a very tasty sipper overall.
Excellent!","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
3038,"2005-02-02",4.1,"Whisky barrel aroma is apparent notes of oak, vanilla and bourbon.  Dark opaque brown-amber with fair tan head that recedes to ring with sudsy lacing.  Grapes, raisins, plum fruit flavours some underlying roastiness and a hint of alcohol.  Bourbon barrel aging has done this one well and brings out notes of vanilla and the obvious bourbon flavours.  Fair carbonation with a thick almost syrupy texture and medium-full body.  Sampled at the post-XBF05 gathering with ClarkVV, Eyedrinkale and Rastacouere.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
3038,"2005-01-31",4.1,"Post-EBF at Clarks. Dark brown, decent off-white head. Bold earthiness amidst peaty and meaty malt. Complex salty bourbon hints never justify a 12% ABV. A fruit harvest in every sniff (pumpkin, apricot, grapes, apples...) One of the better balanced big barrel-aged beers Ive had. A slight vegetal peak quickly morphs into a sharp ashes and tobacco oiliness, bringing peaty and smoky finish hints. Tart earthiness all around carries the sweet vanilla notes with skill. Mellow vinous hints, but mostly good rounded malt complexity. Moderately carbonated, slightly liqueur-like texture, medium body. Very satisfying first Kuhnhenn experience.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Color is a muddled mess of black and brown with an amazing aroma of bourbon, vanilla, molasses and ripe and dried dark fruits. First sip is Raisenettes soaked in bourbon.

3038,"2004-11-28",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2006 Going to rerate this beer. Was at the brewery a couple of weeks ago with Artusory, Pailhead, and punkrkr27 sharing some good beers with each other and the Kuhnhenn brothers. When Eric went to the back room and brought this out. This was the best bourbon barrel what ever I have had. It was well balanced the borbon flavor didnt over power the other flavor, It didnt seem like I had a glass of Jack in front of me. I just hope they will make this more often and it could rival the Raspberry Eisbock. Thank you Brett and Eric. This is my second 5 from my favorite brewery. from the tap.poured a dark brown with hints of mahogany around the edges nice tan head. aroma, plums, raisins, toffee, chocolate, malts, hints of wood, cherries, alcohol red wine flavors . flavor, licorice, honey, chocolate, toffee, malts, alcohol a nice blend of sweetness and bitterness. a nice smooth mouth feel. this is a kicken beer.

3038,"2004-11-07",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2011 Bottle:  The aroma consists of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and bourbon.  Its a transparent orangish-brown with a small beige head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the edges of the glass.  The flavor starts with lots of caramel and toffee.  The finish has light-moderate vanilla and light bourbon.  Medium-full bodied with mild carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

3038,"2004-07-28",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2005 2003 vintage sampled July 2004.  This fine brew was about 14 months old when I was given a sample.  It was dry hopped with 3 different types of hops after being removed from the barrel.  I was given a siphon drawn serving right out of the plastic keg that it was dry hopping in.

Pours a deep golden-brown, with some bright yellows and even some light green specks from the dissolving hop pellets.  Head was minimal, anything arising quickly dissipated.

Aroma was divine: earthy and juicy hops mix with caramel, toffee and butter.  A solid aroma stays around while the beer is still in the glass.  Not too overpowering bitter or sweet.  A wonderful mix.

Flavor is moderately sweet, but the addition of dry hops only a few weeks ago serves to drive away a good amount of the sweetness.  The hops are fresh and soily tasting, but no hugely high-alpha hops were used, so it gains a wonderful hoppy flavor, but not overpoweringly bitter.  Some hints of chocolate and touches of toffee linger on the finish.

Mouthfeel is gritty and lightly chewy from the dissolved hops.  There is almost no carbonation in this, just what has naturally arisen.  Body is a touch too loose, but for such a huge beer, it is very delicate and drinkable.

11/04 release  Deep dark brown appearance with a dark brown head.  Notes of hops, caramel, coconut (from the bourbon), raisins, yeast, dark fruits.  Flavor is lightly sweet at the start, with plenty of brown sugar, yeast and dark fruits mixing together (plums, grapes, blackberries).  A bit of sourness in the body, which is medium-full to full.  Smooth palate and plenty, but not too much, bourbon on the finish.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
