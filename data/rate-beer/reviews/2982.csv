2982,"2015-02-26",1.3,"Yup, this one didnt make itdont know what i expected from a two year old malt aged on Jager chips. Pretty much flat, gross, ash water. Just a faint bit of the Jager left. Still awesome concept. Thanks drowland for the share!","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"
2982,"2015-02-22",3.2,"Poured a cloudy yellow from the growler brought by Danny over a year old. Aromas of corn, bread, malt, light herbal spices and some light anise with a touch if oak. Flavors were the same but with some sweat. You know that sweat you taste after some says ""Im going to pump you up"" if you didnt like this one you must be a ""sissy boy"" as well. Thanks Danny for the share.","Florida, USA","burg326"

2982,"2013-07-13",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2013 Rating #5000! 7/13/13. On tap at Green Room for my Jax going away tasting. Walt, poured some out for you, homie. You had an insanely positive impact on the beer world, RateBeer, and so much more. We miss you! Hazy golden pour with a small off-white head. Big oaky vanilla and wood with nice herbal Jager aspects and lingering corny caramel in the aroma. The oak and Jager pops in the flavor as well with lingering black anise and corn and. A perfect representation of this going away party. Thanks Green Room and everyone else for brewing these and thanks everyone for coming to the party!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
