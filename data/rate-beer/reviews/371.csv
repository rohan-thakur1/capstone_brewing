Pours unclear blonde, small white head. Smell is rather intense, and to the dry side. Some funk, and wood. Reminding me of an american sour-like lactic sourness, but in a very smooth way.

To be honest, I love it, and it is weird to me, since I hear mostly negativity about it. Sure, it might not be the sourness you expect in a geuze, but not having a really sour beer, doesnt make it taste bad at all.

371,"2016-05-28",4.0,"New Boon Mono Blend, this one with 90% old lambic from the oldest barrel in the brewery, barrel number 79 - sparks curiosity. Off-white, loose, bubbly head thinning quickly, only loosely retaining on the edge; beautifully warm, almost bay-like, amberish orange blonde robe, initially clear but evidently misty with the sediment added, with lively sparkling as expected from the style. Aroma has all the lambic funkiness you would expect, but in a mellow, noble, restrained, indeed largely old lambic way; hints of crabapple, moldy orange, damp wood, moist cellar, unripe apricot, yellow plum, subtle vanilla-ish oak tannins, stale sweat, sweet pickled gherkin, smelly abbey cheese, chlorine, soft lemony accent. Same mellow old lambic effect in the mouth: lots of unripe stonefruit tartness in the onset, palpable minerals and a lemony accent, sour like gooseberries or green plums: tart and crisp, but not puckering. Sedate lactic sourness rules here, dries the mouth and sharpens the appetite, but there is very little lemony acidity; mouthfeel is supple and smooth, well-carbonated but in a lambrusco-like way and therefore light and agreeably spritzy. Soft barley breadiness and wheat soapiness as in any traditional geuze form a solid backbone upon which increasing woodiness is built, assisting the lactic sourness in drying the mouth cavity and yielding lovely, noble wet wood flavor retronasally. I also recognize a vague chlorine-like effect which I have encountered in a much more outspoken (and, frankly, unpleasant) form in a glass of old Boon lambic I had at the Verzekering Tegen De Grote Dorst last year. An earthy, dim, leafy hop bitterness lingers after swallowing, actually quite outspokenly so; bready, yeasty and malty sweetishness (in the vaguest kind of way) lends juiciness to the finish and, unsurprisingly seen its unusually high ABV, a glow of soft, lightly wodka-like warming alcohol is noticeable too, but otherwise stays quite well hidden. Mellow in its sourness, a bit chlorine-like, much stronger and more bitter than average, this is quite different from the other Boon geuzes and notably different from its VAT 77 predecessor. I prefer geuze with more crispness and vivid acidity, but I like traditional geuze no matter what and this is, though not my favorite even among Boons products, certainly an interesting experiment - and a good way to get acquainted with Boons old lambic character without actually having to drink it.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
