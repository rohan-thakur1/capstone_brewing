Lovely sour ale aroma indeed: sour apricot, sour cherry, sour yoghurt, sherry, passion fruit galore, mouldy orange, wet wood, wet leather, gooseberry, sour cream... Very estery taste, peachy, starfruit, tons of gooseberry and passion fruit, dryingly tart with sweetish side to it providing balance but the drying effect lasts till deep into the finish as it ought to be for any sour beer type; some soft caramelly and bready malt sweetness lurks underneath and provides balance and structure.

I normally rank this among my favorite beers ever, so I bought a few and held on to them. Unfortunately the sourness does not increase much but the Brett does, At 1.5 years old both bottles were dank, musty, and meaty. The Pinot barrel came through stronger on the aroma but the taste was strange. I like Orval so Brett isnt a problem for me, but it clearly kept developing.

1111,"2015-08-18",4.2,"Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. Bottled on 1/16/15 printed on label.

Appearance: Pours an opaque copper-orange with a 1/2 finger bubbly snow white head which dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing.

Smell: Oak barrel and cherries dominate with a touch of barnyard funk and vinegar. There is a hint of sweetness that balances out the sour aroma. Smells amazing.

Taste: The oak characteristic from the barrel is dominant up front with a blast of sour cherries and lacto sourness in the middle before ending with tannic dryness that leaves a very mildly sour and oaky finish. Overall, the flavor is a bit abrasive and not as balanced as I would have liked.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. 

Drinkability: Decent drinkability. This is a one and done beer for me.

1111,"2015-08-05",4.5,"The impetus for this particular rating comes from a 2012 3 Liter graciously shared by Adam C on 7/25/15, though Ive had earlier baches (1-3) and never got around to rating it for whatever reason.What to say about this guy?? Early on I was much more a Temptation guy, as some of the early batches had some diacetyl problems when relatively fresh. I also would take Batch 1 (001 or PH1) Beatification over this, as I think that ones a bit more refined/elegant and I will certainly, though grudgingly, admit that Supplication is prone to HEAVY sourness. That being said, this is a masterfully well done beer, as are all of Vinnies sours and this one, when on is absolutely delicious. Lip puckering acidity from both cherry acids and bacteria hits early and lingers, but theres a strong malt structure and enough residual sweetness to balance.This particular bottle, with 3 years of age on it had considerably softened. Still a good deal of sour yogurt and grapefruit rind, but never gives off any acetone-like flavors I associate with too much sourness. Great mouthfeel/texture, with no astringency problems and a wonderful, authentic tart cherry flavor that does not overpower. Vanilla, oak and funky barnyard linger on with other complex fruit and barrel-driven notes. No alcohol noted in aroma or flavor.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The sour balanced out and isn't overly strong and the grapes from the Pinot barrel clash with the cherries that were added. The mouth feel is a little thin, and the carbonation makes it come off a little too velvety. The aftertaste is lingeringly grape and a hint of cherry. Not too bad,

1111,"2014-12-01",4.4,"Served into a Teku from 010714 bottle of Supplication. As of now, bottle has aged ~ten months.

Aroma -- scents of inviting sour berries and wine barrels emanating from glass. Tough to pinpoint the cherries from the aromatic qualities; however, fruit esters are evident from aroma.

Appearance -- opaque, almost translucent, light brown hue. Little if any sediment in bottom of Teku.

Taste -- phenomenally balanced brew: the lacto and pedio coalesce marvelously w/ the pinot barrels. This brew has a dreamlike sour cherry tartness w/ crisp pinot barrel on the after-tone that leaves your mouth puckering and salivating for another sip. This brew is more sour than sweet, which I appreciate. The cherries in this batch are not as distinct or sweet as the Montmorency cherries--patented by New Glarus Brewing--but, still blend and taste brilliant, nonetheless. Fruit esters and brettanomyces masquerade ABV exceptionally well. 

Palate -- exploring all avenues of your palate, this sweet, sour, and crisp sour leaves your palate as satisfied as ever.

I have been aging this for ten months now. Supplication is a vinous sour that matures exceptionally well over time. Although delicious fresh, the sourness improves and may intensify over time w/o compromising the integrity of the beer. When I get a fresh batch, Ill reconfirm the aforementioned statement.

Strong smell of oak, cherries and musty goodness - little bit like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Knowing it was a sour ale, but not knowing what to expect, the first taste hit my tastebuds and made them all go running with excitement. Its not a ""beer"" and its definitely not a wine. If I classified it, it wouldnt be an ale either - I guess thats why they call it a sour (ale). Tart initial taste, followed by just enough carbonation and a crisp finish (along with some flavors/layers I cant do justice to).

13DEC11 review:
Batch 005x4 - Brewed 2009, bottled May 2010
A: A lovely amber ale pours from the bottle and falls under a finger of taupe foam of fine nature. The foam settles into a solid, thick sheet of the same. Sandy, spotty lace. Excellent clarity. Looks both rustic and inviting. (4.5)
S: What jumps out at me immediately is how much this smells like a Flanders Red now, oak and cherry hues over an apple cider vinegar intonation. Theres a tannic characteristic in the nose as well. Theres a slight grassy funk which is woven into the tart and woody characteristics quite well. Although there is much going on here, I find the nose a little too delicate. (4)
T: Tart with cherries so dominant. I am very, very surprised on how pronounced the cherry is here. It is followed through with oak, dry grapes, and interesting canned spinach flavor. Im noting an umami/leather flavor as well. Complex, intriguing. Theres a bitter undertone that is just bitter enough to impress me to reserve appreciation for the other flavors, but just as I start to get annoyed, it seems fleeting, and I almost seek out the bitterness to help clean the medium of my tongue. The tart aspect of the beer is inhibited by this bitterness in so much as it accentuates the character and marries the other nuances of the beer together. Seriously, this is really, really well blended beer. Impressive. (4.5)
M: Medium bodied and lively foam conspire to a really velvety feel and as this roams my mouth, I think it will dry it out. Upon swallowing and exhaling, my mouth is simply wet and the notes are warmed via alcohol and blossom back through the mouth. Really nice feel here. Im hard pressed to think of what I would change here, cant think of a thing, a hard earned 5 here. (5)
O: I am struggling to think of another beer in this particular style I prefer to this one. I am calling this a Flanders Style, and I am only considering one other in the realm that competes for me: Dissident. And only time will tell if the 11 batch will meet expectations. I really enjoy this beer. And although Im not likely to go out of my way to find it as much, I would likely grab some next time I see it on the shelves. (4)

Batch 005x3 - 09, bottled May 2010
A: Beautiful blood orange color. Light and sandy lemon foam atop ale - two fingers which last for-ev-er. (4.5)
S: The smell of this burst out the bottle as the cork came out. Sour apple, cherry, farm funk, and grain all balance so beautifully I struggle to understand the process of developing this type of complexity in a beer. Goddamn gorgeous. (5)
T: So sour. Deliciously sour. So much going on here, Im not going to waste time trying to articulate. (5)
M: Lovely carb tone with great latitude when gliding over the palate and I get to savor every. last. drop. (4.5)
D: Dont ever NOT drink this beer. (5)

1111,"2013-08-30",4.6,"I poured a 375ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 12/17/12 and cost $18 ($1.42 per ounce). Thanks to Dave S. for picking up this bottle for me in Philadelphia.

Appearance: Brown proper color from a distance, though actually ruby red upon closer inspection. Carbonation can be seen streaming up the side. Forms a small, dirty white, soapy head which fizzles away quickly like a soda and leaves no lacing.

Smell: Pungent red wine scent; dark cherries and a general sour aroma.

Taste: Its kind of ironic that beer snobs love sour beers since they tend to taste like liquid candy to me. Thats okay, because a delicious beer is still my idea of a good beer and a reason why Im rating Russian River Supplication so highly. While the craftsmanship that goes into making this beer is quite impressive, its the actual outcome that I appreciate so much.

This beer starts out as a brown ale and is then aged in pinot noir barrels with sour cherries and a cocktail of yeasts and bacteria are added for fermentation and the souring effect. The result is a luscious, complex palette that has so much going on and its all wonderful. To call this beer sour or tart is an understatement. Any beer can be soured, but its pointless without the right base brew. Though the core brown ale is difficult to distinguish, there are still plenty of individual components that are noticeable. Sweet, confectionery flavors of caramel and toffee come through in the finish. The cherries are present from start to finish - initially tart and sharp, but sweeter and more refined at the end. This palette probably wont be enjoyed by everyone, but those who have the taste for it are in for something really special.

Drinkability: Russian River Supplication is about as far from subtle as you can get. That being said, its no challenge whatsoever to drink. The mouthfeel is thin and crisp, but not spastic or obtuse. Its actually really refreshing while in the mouth and leaves just a hint of cherry in the aftertaste. Nothing cloying here at all. It doesnt seem nearly as strong as its 7.75% ABV weight should be. Theres no alcohol presence or excess body here at all.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

A:  A darker reddish brown with an inch of foamy off-white head. Leaves moderate stains on the glass. Bright and clear with carbonation running throughout the body.

N: Lots of wine grape, vinegar, grapefruit sourness, sour cherries, and rhubarb. Im getting a whisp of the wood and theres a distinctly cheesy funk (think irish cheddar for the saltiness). Has a sour doughiness and a fair amount of wet leather and peppered earth from the pinot noir.

T:  Moderately sour with a touch of vinegar and acid over the top of a light, fruited sweetness. Theres a touch of salt here which I attribute to the vinegar. Does tend to muddle together a bit. 

M: Very well carbonated and its very assertive on the mouthfeel. Medium-light body with no alcohol presence.

O: I really want to like this one more than I do. Its got a lot going for it, but in the RR pantheon, I prefer Consecration, and in the grander scheme, for fair comparisons, Id probably go with a Rodenbach Grand Cru for about half the price.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

375ml bottle thanks to changeup45. WARNING: stout drinkers first sour. Have the pleasure of drinking a batch 4. After popping the cork I got a familiar aroma of red wine. Maybe some barley wine mixed in. Pours a murky brown color into my balloon tulip glass. Keeps a nice steady thin foam island in the glass. Slight lacing. Sip #1. Holy moly this is gross. OK not gross just not expected. ""Give it a chance Art"". I keep telling myself ""Think wine"". Sip #2. Another whiff. Funky aroma. I smell some cherries. Wow is this thing Sour! The taste reminds me of Warheads candies I had as a kid. Maybe a cherry warhead. I wish I had a comparison with a fresh one at this point but Im sure this is a delicious beer to some. No concern that it has gone bad. Let me check back after Ive acclimated a bit..............OK Im back. Im getting used to this. More cherries coming out now. Still super sour. Causing phlegm to build up. Be right back. ...............ok Im still going strong. I hope this is entertaining to some. If you enjoyed this message me and send me some other top 100 sours. Ill do the same. The sourness is tolerable now. I think this is probably how first time IIPA drinkers feel. Im definitely going to revisit and re-rate this one later.

1111,"2013-02-17",4.5,"Bottle from Mill Valley Market..Golden brown with a thin layer of white head that fizzles out nearly immediately. Poured without much yeast, so its fairly clear. Smell is very tart. A good amount of grape/wine in the nose. There is also some sour cherry.  At the first sip, the flavor overwhelms, in a good way. The smell was an indication of what I would find in the taste. Its incredibly tart/sour. Theres a bit of wine and sour cherry or raspberry in it. The Brett comes out hard in the taste. The carbonation compliments the flavor quite well. Theres a lot of effervescence that spreads the flavor throughout my palate.  Overall, this is a remarkable beer.","New York, USA","jrgratz"

1111,"2013-02-17",4.6,"Pours a hazy, dark brownish ruby color with a half finger head that dissipates very slowly and leaves a blanket of lacing. Tons of sediment, but that is expected with the amount of yeast added. Smells of funky, sour cherries, oak, vinegar, grapes, lots of funkiness. Lots of dryness that really does give it a wine-like smell. Smells almost like a cherry warhead. Taste starts with a very astringent, dry, sour cherry flavor, as well as some oak and funkiness. Then get some of the brown ale qualities: slight breadiness, maybe some cocoa (but i could just be imagining that), some carmel malt. Then the astringent sour notes from the brett and bacteria come back even stronger, along with lots more cherry, grape, funkiness, vinegar, oak, some carmel. Extremely dry finish that blends the wine and the beer qualities nicely. So sour, yet extremely balanced. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very lively carbonation from the refermentation that does give it a very champagne-like crisp finish. Very complex and so delicious.

1111,"2012-04-04",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2014 Batch 009. Endless layers of berries and tart fruits in the aroma. The vapors emanating out of the bottle tell beautiful fables of times past, featuring funky Brettanomyces; barnyard; old wood; dried manure; overripe cherries; dust; molten candi sugar; plump, ripe strawberries; a whisper of old leather; and lime. It is magical and it reminds me a lot of my dads farm back when I was a child. But it doesnt stop there: pour it into your glass and youll get fresher esters suggesting something like a sort of local cherry cola, not the multinational kind, but something youd drink out of a clear-glass bottle. Id call it artificial, but I know its only part of the picture. It pours a beautiful, very deep amber. The head, off-tan in color, is fizzy and gets out of your way pretty quickly, with no remnant of it sticking around. The taste is tart and sweet, like ripe berries bathed in lime juice, with accompanying bitterness that feels old and funky. It goes down and greets the stomach with burning sourness. The mouthfeel is medium, somewhat sticky and with carbonation that feels natural and lively. The aftertaste is a bit funky and barnyard-like, but mostly it is fruity, red, and tart.

Supplication pours a deep ruby color, mostly transparent except for the yeast particles floating around. A dollop of beige foam rests on top and laces up the glass nicely.

There is a great balance of sour and funky in the aroma. There is so much going on here. A bit of dark malt, lots of cherries, some lemon, and a nice level of funk, horse blanket and a little stinky cheese.

The brief sweetness in the taste is accompanied by tart cherries, and the flavor grows even more sour as the sip progresses. Tart, more acetic than lactic, and vinegary, totally bold without killing my palate. Each sip waters the mouth just enough to make me want to go back for more. Notes of pinot noir come in toward the end, as if this beer needed any more complexity, along with some spicy oak tannins. The finish has a nice funk to it, giving me an extra smile.

The carbonation starts with a bite but is smooth throughout each sip. A sour puckering sensation causes me to salivate without being overpowering. Lightly vinegary and acidic. A light astringency comes with the barrel but is barely noticeable. The body is on the lighter side of medium. Russian River knows my sour sweet spot.

The aroma was bold and fruity with a dark bread malt and some Brett yeast along with some notes of cherry, oak and a bit of red wine.

The taste was incredibly sweetly tart and very malty with a slight hint of wine in the beginning, then becoming boldly sour with a nice strong malty cherry presence and a hint of oak at the end.

Great retention and lacing throughout the glass.  The color of this one was a murky dark reddish brown color.  As the beer settles, the beer becomes more clear.

With Supplication I was expected a rather sour aroma but instead its toned down a tad bit.  Definitely not their more sour beer.  Instead the cherries come through more with the oak and slight musty funk.  The beer also had some nice wine characteristics from the Pinot Noir. 

Once again I was expected more of a sourness but it held a backseat.  What this taste is though is a very drinkable American Wild Ale.  One that wont make you pucker, but make you enjoy the cherries, the balance of oak and wine like presence.  Its a great mixture of slight sourness, slight tartness, funkiness, cherries, and what the barrel has to offer.  Turns out to be just drinkable and before I knew it, my glass was empty.

1111,"2012-01-31",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2012 ""Thanks to my new friends for sharing this with me! Very exciting to finally have this beer.
Poured into a Riedel Snifter.
A - The appearance is a combo of Gold, Hazel and Amber. Its a very deep woody tone. Two finger head appears but quickly leaves.
S - Pinot Grigio, Cherry and Honey. Im getting that sour bite that lambics provide and a lot of fruits that are all over the place!
T - Raspberry, sour, grapes, cherry. Everything tastes so light with a red-wine finish! Very refreshing! Id love to serve this at room temp on a sunny day! 
M - HUGE bubbles on the swish but light and very easy to drink!
O - I really loved this beer. Would love to have it again.""","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
1111,"2012-01-29",4.4,"375mL bottle purchased at Total Wine in Sacramento.  Batch 008.  Wow, the aroma on this is really impressive with significant amount of tart cherries.  Lightly musty, and quite vinous and tart aroma.  The cherries REALLY stand out in the aroma of those.  Really nice.  Moderately hazy light amber-copper body with a smallish off-white head, that dissipates fairly rapidly.  Starts moderately tart and acidic, but not over the top.  The middle has some more of the sour cherry flavor present.  There is a nice amount of acidity in the middle with good barnyardy funk.  Finishes a little dry with more light tart character.  I dont think there are many other flemish reds out there that could compete with this.  Perhaps the 2007 Rodenbach Vintage, but this is a special beer.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Definitely more on the sour end of the spectrum for these here kind of ales. In a sense, this beer has every aspect I like of wine, but none of those that I  dont. Perhaps the best thing (and perhaps worst) is that it is ridiculously drinkable, the problem with that is that with the price you kind of go through a good amount of bills pretty quickly.

1111,"2011-08-26",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2011 Sour ales are slowly growing on me more and I was very happy to get a chance to try this one. +++Sampled from a 12.68 oz brown corked bottle this beer poured a hazy orange-caramel color with a huge fluffy orange-white head that lingered forever and left some lacing. The aroma was a lovely blend of tart and sour cherries, berries and cider vinegar. The flavor was incredibly tart and sour with strong notes of cherry, berry and cider vinegar and undertones of wood, must, bread and sourdough bread. The finish was long, tart, sour and fruity. Medium body. A bit too tart for my preference but the complexity of flavors was amazing.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
1111,"2011-08-17",4.3,"Served on-tap into a mini pint at TJs 7th Anny. Party. Number two of three in my Russian River flight. An amazing party with amazing beers.

A - Pours dark amber, with a bit of red, with a thin film of head that leaves spotty lacing down the entire glass.

S - The sour hits you immediately but it dissipates quickly allowing you to really appreciate the nuances of this complex beer. The cherries are front and center in this one. Not as tart as temptation but still very pleasant.

T - Tart cherries up front slowly giving way to a oaky, earthy, flavor in the middle. Finish is quite funky with a bit of cherry skin texture. The balance of sour and sweet is nearly perfect. This one is nearly flawless. A great american wild ale.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tart finish lingers on the pallet but not for long. Nice and light on the pallet with a very nice feel.

D - Very High. The cherrie sweetness helps balance the sourness. Perfect balance of tart and sweet. One of the best wilds out there. I cant wait to open my bottle of this.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

I just never gave into the ridiculous prices the local bars were charging to buy and drink this beer in their bar.

In the nose, there is a bold aromatic scent of tart fruit and a woody sour barrel smell similar to Flemish ale.

OK, I like this beer but this is not my favorite sour, not at all. This was sweet and there is a lot of carbonation in the mouth that accents the sour notes.

The flavor follows suit and is based mostly in the soured cherries but the pinot grapes add some signature vinous flavor as well. The soft oak imparts its signature vanilla flavor while the brett really dries things out and lets the other bugs sour things up. The pinot noir barrel lends perfectly with the sour ale base.

Cherries make an appearance towards the finish which gives this beer a lightly sweet flavor.  Fairly lively carbonation, with a slightly prickly mouthfeel.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"
1111,"2011-03-10",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2014 12.68 fl oz brown corked and caged bottle. Batch 005x5.

It pours with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly, then slows down. It doesnt leave a whole lot of lacing. The beer is a plumb skin/passionfruit skin color with a nice bead of orange.

The smell is sweet but tart. It has a ncie fragrance of sour cherries, but also a sugary sweetness. There is so,e lemon rind coming form the yeast as well. The oak isnt that well-pronounced in the smell.

The flavor is at first of sweet cherries, then then it turns to to a dry, lemony pucker. There is a int of funkiness to it but nothing overpowering. Te cherries really shine here, with both sweet cherry flavor and tartness. The oak lingers in the background, accenting the beer just enough. There is an overall hint of mineral water which makes it lighter, but also a bit more blunt with the flavor delivery. I think it lacks a midground between the subtle sweetness and super sour. 

Overall it is a pretty good sour, perhaps overrated, but great for people who love a ton of sourness.

Taste is moderately sour with a strong oak body. Quite vinous and thick with some brett to provide the relatively modest sourness. The sweetness is fruity and carries the whole thing along nicely. There is some tartness, but the underlying oak components sweetens it out. Low carbonation, long duration. A very niec beer, but the harmony between aroma and taste isnt exactly on key.

5.0 A: Hazy orange amber color. Two fingers of cream colored creamy head with pretty good retention and complete coverage of lacing.

4.5 S: Tart cherries from the start. Tannic astringency and oak. Moldy basement, lactic acid, and acetic acid. Lots of crazy funk going on, but balancing wild and tart fruitiness.

4.0 T: Lots of funk again, with emphasis on the brett contributions. Horsey, dank basement, a touch of wet cardboard. Lots of oak again with tannic astringency. The fruitiness is much less apparent in the taste. Some of the tart cherry remains, but not much of the other fruity complexity that is found in the nose.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Carbonation is a bit too aggressive for my liking. Could be creamier. Not bad, but nothing special.

3.5 D: Good, but would prefer some more fruitiness in the taste. Toward the end, the tartness seems empty if that makes any sense.

Batch 05x01.

Dark Persian red that leaves a thorough lace trace of itself, like the indented cushion in a prayer bench. Only here, Im coming to, not going from. 

Decadent nose comprised of dark cherry, fruity vinegar, and woodiness, with a subtle but present balancing vulgarity from the brett and bacteria. Sharp, clean balance of lemon-lime, fermented-through cherry, funk, and fresh, tangy summertime berries. Dry oak finish.

Im not sure why, but Im having a moment with this beer. Brown malt, lactic acid, clean citrus-berry, light tannins, some acetic acid, the brettiness, the abrupt dry finish, like a dramatic anacoluthon in mid-sentence.

Bottle. 375ml. Light amber color with tons of head poured into a wine glass. Sour cherry and vinegar upfront, upon swallowing the bitter taste become more prevalent.

1111,"2010-10-17",3.8,"Pours an opaque amber color.  Thick creamy head. The barrel aging infuse the flavor with wonderful chardonnay tastes and smells.  Cherries are prevalent, with a sour bite.  More like Champagne than beer,  is that possible?","Alpine, California, USA","hamilton23"
1111,"2010-10-10",4.5,"Poured into tulip a hazy yellow-amber with a really nice head and good lacing. Nose of citrus and berries with a hint of wine. Sour taste is immediately present and the good amount of carbonation helps the flavor just explode in your mouth. I knew this was a good beer going in but was blown away by how much I enjoyed this as it is of a style that I have steered away from in the past. The bitter sour astringency tickles the mouth and goes down crisp and clean. I will certainly be having a second go at this one.","Pennsylvania, USA","paulys55"

Cherry, Lemon, crabapple, and watermelon with funky earthiness that just makes you smack your lips in anticipation of more.

1111,"2010-09-23",4.2,"Had this one in three different barrel aging and tasting them next to one another. So nice. Thank you Eclectic22 for providing these beers.
The first 12 mdr/batch 1, next 14 mdr/batch 3, and finaly 15 mdr/ batch 2

The official rating of these beers I have taken from the last and best one.

12mdr/batch 1
Golden orange pour with a hazy glow and a tiny edgy head. The aroma har lots of cherrys in a balanced and low key way, there are some barnyard stuff going on and some notes of strawberries. The taste is pretty bittersweet, with some cherries that seems to have been over the hill and some strawberries. Should I have guesed of the main berry in this one I would have guessed on strawberries. There is a nice touch of wood in the taste. The palate is watery and with a bitter but also pretty anonymous finish.

14 mdr / batch 3
Compared to the first one this has a much higher carbonation level and thus a much finer appearence with a frothy crown on top. It also tends to be more amber coloured. In the aroma I find more oak, some lemon and even more strawberries. The taste is more sour than the first but still rather singleminded without much complexity. The finish is longer and more sour still im missing a bit thicker palate.

15 mdr / batch 2
The pour is still getting darker which is pretty natural due to the longer barrel-aging. In the aroma the cherrys tends to balance way better with the wodden notes than the case is in the previous two bottles. Its is now not only sour but has a fine sweetness. The taste is very balanced and the berries gets way more in focus. Its more sweet and with a palate that tickles your mouth with a certain acidic feeling. The mouthfeel is less watery compared to the other two bottles. Very good beer. Thx","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"
1111,"2010-09-22",3.8,"small bottle.  Pours muddy red brown with persistent, fizzy beige head.  Tart aroma of sour cherries, a subtle breadyness, and pinot noir is also definitely noticeable.  Notes of raspberry and brown sugar also on the nose.  Flavor delivers a blast of tart cherries, which I must say is quite dominating, although pinot noir surfaces very subtly on the finish.  It is certainly very sour and tart, yet still elegantly drinkable.  However, the overall entertainment this beer provides is comparable to other beers 1/3 of the price, although I understand alot went into creating this.  Still very glad I tried this, and i would recommend it.","Denver, Colorado, USA","tennessejed420"
1111,"2010-09-21",3.7,"Bottle (2009). Deep brown with red streaks - pretty beer in my RR ""-tion glass. Nose is musty wood and sweet cherry candy, with the wild yeasts floating around. First sip - as Ive come to expect with RRs sours is completely puckeringly sour vinegar and cherries. The rest of the bottle maintains the sourness @ good levels, which complement the sweetness of the cherries and vinous acidity, though the fruit could be a littl more evident, IMO. All in all a nice beer that I want to drink again, so there you go.","Littleton, Colorado, USA","alagnak"

Its not mouth-puckeringly sour, though, which makes it so easy to drink.  Its definitely one of the most amazing brews Ive had.","Davis, California, USA","mu11igan"

1111,"2010-09-10",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2010 On tap, this brown ale pours an amber reddish color with a bubbly tan head. The aroma is the spontanous yeast smell of the strains used with notes of sweetness from the cherries pleasantly overall rounding it out. There are banana notes as well. The flavor of a Flemish sour brown but with a lighter body is what I taste. The cherry notes, although not sweet, come in smoothly and settle well on the palate with just the right amount of tart to complement it.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

Medium body, oily texture, and a very long, dry finish. Its not too sweet but has a lot of acidity following the attack.

Overall, this is one of the sourest beers Ive had and one of the best sours.  Its very nice - the sweet cherries help balance the sourness and make it interesting.

On the first sip, the flavor is strongly sour, and not a lot else. After a few sips, though, this beers complexity really shines through. It begins with a tart attack, then evolves into big bretty flavor with a sort of hovering cherry note. Dry as a fuckin bone, especially at the finish. I almost feel like this beer is as much about the dryness as the sourness, and theres certainly a multiplicative effect that makes the whole experience like a big punch in the mouth - a very enjoyable one, though.

Excellent mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. This is a beer I keep searching for cheaper and less expensive substitutes for. Truly amazing. Im glad I stocked up with plenty in the cellar!
Batch 5x003 (8/1/10): Opened a bottle after the cork looked like it wanted to really shoot off. Only the cage was holding this together. Poured a hazy, rust color with a nice fluffy head.

Aroma: The nose of this one is full of funky/sour cherries, with some wine notes, and some booze

Appearance: It pours a quite hazy caramel-red color with a fluffy beige head that leaves lots of lace on the glass

Flavor: The taste also has quite a bit of tart cherry, a touch of mild sweetness, and some yeast flavors too

Palate: Its medium-full bodied, theres something very wine-like about the body, and theres a slightly boozy feel

Overall Impression: 
This one is quite sour.  It almost makes the mouth pucker, but it does so while still providing a nice flavorful drink.  As I watch the end of Jack Bauers run as the greatest bad ass in the history of television, I drink this wonderful beer.  Something so sour serves as a reminder that we all soured on this show a bit over the last few years, but well still miss it.  It was exceptional at one point.  Just like this beer, it is was special at one time.  A great beer celebrates the final hours of a great show. Tick, tick, tick, tick...","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

1111,"2010-04-26",4.2,"Batch 003. 375 ml poured into my snifter. I am consuming this as I review it.

A- Body is a very hazy IPA-like amber hue. Pours with a nice, bubbly 1-2 finger head that immediately subsides to a thick collar and has great retention from there. Cloudiness is thick and mostly uniform with some dynamic yeast sediment floating around at the bottom.

S-The first thing that comes to the nose is slightly sour with a big accent on vinegar but a slightly acidic sourness as well. Behind this is sweet orange, exotic fruit, and a hint of cherry as well as a hint of vanilla and oak.

T- Slightly salty flavor upfront accompanied by a slight vinegar sourness. Behind this is some oak and a slight presence of exotic fruit but the cherry is a bit hard to detect. More oak and perhaps cherry pits come through for the finish as the initial sourness and saltiness wears off. What lingers is the remnants of oak and cherry flavors as well as a slight acidic bitterness.

P-High tingly carbonation and medium weight body. Body is not crass but does have a slightly acidic tone to it.

O- This is another great sour from RR. Not as good as their other sours that I have tried, IMO...but still a very very good sour. This one has a bit more of a vinegar presence than the others but is still a very good, well done beer. I am looking forward to Consecration and their other beers that I have not tried yet.

First drop hits the tongue and is lightly sour with a strong cherry presence, extremely creamy mouthfeel, perhaps the best Ive ever tried in this department. On the back end, the beer has a notched up sourness, perhaps an 7/10 if 10 were Old Growth, and some slight oak notes to accentuate the sour cherries.  A bit like a high quality vinegar.

1111,"2010-04-02",4.1,"375ml Bottle. Batch 04X2.  Respectable pop with a heavy layer of slowly rising CO2.  Has a medium orange color with a quarter inch layer of fizz.  Nose is dry with hints of cherries, wood and musty Brett funk.  Flavor is almost sweet upfront with delicate cherry notes that are quickly overwhelmed by a tart vinegar character.  The sourness is drool inspiring and lingers in the roof of your mouth.  Carbonation is lively and stronger than most Ive had in this style.  Body is thin and showcases the sour aspects from the Lacto and Pedio additions.  Ends on a long dry sour note that leaves you craving the next sip.  Definitely a world class sour and one of my favorites from Russian River.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"
1111,"2010-04-02",4.5,"Pours a brownish amber with some haze, and beautiful white head that rose with little effort on the pour.  Nose has a fruit dessert-like aroma with a little lime.  On the palate theres plenty of vinegary passion fruit, sweet malt, wile sour flavors, and a tangy sweet fruity finish.  Incredibly easy drinking for the style, and no unpleasant aspects of the barnyard-ish character.","Glendale, Arizona, USA","yemenmocha"

Pours a cloudy orange with a very nice nose buttered waffles, oak, spices, almost whiskey barrel notes instead of wine barrels.

(Batch 4 - 3/22/2010)ReRate: Batch 4 courtesy of ajm. Pours a cloudy blood orange with a towering, rocky, tan head that leaves insane lacing. Aroma of cotton candy, lacto, sour cherries, baked cherry pie. Im still not too keen on the taste here. The body is thin and spritzy. And there is a massive oak dryness, tannin, leather quality that distracts from the cherry and sour elements.

Complex earthy notes in the form of leather and wood.  The sour essence is dead-nuts on with the brett and lacto blending their products with the berry, the wood and wine and various tannin and everything else that embodies the essence of sour and tart.

1111,"2010-03-12",4.2,"12.68 oz. 3x4 or 4x3 (cant remember which one) bottle from City Beer in San Francisco. Finally, I get to try this! Nice light brown color with an orange hue. Fluffy slightly tan head. Looks like it is going to be a great sour. I like the look of Consecration a bit better (it was a little darker). Nice PUNGENT sour aroma with cherries. Cherry sour aroma cuts through with an insane and amazing brett aroma that is unlike anything I have smelled before. Nice subtle wood backing. Again, I feel the Consecration had more wood characteristics, but this is still amazing. Nice wood backing, brett, sour, and cherries. Just a very wonderful smelling sour. Wow, this smells more sour than it actually is. The sour flavor is not incisive, but extremely mellow (in my opinion). The cherries creep up and hit the taste buds, and the mellow brett mixes quite well with the cherries. The wood is also mellow and mixes well with the afore mentioned flavors. The sour cherry flavor is perfect; it doesnt have an artificial, medicinal, or off-putting characteristic to it (as some beers made with cherries can have). Very nice sour, and extremely happy to have tried. I like this, but I must say Consecration has a slight edge over this one.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Other notable characteristics are freshly cut red and green apples, oak, wine cork, pear, dark cola, spices, notably ground ginger, and damp basement. I can go on and on with the nose. Acidic mouthfeel but also has a woody backbone. Flavors of sour cherry and lemon meat. One of the earlier ratings mention past prime orange juice and I can definitely see that.

Upon sipping, the acidity hits you up front, then subsides just long enough to let you perceive layers of rich citrus-berry flavors devoid of any true sweetness. Then the acidity returns, beautifully.  The barrel-aging is complex, deepening the flavors in subtle ways rather than adding much weighty wood-barrel flavor (vanilla, oak, charred, etc).  I found myself enjoying this one as a lighter-bodied sour.  Besides the obvious acidity, Supplication does not present the intensity of flavor of Consecration, nor LAs Cuvee de Tomme.

The aroma is very evident upon un-corking, filling the immediate space with funk and fruit. Huge funk and wood are pervasive in my sensory experience, while cherries and vinous notes offer a powerful balance. Nectar fruit and a nice lactic quality round out the subtleties. The flavor is out of this world in terms of balance and flavor quality. The fruit arrangement is amazingly unique and works perfectly here: fresh grapes, tart cherry, nectarine, apricot, and further nectar-fruit incarnations prevail. The funk character is quite amazing- farm, lacto, oak tannins, leather, and horse taint just make me smile and go in for another sip. The palate is full, frothy, pillowy, and nicely sitting, while the finish is perfectly puckering and dry. An amazing quaff indeed- one of my favorites from Russian River.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
1111,"2010-02-22",4.3,"Dark copper pour with a beautiful gradation of light to dark. This draws the eye upwards to a very tight and frothy head that simply will not dissipate, and looks almost like a cappuccino. Aroma is robust and full, with lots of funk, wood, red wine, cherry, and lactic notes. The vinous and woody qualities really create a delicate and beautiful balance with the sour funk and more aggressive fruity aspects on the nose.  My first impression of the flavor is an incredible balance for a sour ale. The tart cherry and barnyard funk is totally evident, but the wine, wood, and sweet nectar fruit create an impressively full and flavorful musculature that surrounds this beers skeleton of sourness. The result is a very impressive body of work by Russian River. Palate is excellent; with full body and a smooth massaging characteristic on the tongue. The funk is not overly aggressive, and this brew slides down exceptionally easily. Truly a treat.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
1111,"2010-02-21",4.5,"Pours deep red with huge white head, with lots of carbonation and lasting lace in the glass.  Aroma is full of pinot spiciness, oak, and lots of tart cherries.  A huge complex taste up front is pinot, oak, leading into some mocha and vanilla tastes before the tart cherries blast your tastebuds with mouth puckering sour that ends a bit dry and leaves you wanting more.  Excellent brew, best sour Ive had!","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1111,"2010-02-20",4.2,"Batch 04X5.  The pour is an effervescent, clear, crimson-amber color with a fizzy, creamy, rocky, very full, off-white head which continues to grow, lasts throughout, and leaves sparse but drippy lace.  The nose is interesting with sour cherries, spicy oak notes, wet earth, some funky mushroom notes, some raisins and toffee poking through, maybe some mocha and red currant.  The flavor is even better with a nice balance of sweet, tart, funk, and complexity; the cherry notes and the brett create a nice tartness without being overly sour, some sweet raisins, brown sugar, bretty funkiness, similar earthy tones and spicy Pinot notes work well together, toasted oak, and hints of mushrooms.  The palate is nice with a tart quenching mouthfeel, a medium body, and nearly lively carbonation.  It finishes with some wet oak and Pinot spice adding just a bit of bitterness to match some sweet mocha and lingering cherry tartness making its full presence.  A very nice sour from a great brewery.  Somehow finds a nearly puckering tartness in the finish but keeps all the complexity through the flavor progression.  The brown ale has been altered a great deal but hints of the base beer still show through.  An interesting combination of characteristics in this one but RR always seems to make it work, well.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Aroma is generally somewhat muted with subtile notes of funk, vanilla, light lemon, wood and perhaps just a touch of the cherries. Flavor is delivering way more than expected based on the aroma, just an exploation of woody notes and sweet nectar, sweet cherries, vanilla and light chocolate followed by an amazing sour finish that really stretches the flavors out to every corner of your mouth with sour and almost kind of meaty cherries, lemons, funk and fresh vanilla.

Sour cherry, light oak, and spice aroma. Nice mouthfeel with even, light carbonation. Classic Belgian sour flavors of earth, hay, sour fruit, and the nice subtle addition of winey oak.

Appearance:  Pours an clear amber/copper with a dense fizzy white cap of film. Within the clear body, you can see plenty of visible rising bubbles. The beer leaves behind spotty lace.

Aroma:  Fresh cut red apple, wine barrel, wine cork, musty basement and pear.

Taste:  Both wood and acid duke it out on my tongue for the first big bold flavor to hit my mouth. As it settles, the sourness outlasts the woody notes.  Im amazed that between the wood and the sour notes, this beer doesnt not seem very tanic or astringent to my tongue.  I can pick out lemon and sour cherry for the fruits, and my imagination takes me to  past prime orange juice

T: The taste is even better than the nose (and thats a difficult task). Wonderful sour cherry flavor, lots of lactic acid, and a mild funkiness. There is also a nice tannic component contributed by the barrels and (presumably) the cherries.

M: The carbonation is very light, but works well for this beer. The mouthfeel is quite slick and the body is medium.

This is probably my favorite of their normal sour rotation.  It is a rust-colored beer with a big, white, small-bubbled head.  The aroma is a symphony of cherries, oak, brett, fruity malt, old leather, apricots, plums and grass.  The flavor is tart and dry but smooth, pulling in the wide array of flavor to a wonderful harmony.  The flavors in Supplication are a tad more balanced against each other than most RR sours (no complaints about any of them, though) without any particular flavor dominating.

Poured from 375ml bottle into Duvel tulip.
A nice ""pop"" once the cork came off...a nice sound. ;-)

A - Pours a burnt orange with a white fizzy head. Bubbles linger on top and around the edge of the glass. Carbonation continues to rise up from the bottle of the glass to the top. Some lacing, but the head isnt all that sticky, which doesnt bother me at all.

S - A wonderful fruity tart smell immediately hits the nose. Lots of oranges, apples, mangos, pineapple mixed with some wonderful sour cherries, lemons, and limes. A fruit explosion, you could say. There isnt an overpowering of either, a perfect match, which is something I look for in an American Wild Ale. Too much of one or the other takes away from the beer - this is a perfect balance.

T - Nice and tart/sour right off the bat but not much sweetness at all, which is surprising because of the nose. I also get some oak/wood flavors. A dry finish, much like champagne. The aftertaste is where I get some fruity sweetness - very nice. Really enjoyable, just what I was looking for when I opened this bottle.

M - Very nice and rich, although light in body. Nice fizzy carbonation which matches perfectly with the style. Im enjoying this one much like a glass of fine champagne, probably even more.

1111,"2009-08-04",4.5,"She poured from her majestic shapely bottle into my chalice with grace and aplomb. Soft hazy brown with a demure head of scattered bubbles that seem far more comfortable lazing about the sides of my glass. She swirls with no lace, but in doing so I release a gorgeous beast of a nose that threatens to swallow me whole, not that I am complaining. She is beautiful. Sour cherries with pits included and bright, tart, freshly harvested cranberries dance in a forest of earth, wood, and bark while a wisp of lavender floats in the breeze. More earthen tones of leather and saddlebags ground her tart cherry and cranberry presence. Wow. Did I mention she was beautiful? I am wholly at her mercy, and as she invites me into her precious depths, I willfully oblige. Mouth-puckering, lip-curling, tastebud tingling tart and sour delights explode in a cacophony of flavors. Crisp, crunchy sour cherries with their skins adding some extra acidity while her pits add dry earthen notes. Light in body, she only leaves a thin film of sour esters while cranberries, bright and juicy and tart step up to the plate. Ever bitten into a perfectly picked cranberry fresh from a farmers market? Acting as back-up, soft moisture absorbing wood and leather help to mellow her palate so that the sourness isnt overwhelming. A tingle lingers on the tip of my tongue while lavender and cherries tinge my breath. For all her rich, tart, woodsy, and leathery complexity, her palate is overall rather delicate, subtle, and intricately woven so that each taste experience melds perfectly into the next. I make sure to savor my last sip before I take more than a few minutes to revel in the moment.


If greatness could be bottled, the Russian River Supplication Brown ale aged in Oak Barrels for 15 months with cherries added would be it. Nuff said. No questions asked. Taste and you will know.

Flavor:  Acidic; tart cranberry with cherry balsamic vinegar notes that give way to softer and slightly sweet caramelized malts; dry, oak woodiness and some funkiness is threaded throughout.  Palate:  Medium-bodied with prickly carbonation.  Overall:  Quite excellent and extremely easy to drink; even my wife says ""its good"" and that is a big deal coming from her!

The nose is delicately funky and cheesey with sour cherries and barnyard. The flavour is immediately WAY more acetic than the nose suggests, with ultra-sharp acetic acid, lemon zest, puckering tart red cherry, oak, lactic acid and a whisper of vinous malty notes. It is plenty tart, as I can feel the burn in my chest, and Im not one to get heartburn. I love the lacto that is ever-present in this brew. The aftertaste is oaky, more citric than tart, and bone dry with medium duration.

The taste explodes with sourness up front that seems to be tart berry fruitiness moving into dry tart crushed aspirin sucking the life out of my palate. Midway notes of sugar, sweet berry fruitiness and just a flash of malts create an all too brief and faint oasis away from the searing tartness. It ends tart and dry.

Effervescent mouthfeel gives it a light feel. Mouth-puckering tartness right away. Lemony citric bite along with the bretty funk. A vinuous tanginess follows as does the oak and cherry flavors. Definitely a success in terms of aging in that it tones down the sometimes harsh vinegar and cheese flavors. They are present, but in far less degree so the quality of the beer itself comes through.

1111,"2009-01-10",4.6,"375ml batch 003 thanks to DRINKNDRIVE thanks man. I took the cage off this sucker and admired the label, bad idea. The cork blasted out of the bottle with a fury and I was scrambling for my snifter as this precious beer began spraying my kitchen counter... The label says this is a brown ale but it sure looks orange to me. The smell leads me to believe this will be very sour. I can smell some oaky-woodiness and a wine like smell but not really any funk or must. The first sip I took was very meager and still exploded in my mouth hitting one side of my jaw with sourness and then leaving a cherry note. The smell keeps drawing me back with an interesting note they makes me think I have either had this beer before (GABF?) or it is very similar to another sour? This beer also coats the mouth very well, despite the tiny carbonation bubbles, which leaves a flavor that seems to evolve after you swallow. The flavor also reminds me of sour candies, lime pixie sticks (do those exist?). This is an excellent beer and perfect for those who enjoy sours because this is a serious mouth puckering beer.

1111,"2009-01-09",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2009 Bottle, shared with CaryTheDude and JakeBra, who hooked me up big time with this one. Pours a dark orange with a fizzy head. Aroma is dusty, funky, with wood, cherries, citrus. Flavor is a rush of sour cherries, deep sourness, citrus. Incredible flavor. JakeBra says its like ""a really good warhead"" and I agree. Mouthfeel is wonderful, bringing a rush of saliva. Incredible experience. Thanks, Dude and JakeBra!.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"

1111,"2009-01-07",4.2,"375 ml corked bottle. A cloudy dark golden/orange beer with a quite big and persistent white head. The nose is complex and attractive, acidic and maltier than expected, surely yeasty with notes of wood, earth, cherries, some lemon. Like in beatification the oak is perfectly integrated. The flavour has a medium sweetness and a high acidity. Some wine like feelings. Citric but less than Beatification and with a more round and consistent body. Cherries sre detectable in mouth too. Medium body, lively carbonation, long finish with light to medium bitterness. Again a great beer, amazing aroma and great flavours balance. Im happy to have tasted such a rare beer. Complex and complete.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

Also has a notable tan head, which suprised me for the amount of time this has been in a barrel.  Mild in aroma and flavor for a sour.  Features the unique taste of Rainier cherries.

1111,"2008-12-28",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2009 Bottle from nbutler11s SS haul.  Beautiful color of ruby red and gold with a white head that starts full and fades.  Aroma of sweet sourdough and burning cherry.  Flavor is very much like a kriek at the outset, with a nicely balanced cherry presence.  Wood only comes through as balance not as flavor.  I detected no Pinot here from start to finish.  As it warms, turns very decidedly to Bing and Rainier cherry flavors.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

You do not want to take a swig of this, but it is so good.  There is a really nice oakiness in addition to all of the lemon and cherry tartness.  It is probably the only thing that keeps it balanced in any sense, but it is delicious regardless.  Definitely waters your palate and finishes with a nice pucker.

1111,"2008-11-30",4.2,"Batch 003 bottle poured into a tulip.

Pours a slightly hazy brownish amber with a bubbly off-white head that remains a cap throughout and leaves very good lacing.

The aroma is wonderfully complex with sour red cherries on a big bready malt base with hints of citrus, lemons especially.  The wood character is evident as well and hints of funk as well, but not overpowering.

The taste is just as nice with a lip-puckering sour kick up front with cherries and bits of lemony funk.  The background malts really support the sourness well and the finish is nice and dry with lots of wood and vanilla.  The brett kicks it up a notch in the taste and makes the taste very nice all the way around.

The mouthfeel has clearly been influenced by the barrels as it is dry and wine-like in the finish.  It’s still nice and creamy with strong carbonation though.

This is a fantastic example of a style that I’m really not into.  It says a lot that I really enjoyed this one despite my palate not quite being ready for sours yet.  Get some now.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Ruddy reddish color with smal tight carbonation. Aroma is sour, with Brett characters dominating, with undertones of vanilla oak notes. Mouthfeel is sharp and lively. Sour hits upfront, but finishes with an almost sweetness from what may me the oak. Cherry not really a dominant note, but merely helps accentuate the tartness of the bacterias and the tart fruit from th oak. A very fine brew.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TwoDudes"

Loads of peach/cherry in the nose, some citrus, really slight must, some lactic notes, faintly sweet, vinous notes with warmth. What!? 10/10. Flavor is a step down but is still great: more orange citrus to couple with the peach, lactic notes and wine lingering on the tongue, slight wood hiding out again.

The aroma was very reminiscent of Oerbier Reserva, though a little less complex.  Flavor was initially a burst of bretty tartness, with lemons and of course sour cherries.  Nice lively yeast, really satisfying.  Kind of thin on the mouth.  Ultimately I left myself comparing this to the Oerbier, and the Oerbier really comes out on top on all counts.  This is good and very well-made, but it felt a bit too simplistic, thin, and uninteresting to warrant the hype.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

1111,"2008-09-08",3.0,"375 ml bottle, from Whole Foods in Berkeley.  Okay, maybe I just need to stop rating beer, or maybe I just need to admit that my tastes have changed, or maybe I’ve somehow now become a beer troglodyte...  I have to say it, I don’t like the taste of this beer very much.  Can I appreciate the slightly hazy topaz color and the smallish white head that leaves a trace of lacing?  Yes, I can. Can I acknowledge the craftsmanship that obviously went into producing this beer with the curious aroma of sour fruits, wet wool, tannic oak, with vinuous notes and wet moss?  Yes, I can.  Can I recognize the amount of time and effort that it took to create an ale with this character of sour, puckering berries, dry funky fruitiness, wet wood, pie cherries and funk?  Yes I can, it’s a well crafted, beautifully handled and uniquely flavored beer.  I don’t like it very well at all - too sour, too funky, and overly tart.  This beer is a chore to drink, not a joy.  So let me not rank any longer among the elite of the beer world, ’cause I don’t want to have to wince, blanch and work so hard at drinking my favorite beverage.

The mouthfeel is crisp and creamy with a sharp cleansing character. The flavor has a powerful, Lambic-like acidity, as well as vast funkiness of cork, dried oak, sharp rind-like sourness, and a subtle almond note comes through under all the complex dryness.

1111,"2008-08-09",3.7,"Poured from the bottle into a goblet. Pours a clearish orangy-brown color with a think wispy white head. Lots of champagne type bubbles that fade quickly. I don’t know if i have ever seen a color like this before, either.
WHOA- the smell is pungent. As soon as I open the beer you can get a whiff from across the room. I get a lot of vinegar, some musty red wine, some alcohol and the barnyard as well on the nose. Smell is consistenty strong throughout.
Tast is similar. I get the huge pucker of the sour cherries, vinegar etc. right up front. Aftertaste mellows it quite a bit and makes it even more enjoyable. Bit of alcohol on the end.
Nice champagne fizz on the mouthfeel.
Fairly drinkable for the style- has a lot going on throughout the beer and my mouth is pretty puckered after this one.","weymouth, Massachusetts, USA","DrDogbeer"

This beer carries a much strong sour aroma than the previous batches.  I like it a lot.  Light brownish almost orange color with a nice tingling carbonation that permiates the mouth.  Very balanced beer with the hops only adding to bitterness.  The superb dryness of the beer makes it incredibly digestible and nearly refreshing.  I absolutely love this beer.

1111,"2008-07-27",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2010 Rating number 500!   375ml bottle, batch 3, at the Trappist in Oakland.   Crystal clear amber-orange with a beige head.   Sour lemon, white wine and subtle sour cherry aroma.   The flavor is quite dry and sour, mostly citric sour, with a hint of vinegar.   The cherries are quite subtle, but being sour cherries, they can be expected to blend in with the overall tartness of the beer, I guess.   Light bodied and highly carbonated, with a dry, puckering finish.   This is definitely my kind of sour, with emphasis on a fruity sourness.   The complexities of the wine and cherry flavors are really nice.   Props to the Trappist for serving this perfectly in a couple RR chalices. (8,4,9,4,18=43)  Rerate: batch 4 on tap at the brewpub.   All I can say is WOW.   The cherry is so much more vivid than I remember from batch 3, with more body and acidity as well.   A touch acetic, but dry enough to pull it off.   Great balance between the fruit, malt, and acidity.   Vinnie really nailed it on this batch.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Aroma of cherries, sour, banana, spices, pepper and cassis. Taste is very sour at first with a really long tart cherry aftertaste. Slightly sweet in the middle, but the taste does not have nearly as much characters of the Pinot as I was expecting or wanting (compared to the Amazing Grace that I had at the Abbey). Light and a bit fizzy. Alcohol is well hidden. 9,4,7,4,15,3.9  Rerate: Batch 3.  Pours pretty with a hazy orange body with great lacing and a huge white head that stays.

The aroma definitely betrays the pinot noir barrels-- plenty of berry and oak notes, as well as a rich vinous character; there are also wafts of lactic sourness and a touch of earth. Taking a sip, the sour acidity is much more apparent. It cuts through a mild cherry flavor with some oaky notes and some distant hints of fleshy fruits.

Batch 002 
Pours a hazy reddish-brown color with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smell is very tart, there are aromas of cherries, but there isn’t a whole lot to them, predominant smells of sour and funk. This is not as sour as some other beers of this style, but that’s not the goal, the goal is to create a damn good brew and I would say mission accomplished. There are sour cherries in the taste as well, but it’s more of a vinegar-like sourness mixed with some oak and some grapes. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and had medium levels of carbonation, finish was dry. Extremely drinkable, I would have plenty of this often if I were given the chance.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

In the mouth this is extremely sour and acidic with the tart cherries being the domminate flavor and a tannic grip on the finish.

An incredible combination of bretty sourness, lovely lovely hoppage, utterly amazing cherry and strawberry fruity notes, barnyardy and barrelly (such gorgeous Russian River wooden notes), red wine vinegar, candi sugar and slightly balsamic. Damn I could go on for days. Such complexity but all in 100% perfect balance. An utterly outstanding smell.Well spank my arse and call me Gertrude if this isnt one of the best tasting beers of all time: F**KING HELL this is special. All that is glorious about the aroma is present in equal abundance but the cherry comes right to the front. The bretty notes are huge. The sandalwood / sourness mix is beyond description. There are sherbert sweets being catapulted at you at high velocity giving it a show stopping blend of dry and juicy. My whole palate is covered initially with audacious sourness which is washed away with wave upon wave of cherry, wood and citrus. This is one of those beers that sends you on a journey with each sip and you just dont want it to end. i really dont think I have had a better balanced beer. There is such an astonishing amount happening but its all in perfect harmony. The finish is nothing short of sublime. The immediate tart sourness almost stings and as it departs it leaves gobsmacking cherry, strawberry and just a hint of vanilla in its wake. It lingers for a considerable time and Im very thankful of that. I just dont want it to be over.Dancing all over my palate: This is up there with the very best. Dry, juicy and such width to the flavour with a glorious sting at the sides. Two minutes after writing I can lick around at my gums and still more magnificently tart cherries appear.

As high as its average score is, I still think it is under-rated. You know those moments where you are in a stonkingly good mood and the beer you choose just hits the spot in a magnificent way? It was like that but better. The ridiculousness of all this is, while drinking it we had a look at the RR website. Apparently at the very moment I was supping this goddess of a beer it was possible to get a pint of it during happy hour for $2.75. Thats beyond crazy. Id be doing cartwheels!

Slightly fuller body than the airy fruitiness might originally suggest with the alcohol sidling in near the end.  A great effort; an excellent achievement.

375ml bottle sampled 03/08/09 with about a year of bottle age.  Happy birthday Amy.  Aroma posesses more animal characteristics and additional tartness for a greater overall complexity.

Overall this is not a punch you in the mouth sour like some of the other sours out there.  Its more subtle.  Its more drinkable.

I like to say sometimes that things smell creamy but its hard to describe what exactly creamy means in terms of aroma.  It all just comes together really well perhaps is another way of saying it.  Taste - wow - mouth-puckeringly sour, first hits the tip of your tongue and then moves on back and you feel the muscles of your face squinching together way back around the jaws hinge.  The aroma reminded me of Jolly Pumpkin so I guess I was not expecting the sour shock, unlike anything else Ive ever had.  I love sour beers and this is definitely a favorite.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DeweyDell"
1111,"2008-05-13",4.6,"Batch 003.  Pours lighter than I expected, for a supposed brown ale.  A cloudy orangish color with a small but very well retained white head.  The head never goes down.  Looks fairly carbonated with a continuous stream of bubbles ascending. Impressive sheets of lace coat the entire glass. Aroma is mild peppery funk, soft and subtle, reminiscent of a lambic.  Slight cherry aromas akin to a Kriek are also apparent, though they dont pop out.  Warmer temperatures do this beer good, bringing out some acetic qualities that add a pleasant dimension and increase overall complexity.  This is the same quality I enjoyed in Compunction, the only other Russian River sour beer Ive had to this point.  Some light vinegar notes are buried deep down that remind me of a more traditional Flemish Sour though they are quite subtle.  Warmer temperatures also increase the cherry aroma, thankfully.  Cant detect any wine characteristics in the aroma.  Taste is immediately tart, wow, yeah, with some sourness mid-palate coupled with intense ripe fruit notes then finished with an even more acidic sourness.  While the aroma is quite subtle and soft the taste is really full blown on this one.  The huge cherry taste is really remarkable.  It makes the tartness much more tasty and multi-dimensional than just straight-forward sourness, though this is plenty sour.

Striking sourness is balanced by a lactic creaminess that just makes this brew so incredibly easy to drink.  Both batches were excellent.  Russian River kicks ass.Batch 002.  Pours a cloudy, blood red color.  A minimal, foamy tan head slowly dissipates, leaving just a thin ring behind.  The aroma features pure, fresh, sour cherries as the backbone.  Soft oak and moderate lactic funk emerge, as do hints of Concord grape juice.  The flavor is again based on sour cherries, but the grape element really surprises.  The use of Pinot Noir barrels (my favorite red grape) is nothing short of genius.  The softness of the Pinot lends itself perfectly to a sour ale, and the oak is subtle enough to impart its signature vanilla note without overpowering things.  Slightly more substantial than an average sour, the mouthfeel is highly carbonated, yet smooth and silky.  Finishes bone dry, with the mouth begging for the next sip.  As I stare at my empty glass, I am saddened, and that is the sign of a fantastic brew.  Russian River is simply incredible.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1111,"2008-01-11",4.3,"Batch 002; Sampled January 2008
A careful, persistent pour yields a fat-one-finger thick, dingy, tan colored head.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, light cherry red color.  Tart aromatics of acetic acid, lactic acid and moldy cheese are the first thing I notice in the nose.  Quite fruity, but it is a sort of non-descript, perhaps berry-like, sweet fruitiness.  The barrel character is present, but held well in check by the other aromatic components; touches of vanillin, a backdrop of spicy oak, some hints of butterscotch around the edges and a tannic character that is definitely noticed.  The nose is quite funky, teetering on the edge of being off; over-ripe cheese, penicillin and buttery oak notes all contribute to this.  Compared to a Lambic, this has quite a bit of acetic acid character to it, which is something I always enjoy if kept to a reasonable level.

Tart tasting, in fact very tart tasting; this is a nice mix of lactic and acetic notes.  The lactic acid is the more prevalent not, but I am not sure that the lesser amount of acetic acid is not the most noticed part of the acidity.  Flavors of tart cherries, tamarind and star fruit are all noticeable in this exceedingly dry beer.  The body actually has a bit of heft to it though, which should be attributed to the barrel contribution and touches of residual malt character.  Dry cherry notes, rich (though diluted) balsamic character, .  A tannic, tongue coating note in the finish adds spicy almost piquant oak flavors that coat the tongue in a long finish.  The barrel adds notes of buttery oak, spicy wood, some soft, creamy vanillin and probably even some berry flavors (assuming that the noticed berry flavors are coming from the Pinot Noir part of the barrel).  As the beer warms it really starts to come into its own; the fruit & malt seem to balance the sour notes all that much more and make this even more enjoyable.

This is quite a bit more acetic in character than batch one.  This is actually quite hard for a red / brown styled sour beer.  An aggressive, but enjoyable, experience if you are into that sort of thing.  I like that the oak character is much more integrated (though it still plays a significant role) than it was in batch one, but it still has a little ways to go before it hits that perfect balance between malt and funk / oak.  This is still a fantastic beer, but I cant wait to see if Vinnie can dial this in a bit more over the next couple batches.
Batch 001: Sampled July 2005
4.3 7/4/9/4/19
Pours a hazy ruby red color when held up to the light, an amber color otherwise.  The head is thin and tan in color.  The aroma is dominated by a fresh oakiness, but, especially when I was pouring this, there is a nice acetic acid note to this that reminds me of a Rodenbach.  The nose has notes of buttery oak, hints of cherries, balsamic, and a certain tannic woodiness.  The aroma is quite well integrated with a great balance to it, though it does lean toward the acidity, which I am partial to.

The taste is fairly dry, much drier than the pasteurized Flemish beers, but still strikes a malty balance with a bit of caramel complexity to it.  The finish is pleasingly acidic, with a leaning towards the acetic side of things.  This beer is really well done, I am quite impressed, this is quite a bit farther along than the temptation.  The finish has notes of a tannic woodiness, plus a long sour note that lingers along with the woodiness.  This beer certainly reminds me of cherries, with a nice fruitiness to it.  The more I drink it the more I become enamored of this beer, an authentic Flemish style sour beer that has not been pasteurized.  This is quite a bit better, and much more balanced than New Belgiums La Folie.  There is a wonderful interplay between the oak, maltiness, and acid character; this is superb and I cant wait to get more vintages of this.

It poured a rich mahogany with a nose of fruit and sour cherry.  Mouthfeel had some bite.  This might not be for everyone because my brother took one sip and poured his share into my glass.  I believe this  is supposed to taste the way it does and is a good example of its type, but overall it was not the blockbuster brew I  was expecting.

1111,"2007-12-29",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2014 Bottle from franksnbeans -- thanks! Batch 002, tasted 12/29/07.

The cork pops with a satisfying vigor, vapors streaming skyward. The beer pours smooth, a small head, sediment staying down at the bottom of the bottle. The beer itself is absolutely beautiful. The color varies strikingly according to the viewing direction: now a warm red-orange, now rose emerging from a dark body, but from every direction, it simply glows. 

The aroma: aaah. Rich, sweet sour ale. Hints of chocolate truffle and pie cherry juice. Wood infused throughout, lactic aromas throughout, brett laid out across it all. Wonderful. 

In the flavor, a powerful sourness, but not over-the-top in any way. Plenty of brett meeting the lactic flavors. Beneath it, oh, yes, those cherries - almost subtle but essential. Lively carbonation on the tongue, gently accenting the sour refreshing nature, acidic enough to contort the lip, never so acidic as to burn into the throat or nasal passages.  

Im lucky to have had the chance to try this one. The sourness is uncompromising but its not what defines the beer. What defines this one is the balance of wood and cherries, brett and inner glow. Superb.

Batch 02, Jan 2014. This one has aged like a dream. Cherries take a back seat but the sour is perfect, rich but never harsh. Much better than the rather abrasive beer Ive had fresh on tap. What a gem! Id go 4.3 on this and would adjust my scoring accordingly (9 instead of 8 for flavor) if there was any way to regularly score 6 year old bottles.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

375 ml bottle purchased at Texas in Carlsbad, California. Batch 6, (006X2) on label. First pour is a clear golden, ruby with a smallish off white head. Subsequent pours became more hazed, I had stored the bottle upright for about 2 months in my wine fridge. Fine carbonation bubbles are evident. Aroma is sour cherries, high tannin wood, and the dry leathery Brett. The sour is quite smooth, and blends nicely with the Barrel. The taste is brightly acidic and tart, the cherries along with a citrus lemon, then woody barrel, and finishing with the dry earthy leather. All the flavors are nicely integrated. The palate is really nice, medium to light bodied, quite smooth, perfect level of bright carbonation, sour and drying finish with a nice woodiness in the long finish. (8,4,9,5,16 - 4.2)

The flavor is mostly sour cherries up front, but later leads to a yeasty flavor also with some oak barrel and sweet rich malts. High marks for uniqueness. Great!","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1111,"2007-12-28",4.1,"June 2007 - Batch 01 - This beer might have the most beautiful red amber body I have ever seen, with a big and small bubbled some what lasting head; Maybe I expect to much from these BA sour RRs, but I get slightly disappointed evey time I have one. The nose is great it has everything, it just gives it self up way to easy, it lacks the Belgium (sour Belgiums) toughness, roughness, the ""you wont get me that easy"" attitude, they need more MALE attitude. You can feel the lactic sourness in the nose but it is hidden by the sweet cherry cinnamon perfumed to easy aromas that is also way to present in the NB Enigma; The body is good and a little more complex then the nose, a wooden barrel like tannin harshness is a little to present otherwise it is balanced with a very little sourness, a little bitterness and to much to big bubbled carbonation; It finishes a bit to short, aromas and feel grows big right when the beer is swallowed, but fades to fast, a very small lactic touch, again lots of barrel tannins, some barrel aroma but also tons of this sweet cinnamon cherry aroma that is much better fitting in a cake  then in a beer. It is very strange that the cherry aromas in US beers are so very, very much different from the cherry aromas in Belgium beers, uhh there are some good Belgium sours!","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"

Taste starts out mild then BAM, huge rush of tarty goodness. You want to pucker its so sour. Finally mellows out with the oak and cherry peaking through. Medium in the mouth and a tickle of either carbonation or the tartness giving its finishing move. You want to sip this because larger samplings at a time would be a waste. A very tasty and different libation.","Columbus, Maryland, USA","franksnbeans"
1111,"2007-12-19",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2009 Batch 02.  Pours a hazy copper-amber color with an even off-white that fades quickly, but can be roused up.  Fantastic sour acetic notes touched by sour cherry and oak.  The acetic aroma has an interesting unique sharpness to it.  The taste is a perfect blend of sour supplied by the funk and fruity sourness of the cherry.  The dryness in the finish really gives a vinous feel to the brew.  Just enough carbonation to deliver the tartness on to the palate without being overbearing.  A great sour ale.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

Nose begins with a sour overlay with barnyard funk and vibrant cherries. In the background aroma oak, red wine and apples are also apparent. Initial taste of a sparkling mouthfeel with a puckering sour cherries that coat the mouth incredabily. Flavor is far from somedued here. Moving into lots of brett yeast. Lemon & apple also lingering the background. Finishing with a citrus rhine bitterness, but not overwhelmingly harsh which is usually the case. But just enough to be pleasant and enjoyable. The palate duration is average. Good head retention. Medium body.","Norwood, Massachusetts, USA","Alldaydrinker"

1111,"2007-12-10",4.3,"Batch 002.  Poured hazy reddish-brown, with decent amount of head.  The aroma is incredibly alluring, sucking me in with huge funky sourness along with cherries and some oak presence as well.  The taste, well its amazing of course.  Sour cherries hit me first, then comes the Bretty funk, and last as if it werent enough, the oak and wine provide the finale to this wonderful beer.  Mouthfeel was kind of light and spritzy, looking for a little more here I must say.    People seem to think this is nowhere close to batch 001.

1111,"2007-12-06",5.0,"I made a mistake. Pantanap hooked me up with a bottle of this beer in one trade, so I cancelled a bottle of it I had going on in another trade.  Pours a caramel brown pour with a small white head.   Nose is full of sour and sweet notes, a bit of funk, apple cider, cherry and other light fruits.  maybe a little pear.  Flavor-wise it was obviously sour, but a delicous not over the top sour.  Apples and pear and cherry a bit of barnyard precense.   Notes of wood, oak it seems. Hints of lemon, grass, leather, oh and a bit of sourness. Honestly the best beer I have consumed in a long time, maybe ever.    Give me a case.  At first I thought, fantastic beer.....4.5 maybe a little higher. But as I sat here and took down a whole bottle it quickly and continuously kept getting better and better.

1111,"2007-12-04",4.4,"This beer is batch 002 and consumed on 3/15/07. When I popped the cork, the beer rocketed out. The beer is dark amber in color with little yeasties floating in suspension. Floating yeast is to be expected from a bottle conditioned beer. The head fell quickly, although I did leave the bottle for a bit after it ran over. The aroma has a strong brett presence with a cidery aroma in there as well. The tart cherry taste, brett, and carbonation make the glands in my neck tingle. The brett is very pronounced and seems to make the body seem lighter and thinner. Overall, the only disappointment is the lack of body.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

I like it like a college prank that is fun for its own sake. So dry my tongue shrivels up. Very fizzy sour body. Amazing how similar this style of beer can be to a particular style of sour candy with a fizzy baking soda characteristic. Offers up sour shivers. Sourness runs roughshod over the malt and cherries. Admirable more for artistry than flavour.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"

Pours with a foamy head that quickly turns into nothingness.  Beer is dark orange and brown like a really dehydrated piss.
Aroma can best be described as brown: subdued cherry, a slight sourness, and funk.  
Taste is sourness and cherry with a lot of off flavors.  Oh man, I think I got an infected bottle!  
Okay, seriously... The yeasts and bacteria compete for dominance in this beer with the sour cherry adding another layer to the beer- as if it really needs to be any more complex.  
The only detraction I could see is that the mouthfeel is a little oily.
Very decent.

1111,"2007-11-16",4.2,"Corked and caged bottle from JCB - thanks!  375 mL from Batch 002.  Superb, robust sour cherry aroma, leathery with some nice funky brett (still young, though).  Tart and brings liquid to the eyes.  Letting it sit for a while brings out the wood.  Cloudy brown-red particulate body, pretty classic with a short, noisy beige head.  Powerfully sour taste, tart and acidic, assertive without being industrial.  Dark sour cherry and a buttload of brett.  Woodiness isnt readily identified as oak and is more of a minor player here.  The blend, however, is rather fine - complex and unified, sprinkled here and there with spice and pittless skins.  More drinkable than just about any sour not named Rodenbach, way too flavorful even for 7% and not dominated by its potent acidity.  Full body is effervescent and puckering, a little harsh on the throat but not off-putting.  Dry, slightly balsamic aftertaste.  Teeth brushed by cherry stones and walnut hides, dry tannic leather and refreshing boldness.  One of the best sours in the world, let alone the Left  Coast.Side note: Is anyone else annoyed that the label defines supplication, a noun, as if it were a verb?","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1111,"2007-11-15",4.6,"Batch 1 - fresh, at 6 months and 1 year. After 1 year Batch 1 started to lose its lustre, and batch 2 never was anywhere nearly as exciting. Deep amber pour with varying red highlighting and a cloudy swirling center. A bold, frothy head is beige and recedes quickly. The nose is spectacular! Grapes, brown sugar, twisted funkiness, vinous qualities everywhere, tart cherries, light must, vibrant yeast including loads of brettanomyces, horseblanket, ginger and a formidable blast of old oak. Alcohol is almost undetected. The flavor is astonishing! This completely destroys just about all of its sour brethren, concerning taste, drinkability and mouthfeel. Sparkling carbonation evenly disperses malts and sourness to the farthest reaches of the mouth. Tart fruits and brazen acidity battle funk like its the last chance either will have to propagate their future. Sweetness is mild and soothing, cooling the fiery spice and complimenting the funk that gives this beer the feeling that its been brewed by dozens of dedicated generations. The finish is very tart and highly acidic, breaching into a refreshing sourness and leaving cherry and oak notes to dry out the tongue. I dream of the day a fresh batch of this is re-released that shares the assertiveness and glory of the first bottles of this I sampled. A profound, startling experience.

This is the Brettanomacron of beer, cuz this kills! Yes, thats Brettanomyces mixed with Necronomacon. Look it up on Wikipedia.

Served up in a nice chalice. Pours a deep brownish-red color with a nice foamy light brown head. The bubbles soon settle a bit and leave a nice layer of lace covering the top of this brew. Little coat of lace is left down the sides of the glass in its wake. The smell of cherries is apparent the second you pop the cork from the cute little 12.7oz bottle. Give the chalice a swirl and take a sniff. Big sweet cherries fill the nose. Nice bit of malt sweetness manages to break through. Another swirl, take a quick sniff and then take a sip. A nice bitter and tart cherry flavor coats the tongue. Sweet and sour mingle and dance on the palate then give way to a bit more sweetness and a touch of malt body. The aftertaste comes in with a nice sweet cherry flavor and a smooth malty note. This wild brew is superbly crafted and may have gotten better with even a bit more age (although the 15 months theyve already aged it plus the 3 or so months it sat in my closet in addition to the time it sat at the traders house (cant recall who sent me this one) plus the time on the store shelves has been more then enough).","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WankerWeasel"

1111,"2007-07-09",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2008 Batch 2 - bottle from Capones.  Pretty reddish color with a nice off-white fizzy head.  Sour aroma with some winey-grape, wood, apple, cherry, and pleasant funk.  Taste is pleasantly sour with lots of sour fruit - cherry, apple, lemon.  A nice amount of woody/oak/wine in there.  Ol Brett really shines in this one.  Really nice feel on the tongue, though it fell just a notch below the dancing feel of Cuvee de Castleton - My only regret is that I hadnt had the Captain Lawrence brew so recently as this one deserves to stand on its own as an outstanding brew.  Its pretty brilliant.  And to think Im just getting into the world of wild ales.......... Rerate of a 002 in June 08 - still great, but that woody nose is even better.  What a beer!","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
1111,"2007-07-07",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2009 Courtesy of boboski, damn, how am I going to repay you?  I always seem to get a bit hyped when I open one of Vinnies barrel aged elixirs.  Pours a reddish brown color.  Aroma is insane.  Cherries, sourness, earth, vanilla, Granny Smith apples.  Flavor is intense, full bore and in your face.  Fruit is there, wood is there, hell yes, the funk is there.  Amazing.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
1111,"2007-07-07",4.5,"batch 002.  Deep red beer with a sweet fresh cherry aroma, lovely fruit skin tannins and a bit of brettanomyces funkinss.  Lots of tart acetic/lactic character as well.  Soft sourness with a very well-integrated oakiness.  Vanilla character behind the fruit and sweetness.  Warming brings up a soft oaky earthiness with a light musky scent.  Flavour is also amazing, sweet cherry, oak, vanilla and a soft lacto/pedio chewy acidity.  Dank and dark with a heavy earthy vineousness throughout.  Funk and barnyard wrapped in a blanket of cherries and woody tannins.  Words dont really do this one justice... this is wild ale at its best.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1111,"2007-06-15",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 20, 2008 June 2007.  Batch 002.  Impenetrable pour, rusty red in color.  A thin layer of foam stays the course.  Nose of pears, cherries, old leather, some honey.  Rose blossoms and almonds.  Cayenne pepper and Italian dressing are first on the tongue; taut and precise.  Powerfully tart cherries, white grapes, vinous oaky notes, lactic acid.  Many shades of pepper, finishing on a brilliant, firey kick.  A bretty lemon juice pulse, with a salty flourish of attic-kept cured meats.  The wild character of the yeast is flawlessly integrated, gnawing at the rinds of the sweet cherries with the right rub of sawdust bite.  Wrought fully with strange intrigue.  An unpolished diamond, and rightly so.  Thanks Keith! 9/4/9/4/19 4.5

 July 2008.  Batch 003.   Pours a bloody gold.  Aroma is tangy and tart with a soft sweetness of wildflower honey and feathery rose essence laying as a blanket over sour cherries, musty pinot wood, and white and black pepper.  The soft nuttiness of its sweetness gives it an angel food-pistachio creme cake feeling.  Yeast is cooling, gravelly and rustic.    Flavor hasn’t yet settled into the biting crunch of apple cider vinegar that I remember.  It’s more a soft champagne vinegar and caramelized pear concoction, erudite and relaxed, and smartly balanced between sweet and tart; at this point of youth it really strikes a calm and comforting pose balancing sharp cherry tartness, leathery wild yeasts, and the soft sunny sweetness of jammy pinot flavors.    Yeast poured.  The gravelly character that keeps recurring is so musty and dry that it recalls the sharp edge of a dry white cheese aged in basement cobwebs.  White pepper spice lends a searing quality reminiscent of a gorgeous gueuze.  And this opens up in the aroma as well.    Medium palate is sprightly with carbonation and highly acidic.  Youth shows again in the finish, which is gorgeously soft and only lightly leathery, with a pomegranate aril and lemon juice flavor eventually yielding that punchy cheesiness that showed up mid-palate.  I love how this is dominantly quiet and calm in semisweet tartness, while also offering a glimmer of visceral lambic-like sour violence throughout.  The rustic and refined happily together.  Thanks Steve! 9/4/9/5/19 4.6","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1111,"2007-03-04",4.4,"Bottle from the RR store.  Thanks.  I have wanted to try this one for a really long time, for a few reasons: one - its from Russian River, and two - its a sour ale aged in red wine barrels.  Plus the added bonus of some cherries!  Pours a dark brown color with a thick yellow head that disappears as quickly as it forms.  The smell is sour cherries, some red wine notes, but mostly it smells like you chopped open an oak tree and smell into the middle of it.  Fantastic smell.  Taste is full of sour and oak notes, with a little bit of cherries but mostly it is dominated by the pinot barrel flavor.  Very light and easy to drink, this is really good stuff.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"
1111,"2007-03-02",3.6,"Tap. Well I am still not totally into this style. This one pours with a brown color. Aromas of cherry and citrus. Flavors are tart, not too sour but quite intense. Probably as sour as I can handle.","Bay Area, California, USA","HopheadHans"
1111,"2007-02-17",4.3,"Pours with a bright amber body topped by a thin, fizzy head with little lacing left on the glass.

1111,"2007-02-13",4.5,"Fricken fantastic. Just a really well done beer that if handed to you in a glass not knowing what it was would just make you stand up and dance. Pours amber/copper with a  tall white head. Very nice funky brett taste, earthy, musty, dry, with a sour finish. Cherries and wood shine in the high carbonation with a tart finish that keeps you fully refreshed thinking you might find a way to finish off that monster of a bottle by yourself, maybe tuck it under your jacket while no one is looking and go and hide under the porch and sip away in peace.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1111,"2007-02-13",4.0,"Pours a brassy red with an open bubbled white head.  The aroma is a sharp sour fruit.  Cherry and other dark fruits with a brett based musty character.  Great sourness and funky on the nose.  The flavor is a mellowed tart fruit full of sour cherries and funky flavors.  Sharp combination of vinegar, red wine, grapes, vinous, and saltiness.  Even a funky fermented fruit with only a tiny hint of alcohol coming through.  Mouth watteringly sour on the finish.","Zionsville, Indiana, USA","atpayne"

Lightly catty and barnyardy nose w/ a leathery and oaky wood aromas.  Sour cherry is very light and also has a little ""band aid"" plasticy yeast character similar to Jolly Pumpkin.  Malt character is a little bready & lightly grainy.  Cherry aromas get a little stronger as it warms, and also develops some nutty malt, and do I detect a hint of chocolate?  Flavor is well balanced, cherry and toasted malt flavors, not overly sour but more like mildly tart to help cut malty sweetness.  Lightly dry finish w/ a bit of caramel and nutty malts.  Cherry flavor is light compared to aroma, and has some dry woody flavors into the finish and lingering aftertaste, which is also a bit sugary flavored, but not sweet.  Bready malts and an earthy and spicy yeast character.  Lively carbonation w/ well hidden alcohol, smooth, medium body.  A lot less sour than Id imagined it would be.

Aroma is quite sharply acidic with some tart sour cherries, oak, and a moderate bretty funkiness.  Flavor is quite dry with lots of crisp cherry up front, light acidity, light green apple.  Finishes very dry with a lingering but restrained bretty funk combined with oak tannins.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very dry, with active efforvescent carbonation.

This is a stellar beer, really damn amazing.  


bottle batch 001.  Happily consumed at the Brickskeller in Washington DC on 11/25/06, first brew of the night.   Pours cloudy straw with a small head.  The scent is robust and fully of cherry and oak.  The taste is much more like the description then the type, more like a dark ale heavily infused with cherries.  The taste is wonderful it flows over the tongue and leaves a nice sweat aftertaste.  My brother commented that it tasted sort of like a lambic, its certainly different from other flemish sours I have had, it was damn good Ill say that much.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
1111,"2006-11-19",4.0,"Murky light brown, golden around the edges with a light fizzy head that stayed low. Great aroma in which all the aspects of its production show well but never take over. Oak, then brett, then wine and a touch of cherries. (duh, i guess). Carbonation is low despite the loud pop upon uncorking. Flavor is big on the oak, moderate (perfect) amount of funk, plenty of red wine, although it stays where it should, and really just a touch of cherries in the finish that linger next to the other flavors. Not incredibly sour, more wine like than tart.  Overall this was a more suttle beer than i expected, but top-notch nonetheless. I got light-headedjust trying to take in all the complexity in the aroma. In one word... Lovely.","Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA","MuchoBoracho84"

1111,"2006-11-05",4.3,"Sampled at Dr. Bills party, and I am sure glad I did. One of the samples was straight diacetyl, and was worthy of a drain pour, but I will rate the good sample. Sampled from a beautiful 1.5L bottle, probably the most gorgeous bottle I have seen to date. Pours a murky/cloudy golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is quite nice and not overly sour. Mustiness, sour cherries, and oak are everpresent. Flavor is amazingly well balanced, and definitely moreso than most interpretations of this style. Hints of cherry tartness and oaky vanilla work perfectly together.  The finish is very tight and not overly sour. Definitely an amazing brew.","California, USA","KAME"

1111,"2006-10-26",4.2,"Brooding of a hazy brick hue, its head bubbles to a buttery hat. Supplication is well named, its aroma wafts a wreathing amalgam of soothing scents drawing you in by its prophetic grandeur yet emanating of an earthy presence. Vinous and sweet, laced in a keen oaken complexion and the smooth sourness of apple and cherry. Condensed milk, vanilla and brown sugar add to the blend a luscious finish. The palate is surprisingly light-bodied, sour in the gentlest way, but complex and different with every sip. Pinot noir is obvious, as are the oak and vanilla tones conferred by the beers aging. Wild strawberry and melon liqueur perform prestidigitatory tricks upon the tongue only to evaporate in a poof leaving behind nothing more than a raw lactic acidity and the aftertaste of Champagne. Russian River has brewed a Flemish Sour for sure, entertaining as the best examples, but perhaps lacking the proper balance.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Juicy, acidic, sour, yet quite smooth and refreshing.

Head is average, white, frothy, mostly diminishing. The aroma is much like a FSA, but with a lot more earthiness: Malty with light notes of toasted grain, caramel; Hoppy with a moderate-to-heavy note of herb, lemon zest; Yeasty with light notes of horseblanket, trace of band-aid/plastic beach ball ; Miscellany contains a heavy note of vinosity, moderate-to-heavy notes of cherries, sherry, raisin/date and oak, trace balsamic and allspice. The flavor is moderately sweet, moderately-to-heavily tart/acidic with a long, moderately acidic/tart/dry, lightly sweet finish.

Sour fruit and vinegar nose, with sharp aromas of tart, sour cherries, tart apple, rotten grapes, and a vinegar quality similar to red wine gone bad. Flavor is very well balanced sour fruit over a nice, crisp, light malty beer, with nice hints of the pinot and subtle tart cherry. Sour funkiness sticks to your tongue and cheeks in the finish. Quite nice, and I like how light it is, even at the 7%.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","walter"
1111,"2006-05-11",4.2,"Bottle (courtesy of cquiroga, as always) into Duvel tulip glass (the best tasting glass ever).  Dope beer.  Uniformally hazy ruby grapefruit color with yeast floaties in suspension.  Medium to small off-white head diminishes to a thick ring and surface dusting.  Brittle sudsy lace crumbles and slides leaving a ring around the glass; racing is deep, slow and plentiful.  Ripe cherry smell is wonderfull, enhanced by a crisp lemony acidity and spiderweb brett aroma, with a little ginger.  Crisp and lively up front, medium body fills the mouth with flavor, becomes light and spacious right before the swallow.  Lots going on in the flavor: sour apple and cherry predominate at first with a biting woodsy/alcoholic tang (from the barrel, I guess) that dries the beer out just a bit but retaining the mouthwatering acidity.  The flavors in the finish take on a lighter, melony quality, like honeydew and watermelon, without the sweetness.  An acrid bitterness in the finish seems a bit untutored, and detracts from the overall impression; it comes on a couple seconds after the swallow, lies on top of the soft melony flavors, and then gets drowned in a resurgent acidity which is nice, so its not really a big deal.  Also, I wish the cherry were a bit fuller, but I like the balance of fruity and earthy qualities.  A sour, balanced beauty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Pour of half cloudy amber with a henna center and orange fringe. Head of micro champagne bubbles, rising to a whipped creamy froth of honey. At long last, that creamy coconut and pineapple flavor that Ive been searching for, ever since savoring New Glarus Sour Brown. The perfect use of bacteria! Wild sweetness, blending with light tannins in a valley of dried apricots. Sweet and dry. A perfect balance of sour. Alcohol warms the nostrils and a glow of fresh Rainier cherries tumbles down the cascade of rich sweet malt. A touch of sherry vinegar, morphing into a gentle cream with plum and raisins. Delicate. Finish is so amazingly smooth and graceful. Im very impressed with the palate in this beer, lingering on in unctuous beauty. Wraps up with the perfect balancing light wafts of drying grasses. Smack of apples, pears and white pepper. Thanks Andy!


375mL Bottle. Batch 003. Thanks Andy! Aroma rises with a tight waft of pastry dough, coconut cream, sour cherries, and baked apple pie. All the wonderful wanderings for sourness, fruit and malt married together. A bit of fall leaf, cherry stem and apple core finish. Pours a glowing fiery red-orange, translucent, with a swirling edge of whitish. Flavor is tight and tart. Wow. Crisp juicy tart apple flesh segues to coconut husk, dry cotton and sweet cherry blossom. A married flavor profile. Dry perfume closes the balance and gives a long apricot brandy finish, with a light edge of tart pucker. Delicate, blossoming and fruitful. Stunning, yet again. Rides out with a very mature and complex brandy, fruitcake and almond liquer. Re-rate. 949518.

375mL Bottle. Batch 005x3. Strong and tartly citric. Really sharp and cherry forward, with some the cherry bitterness being distinct mid-palate.

This cloudy amber brew with an effervescent champagne-like head gave off aromas of fruit and spices, notably very tart cherries and nutmeg, with some gingersnaps and a woody, vinous essence from the wine barrels.  The tart, almost sour, cherries took front stage in the flavor and, much as I love cherries, they didnt make it for me here.

As the beer flows out of my bottle and into the glass my nostrils are greeted by a waft of sour cherries.    Burying my nose deep into my glass, I smell some sweeter notes of green apple peel as well.  This beer is overflowing with tart red fruits: raspberry, thimbleberry, and chokecherries abound.  Very sour initial impact on the tongue is quickly followed up by a flavor sensation similar to that of a finely mulled gluehwein.  The mouthfeel is actually surprisingly creamy textured, far less carbonated than I expected.  As the beer rolls across the back of my tongue I am reminded of fresh yogurt topped with seedy boisenberries.  Very vinous finish is definitely where the Pinot Noir aging shines through.

1111,"2006-02-13",3.1,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2009 (on bottle batch 001)So, US flemish sour to dropkick, hahah. No really, this is my first try om the brewery(of witch I have heard nothing but praises) and north american efforts to make oud bruin-like-kind-of-beer, so let´s see. Has a fine nose, vanilla, gooseberries, raspberries, malts. the blend of malt and tatness is great. murky brown, with small, beige head. the taste starts great, zingy and with a good carbonation level. get´s more nutty and rounded. The finish bothers me. It´s like the wood gets too dry and earthy on me, I get a sandpaper feeling on the tounge. Also, the finish lacks the vineouros and fruityness of brown ales with sourness and the likes.
RERATE AUG 08. Probaly batch 003.  Amber, small, white head. Semi-tart cherry, wood, cherrykern nose. On-the-spot balance between tart, sour and sweetness here. Very well made this time, but a rather waterish mouth. The finish contains alot of what the aroma had, but more suttle, nutty ways too 4.2","DENMARK","JensenTaster"
1111,"2006-02-12",4.1,"Bottle, ""Batch 001"". Poured deep murky amber with a thin light-tan head and a few flecks of yeast floating around. Impressive aroma reminiscent more of red wine than beer: somewhat floral, obvious cherry and pinot influences, slightly nutty. Initially tasted in tiny sips to disappointing effect: cherries cherries cherries and confused other flavors. Happily, though, the flavor profile seems to open up much more with larger sips. Again, the pinot noir and cherry influences are readily apparent and highly enjoyable (if quite surprising in a beer). I do not detect any vinegar sourness unlike some other tasters. There is definitely some tartness, but I attribute it to the wine and cherries. Other flavors drift in and out as I move toward the bottom of the glass: spices, prune, nuts, pear, faint licorice and fainter wood. Initially the finish was farily dry (reminiscent of wine again) but has rather strangely become buttery(!) and a little sweet toward the bottom of the glass--another pleasant surprise. Smooth, vaguely creamy mouthfeel with less carbonation than expected. An intriguing and very different experience overall.","Berkeley, California, USA","ghorsche"

Aroma is earthy, with some vinegar and surely the cherries.  The Pinot Noir came out in the flavor, and really enhanced the raisin and prune aspects of the brown ale.  The pour was a boring, flat orange, and the palate was a bit sharp, yet crisp and tingly.  Where it counts (aroma and flavor) this is a winner.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"

Flavors of dark cherry and light spice and oak. The flavoring does not linger too long though.  The finish is extremely dry and feels like it is sucking the moisture from your tongue as you drink it.

My sample size wasnt too large, but thankfully, I can rerate down the road thanks to Noah procuring a second bottle. Notes of ginger, peach, sour cherry, and nutmeg on the nose lead into more of the same on the palate. The sour cherry quickly takes the lead, but theres a nice presence of tannins and oak from the barrel ageing. Hard to drink this without thinking of La Folie, and it would be fun to sample the two side by side. All in all, a fun (but short-lived) experience.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
1111,"2006-01-18",4.4,"Bottle thanks to kramer17801.  It opened to a snap of carbonation and then a rush of foam coming out of the bottle.  The brew is a nice hazy orange with a tint of brown and white head, while pleantiful, went away quick enough.  Aroma smells of the cherries and oak, similar to DFHs Festina Lente.  Flavor, thankfully, is much nicer than the previosuly mentioned beer.  There is very little souring bitterness for the conditions this beer went through.  Malty, rich, smooth, complex, this beer is confusing my senses.  There is a slight spicyness at first, like cinnamon and ginger, then a yeast flavor, all while being backed by a subtle oak and cherry flavor.  Once the usual alcohol and strong ale sweetness subside in my mouth, then the cherry flavor comes out in a fine fashion.  This beer is tremendous.

1111,"2006-01-09",4.2,"6/05 bottle.  Hazy red-amber body, thin white bubbly head.  Ripe sweet cherry aroma with cinnamon-laced apple pie and an acidic linger.  When I first started sipping on this guy I thought it was a simplistic cherry kriek but with patience it gets better.  The biggest flavor component to me is bready yeast followed by sweet cherry skins, vanilla? and a chocolately malt pushed waay into the background.  As with the aroma theres an acidic aura over the whole flavor.  Finishes with tart cherry skin and citric acid.  Bubbly but medium-strength mouthfeel that leaves a bit of satisfying sweet stickiness on the tongue.  The beer with the cherries+barrels is pretty nice but the special yeasts do a fantastic job of offsetting the sweetness, and not with too much tartness/acidity!  This certainly isnt some bombastic Cantillon, this stuff has restraint.

Pours a brilliant cherry and rusty orange/brown body. A wispy cap of ivory foam sits atop. The aroma is raw yet tantric. Some sincere notes of oak, aged balsamic, sour cherries, leather, pressed red apples, and green grapes. The flavor reveals a wonderfully rounded sourness. The cherries stand out a bit more and the yeast presents itself with a wild doughy flavor, yet there is a biscuity malt backbone if you search for it. The palate is wonderful and the beer is set of with a sparkly champagne like effervescence. This is craftsmanship at its finest!

Sour grapes, pinot grigio, freshly squeezed lemons, pale figs, cotton, lilies of the valley and freesia.  Masochistically complex.  An anticipated souring presence is shunned for a performance of modest, balanced and elegant simplicity.  Oaken smoothness, mashed grapes, fig extract and cherry cobbler.  Its got its sourness but it maintains a healthy, welcoming plateau, never reaching an arguable forte of sourness.  Mild sour nodes are sustained by sweet fruity esters of nectarines, apricots and orange rind.  Light, delicately sour and omnipresent palate sense, neither forthright nor intimidated.

In the second fase there is a lactic freshness with hints of wood and some rubarbe jam. In the nose you can notice a sharp fruity acidity and the roundness of ripe red summer-berrys. The aroma of a big Bourgudy wine is not far away. The taste has a perfect balans. It is sweet and sour without being to sharp or to sweet. It is super complex and exposes a rim-ram of different accents on the pallet. First the ripe cherrys and the sour apples, some vanilla and greek yoghurt. The mouthfeel is light lively and has touches of bergamots. This beer is sharp and smooth at the same time. It is very wine-like and has some well hidden earthy tone.

1111,"2005-07-09",3.7,"Draft. Orange-brown color with a nice off-white head. Sour aroma. Rich sour flavor with bits of malt and oak with light lemon and peach. Dry finish.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
1111,"2005-07-06",4.1,"Bottle batch 1: Pours murky red with a large head that fades to a solid layer that stays. Aroma is tart cherry, chalky brett, sweet malt backing, mild wine, slight wood that blends into the malt. The aroma gains fathoms of depth as it warms. Flavor is slightly sour cherry, chalky brett, and a mix of butter, oak, and malt that meld into a cohesive graham cracker taste near the finish. The graham cracker follows into the aftertaste were it melds with a fruity red wine that slowly appear. The finish leaves the tip of the tongue very dry yet leaves the middle and back wet, interesting. The palate is a little thin but it isnt that much of a detractor.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
1111,"2005-07-05",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2005 Muddy amber-orange. Surprisingly buttery nose takes a minute to get accustomed to. Good oaky, cherry, dusty and woody flavours underneath, but the diacetyl is a wall you have to filter your way through. Spicy pineapple juice soaked in oak casks, nutty and lactic flavours.. Once again a territory owned by rancid butter, but the lactic aspects are gentle. Popcorn reminiscent finish in its burnt buttery feel. Nice thin bubbled carbonation, lightly oily medium body. Alright, it seems like we were unlucky and I’m excited enough about Russian River to re-sample that again for sure, at GABF in the worst case, but may this rating serve as a warming. This was a batch #1 bottle and I can only push the lucky souls holding onto bottles of this to be very patient and let it ferment well because it seems the bottles are still quite variable. 6-3-5-3-11 = 2.8 I finally got to try this on tap at BCTC 2005 and there was no diacetyl component at all which left us with beautiful vinous, nutty sweet and sour flavors of cherries, vanilla and a miraculous drying finish. Generous earthiness with a funky soily apple skin yeastiness. This goes from a 2.8 to a 4.1 in my book and is a piece of art.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1111,"2005-07-05",4.3,"Bottle - corked and caged. Batch 001. Muddled amber with a small whitish head. WOW! Nose is Brett, cherries, and FUNK! I love it! Im also smelling sour grapes out the ying-yang. This could almost be mistaken as a Cantillon product, from what Im smelling right now (still rather cool, temperature-wise, and no diacetyl as mentioned by others). Theres some lighter balsamic notes, and thinned woody aromas and a light earthiness as well. Fainter wine notes on this. I expected more considering it was aged in Pinot Noir barrels. At any rate, one of the best smelling beers Ive experienced in a long time. Taste is a bit uneven. Big Brett notes, lighter nuttiness, some grainy parts, light cherry but more wine. The wine grapes come through here the most. Towards the back end of the gulp. Still not picking up on any diacetyl. Ill let the rest warm to room temperature to explore that later. Right now, Im really digging whats in my glass. Body is light-medium with a pleasant dryness and minimal tartness. Theres note a lot of carbonation associated with this either. At times, this is almost still, like a wine. Finish is sour fruits, more Bretty notes, wood, light earth tones, and lighter wine notes. Very nice beer, even at the price. Recommended to all!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1111,"2005-07-01",4.3,"375ml corked bottle. Batch 001. Really nice packaging. The Russian River branded cage is really cool. Murky brown-orange body topped by a foamy light tan head that sticks around without diminishing more than 20-30% for the entire session. The aroma is lovely, lovely, lovely. Cherry, vinegar, must, oak, definite vinous character, butterscotch that increases as it warms. The flavor is very interesting and not at all what I expected. Very nutty up front (brown ale heritage I presume) then cherry and vinegar kick in. On the backside the buttery diaceytl comes through and teeters on the precipice of too much then a final nutty blast washes through. It exhibits a very soft body that starts full but lightens up towards the end. I quite like it, though it is not mind-blowing. I am quite interested to see how this one ages. That butter-blast might come forth even more pushing it over the precipice, time will tell.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
1111,"2005-06-30",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2007 Simply an amazing brew, with a fiery orange color, a dynamic and vibrant aroma and an astonishing medley of flavors.  Meticulous balance of cherries, yeast and oak, producing a range of flavors.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
1111,"2005-06-29",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2010 Very sour, abundant strawberries and cherries, lean body and high drinkability... Balance of tartness and wilderness... Bottles are a bit more idiosyncratic than the tap version, mainly due to carbonation being softer and the mouthfeel being more elegant, but both are definitely world-class Sour Ales...Batch 005 is making me bump the score up a bit; its simply amazing...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1111,"2005-06-29",4.4,"Batch 001: Rusty orange. Dirty-white foam falls to a puffy ring. Cedary, sherbety, moldy, rounded sour cherry nose with rhubarb, barnyard, and acetic acid. Quite musty with minerals and band-aid phenols. Tongue tickling carbonation. Slickness mirrors the bodys grit. Tart cherry skin explosion greets a boisterous brett-accented accompaniment of soft bandage phenols which, along with the fruitiness, films the palate. Phenols persist to caress the tartness and reinforce the musty medley of oak and minerals. Subtler, but perpetually slick and juicy, sour cherry elements continue to buoy the body and, along with the funky yeast and dried leather astringency, generate stimulating flashes of puckering acidity that constantly come and go. Moderate huskiness and vanillin oak absorb much of the fruit-derived tannins, but enough acidity remains to hold your attention and to prolong the dryness. Finishes brightly oaky and earthily husky as brisk skin tannins pierce the lapsing wall of gritty oak that lingers on the tongue. Comprehending the timeless devotion and resilient passion that was poured into the making of this is simply unfathomable. Vinnie is such an inspiration.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1111,"2005-06-29",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2007 Bottled. POurs a murky reddish brown.  Big cherry and barnyard aromas from the second I opened the bottle.  There is a small, fizzy, off-white head that fades very quickly.  Aromas from the glass are more cherries and horseblanket with some spices (nutmeg, clove) as well.  Flavors are many; cherries, grapes, apple cider, vanilla, roses, and spices.  Also malty and musty.  Very sharp tartness but it fades a bit right at the point of taking over the flavor.   Finishes dry.   

Batch 002.  Bottled.  Pours a slightly cloudy garnet color with a quickly dissipating, ivory head.  Tar aroma with a huge cherry note.  Soft and malty at first sip, going into a slight cherry flavor before the tartness hits you hard.  Somewhat buttery and grapey (are those words?)  Dry, tart finish.  This new batch is similar to what I remember the first to be and quite simply its one of the best beers made by one of my favorite brewers.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"

Whoa...now THAT is an aroma!  I havent given a 10 for aroma in quite a while, but man, this completely and utterly knocked me out.  I was left sniffing the empty glass for half an hour after I was finished...if that doesnt hint that this is a 10, I dont know what will convince you.  Its beyond my ability to describe.  This is sorta like equal parts fruit lambic (the really funky traditional kind, a la Hanssens Kriek, not the soda pop kind) and Flemish sour.  Wood aging shows, and is definitely old wood (noticeable but very mellow, earthy, and antique, not like raw wood...oak chips just aint the same, sorry Great Divide and Avery), and the Brett shines through as well.  But everything is so amazingly tied together and integrated...thats something that just cant be listed out with descriptors.  Could stand to have a little more tartness and even a smidge more carbonation, but those are very minor quibbles...another 6 months (to 6 years!) of aging should improve both.  You can keep your La Folie and your Cuvee de Tomme...as pleasant as those are, this is to me a far more enticing, balanced, and fully realized beer.  No rough edges at all in any sense.  This is one of the best Belgian style ales made in the United States (THE best?  maybe), of that there is absolutely no question in my mind.  Its definitely expensive ($10/375ml), but unlike La Folie, I think its well worth the price tag.  This is just crazy amazingly good beer, and I just know its going to be underrated here.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1111,"2005-06-24",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2008 Aroma is cherries, nutmeg, oak, and grapes.  Taste is cherries, oak, and a nice sourness.  Borders on Flemish sour, but could go either way.  Very Nice Brew.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
1111,"2005-06-12",4.7,"bottled in corked 375ml. beer pours a red-tinged brownish amber with good CO2 that forms decent head and lace (better than I would expect for the style). nose is hugely complex, with cherries, oak, barnyard funk, a sour, lactic tang - so much going on, but still it is a cohesive beer. flavor is again a riot of flavors, with all the above aromas showing up in the flavor, along with some flavors from the pinot cask. wow. this is a pretty damn faultless beer, and a real example of some of the innovation that Vinnie is bringing to the brewing industry. the only off note for me is the over-presence of alcohol in the finish. this is an extremely minor qualm, however, as this is a truly excellent beer. now if we can only get the erudition in the bottle...","Oakland, California, USA","irishsnake"
1111,"2005-05-26",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2005 Beautiful rose color, orange tones, light off-white film of a head, very minimal in fact, spotty lacing.   Oaken aroma, subtle kriek, very much like Verhaeghe Echte Kriek but softer.   Enjoyable tartness on first sip, similar to unripened cherries, notes of oak as well.   Decent palate, medium to full bodied.   Sweet & sour finish.   Somewhat soft and understated, but well balanced.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
1111,"2005-05-26",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2012 A vertical of this in June 2012 revealed a malty, sour Batch 2, with as much barrel as fruit, and an almost austere tartness. Batch 3 was toasty, a bit woody and with just a slight tartness.  The fruit was starting to drop out.  Batch 4 was fairly clean with the acid, and with balanced fruitiness.  Seemed in its prime.  Batch 5-2 was fresh, tart, fruity, and stil a little bit yeasty.  Batch 5-5 was the weakest of the bunch, malty, not very lively at all.  A dud, if you will.  Of the 5, the Batch 4 and Batch 5-2 were my favourites.Preview bottle courtesy Vinnie Cilurzo.  Vibrant reddish-amber colour, with clouds.  Orange-peach esters share the aroma with brettanomyces, leather and big Pinot Noir character.  The flavour is less voluptuous, but still pretty good with vinous notes and a hit of sweet cherry a la NGBR.  Fruity, balanced and unique.  Aging in wine barrels is definitely something I approve of - the flavours meld so naturally with estery beer styles.  re-rate:  Id orignially given this beer a 4.0 but every time Ive had it since I would have scored it higher.  Drinking it this morning is yet another heavenly Supplication experience...time to elevate the score on this one.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1111,"2005-02-10",3.7,"Tap @ Toronado.  This was the first beer of the ten Russian River brews at the tasting that ran out.  It was also the first time it was ever poured.  A cider and Rodenbach like flavor with a light cherry and vinous flavor.  The brown ale adds some depth to the pinot wine like elements.  Smooth and semi-sweet.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
