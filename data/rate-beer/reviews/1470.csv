1470,"2015-12-04",4.6,"A ""hordóérlelt De Molen"" szóösszetétel az én olvasatomban csaknem a tökéletesség szinonimája, már ami a söröket illeti, s ha az ember egy olyan üveget tart a kezében, amelynek szavatossági ideje lejártát a 2040. évben határozza meg a gyártó, azt is biztosra vehetjük, hogy a falak között szunnyadó ital megérdemli a különleges bánásmódot. Valójában csak kitartás kérdése, mely életszakaszában kívánjuk összeismertetni magunkat a 11,9%-os imperial porterrel, én azonban kissé kiábrándító módon már újszülött korában felkerestem a csodafőzetet. Tényleg nagy baklövés ez a részemről, mivel már az illatából is sugárzik a hosszan eltarthatóság jellege, szinte ordít az érlelésért, kissé elébe menve a dolgoknak elmondhatom, hogy minden egyes porcikája a szebb kor megérésére hivatott. Türelmetlenségemnek hála tehát már a gyártás évében letesztelhettem, s legyen bármennyire is fiatal az ital, összességében lehengerelt a karaktere. Sötétlő színe közepesnek tetsző textúrát csillant meg, már ha a kategória mértékegységét vesszük alapul, habja keskeny és fahéjszínű, aromái pedig bámulatosan teltek. Sülthúsos fűszeresség, hamus füstösség, orvosságos keserűség, édes és sós jegyek vad kavalkádja, ahol a kiemelkedő komponensek a forró csokoládé, túlérett meggy, bőr és vanília, sós karamell képében jelennek meg. Szirupos, lényegében szénsavtartalom nélküli textúra, sziporkázó savanykásság, füsttel kevert, befőttes édesség és nagy formátumú, kanalazhatóan testes ízjegyek. Utánozhatatlanul tartalmas ital, szinte elképzelhetetlen, mit hozna ki belőle még pár évtized.","HUNGARY","adster"

Interesting. The typical Porter notes are just in the background, dominated by vinous barrel notes.

In long: Nose is quite fruity (a lot more fruity than the regular Tsarina Esra) with vinous notes over a chocolate cake.  Taste follows through.  This is like a chocolate cake with red-grapes.  Not sure what to add to this simple description, maybe notes of Sherry.  Its not even vinous, just plain red grapes.  Well levelled medium carbonation.  11% remains mostly well hidden.

1470,"2011-08-29",3.7,"180mL nip thanks to Glouglouburp. Rating #200 for this rarity. Thank you Dany. WAWA!!! The pour is a deep mahogany with quite a healthy tan head. Creamy and rich mousse like. Webby lace. Nose is quite muted actually- tough to coax out the soft cinnamon, rose pedals, dry wood. Molasses and brown sugar is there with small cedar. Very subtle though. As it warms, you can coax out more complexity in the nose. Sharp, tangy booziness comes through from the Bordeaux and buttery chocolate. Creme brulee and raspberries. Exquisite, but one of the most stubborn aromas to get at. Very hard to coax out of the glass. Taste is woody, a little bit tart actually creating instead of a dense, sweet, and heavy chocolate body one more of lemon sorbet, roses, and cinnamon. Finishes a bit thin with woody dryness. As it warms, the palate gets a little richer with some silky almost butteriness. Fluffy, sponge cake palate. Almost aerated in profile. Very easy to love and relatively simple, but really lacking the power and intensity of Hel & Verdoemenis and their other heavy hitting imperial stouts. I guess I was expecting something really in your face but this is about as soft and subtle as they can be.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

1470,"2011-03-28",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Dark chocolate, coffee and red wine intertwine from aroma to sensuous finish in this elegant and cohesive Barrel-Aged Imperial Porter. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the brown-edged darkness.
-The soft carbonation is appropriate for the suave body. This is not a heavy Impy at all, this is rather elegant.
-The chocolatey finish is lovely.
-The flavor profile is perhaps linear, but it is pleasurable and harmonious.
-Subtle alcohol warming tags along the intelligent barrel presence.
-Malt flavors are ably developed; this is far from a sugar bomb.

1470,"2010-09-10",3.8,"Nip bottle, bought @ De Molen at the 1st BBF.
Pours pitch black in my glass. The head is velvety and thich, but still rather fizzy. Not quite beige, but somewhere between that and off-white. Stunning aroma. So much oak, so much malty sweetness. Roasted almonds, hazelnuts, ash, dark chocolate, still rather sweet. Some molasses. Light alcohol note. Low but prickly carbonation, mouthfeel is surprisingly light. Kinda velvety, but not really creamy. There are plenty of flavour though. Smoke, again molasses, light blackberry, viniousness, roasted malts, still a bit of roasted almonds. The oak probably gives it the relative lightness and it provides a fine, crafty tartness to the proceedings. Finish is vinious, dark chocolate, prunes and an unwillingness to let go of me. Just a perfectly crafted base beer in a good oak cask that sadly does it more harm than good. Especially in mouthfeel. Good, very good, nonetheless.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

The aroma is sweet with chocolate malts and dark fruits.  There is a slightly smoked malt presence and some light coffee and a faint oak character.  A fairly light aroma for a RIS.

The taste really mirrors the aroma with a dominant caramel, vanilla and chocolate sweetness.

1470,"2010-02-11",3.7,"Red wax dipped 18cl bottle, #634 of 1216 for this batch.  Brewed on February 19, 2009, bottled on October 8, 2009, and consumed in January 2010.  The pour yields a dark, hazy, chestnut to mahogany colored body.  A scant, light brown surface film recedes to a thin edge and leaves no lace.  Aromas are based in dark cocoa roast, quite earthy overall, with a good helping of toasted, vanilla laden oak, and a slightly odd, fruity, berry twang from the Bordeaux barrel.  Flavors delve deeper, again showing chocolate, but this time accompanied by loads of dark, figgy fruit.  Twangy, slightly tannic red wine notes work well as the counterpoint to the dark, roasty malts, while woody, toasted oak works to pull everything together.  The body is a little lighter than Id like, kind of roasty and slightly drying, with moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation.  A satisfying, alcoholic warmth creeps up on the finish, which lingers with smoldering dark fruit.  Interesting, nice brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Dark brown with a medium-sized beige and fizzy head quickly fading away. Not really any lacings.

The smell is nice and deep. Lots of round mature fruit aromas, some edgy spices, toffee and caramel. Bog woody notes. Not very roasty. Hints if minerals as well. A very vinous smell that really grows on you. 

The taste is dominated by rich vinous fruit notes coupled with earth, spices, minerals and a hint of plastic. Salt licorice and wood. Smooth and sweet malts struggle to break through, together with aromas of chocolate, toffee and caramel. Hints of grape skin. The finish is spot on with a perfectly integrated note of warming alcohol, dry semi-tart fruit notes and grass. The taste is really aromatic from start to finish.

Full bodied and smooth with a dry finish. 

All in all, very good and very impressive. The crude description ""tastes like a musty red wine blended with porter"" would actually be quite fitting. The wine barrel character is really intense, very close to overpowering. I really enjoyed this one.","Malme, SWEDEN","ricke"

Some medicinal and boozy notes upon the finish. The mouth feel is warming, sharp and astringent . Was a lot nicer once the phenolic character died down (or I got used to it).

1470,"2008-08-14",4.5,"A Mes rate: From a HUGE wooden cask at GBBF.Black with a thin but very stable tan head, good lace and awesome bubbles when swilled. A very good looking beer. Amazing roasty chocolate aroma that is full of freshly ground coffee and some awesome barrelly alcohol. Strong bourbon notes but not at all over done. This is how barrel aging should be done. The flavour carries on in an almost equally incredible fashion. The oak is a little more apparent and somehow the chocolate has become even richer and darker and moved on into the 100% cocoa category. Superb roasted nut and oaky booze finish. Tart and full of action. This is just an incredible beer. My first of the festival and my last of the first day and my last of the second day too. I could not get enough. I know someone who was even more into it than me however. A certain Mrs Fonefan drank nothing but this on day two. She somehow remained impressively sober too. Bloody brilliant!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1470,"2008-08-13",4.2,"Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - GBBF2008. A dark brown coloured beer.  Big alcohol on the nose including a rummy feel.  Thick gloopy alcohol flavours.  Vinuous to a fault.  Notes of bourbon it seems.  Very full bodied and tasty.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
1470,"2008-08-12",4.3,"Wooden cask, GBBF 08. Jet black, thin shortlived beige head and low condition. Chocolate and bitter coffe beans, some fruitiness and a hint of spirits in the nose, full sweetness in the mouth initially but becoming woody and earthy with a slight bitterness developing, slight fruity spiciness in the finish but a lingering woody earthiness takes over with some retronasal whisky spirit notes.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"

1470,"2008-08-12",3.8,"Cask at GBBF 2008   Pours black with a thin rim of tan bubbles sticking to the edge. This has a real deep bitterness but backed up with some citrussy hops. This is lovely thick complex sweet chocolate, coffee but also quite softened because of the oak ageing nice vanilla pushing through, a lovely beer that is just a bit too much for me but I can see why others loved this.","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
1470,"2008-08-09",4.2,"Great big wooden cask at GBBF 08 :) Pure black, still. Long before you get the beer into your mouth, you know this is going to command respect. The nose has stewed fruits, wood smoke, salty liquorice, coffee, molasses and malt. On the tongue, cocoa, dark fruits and tarry flavours are apparent. It’s so intense, the aroma stings your nose as you swallow. The oily texture coats the mouth and it slips down smoothly. A beer to drink slowly and give your full attention to.","Los Angeles, California, USA","Ethereal"

1470,"2008-08-08",4.2,"Cask at GBBF 08.  From a great big cask just like the one in the photo.  Vanilla hits you first.  Its an oily impy stout in the mouth.  It’s a very intense beer, makes the hall go quiet and focusses you in onto this beer.  Alcohol isn’t obvious in the mouth, but blows your legs away.  This really is stunning.  Strong, overwhelming and great.  Drinkability?  Perhaps not all the time, but as a finishing beer?  Oh boy, one of the best.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
1470,"2008-08-07",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2009 Cask at GBBF 08. Some said this was best of the festival. Very dark brown. Sweet buttery caramel aroma. Oily, smooth mouthfeel; vinous, slightly musty cocoa taste that came on dusty sunbeams from a well-contented childhood. Sweet and beguiling. A little bitterness crept in, as it always does with the passing of the years. Delightful. 25.12.09 Bottle #35 gratefully received from Fin. Many thanks. I couldnt add anything to the above rating. A little leather in the taste perhaps? Slightly fizzier than the cask? Rating: 8,3,8,4,16:3.9","Bedford, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","hughie"
