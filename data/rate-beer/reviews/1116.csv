1116,"2016-07-23",4.1,"2013 / Blend 3 Bottle: Pour is murky red / mahogany with a modest, pinkish white head that dissipates fairly quickly into this glass, leading to a light ring. Theres some feint spotting presence on this one. The nose is jammy as hell - mixed into this is lemon grass notes and an undercurrent of funk that I wasnt expecting either. It is my first Jester King sour - theres a general profile adjust here. Taste : Tart sour notes with a heavier dose of lemon zest and rind, coupled with grassy notes and that sweet raspberry jam and seeds rounding that out. Theres simply a nice level of complexity to this beer. its bright, its somewhat acidic, yet perfectly sweet - yet perfectly funky and perfectly tart - with a dry completion. I can see what all the fuss is about on this one, and this is coming from someone that has zero appreciation for the jester king standard lineup.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

The taste is is layers of raspberry jam, tart, funky raspberry center with a mildly sharp oak toward the finish. The texture is interesting. It starts jammy and turns bone dry from the oak barrel. The barrel is starting to take over and the sourness is starting to win over the awesome raspberry jam character. 
 I got say this is a beautiful beer and since I am not a huge sour fan, this rides the line of having the barrel and funk take over. Perfect time to open the 2015 (before it becomes to sour). The layers of fresh berry mixed with sour/tart berries is something special.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

Very deep red pour, almost purple, with a neat fizzy pink head that sadly sizzles away fast with no lacing. Otherwise pretty neato looking. Ive been sipping this for awhile now and contemplating it as it starts to warm slightly, and discussing with Mrs. Owl. Overall, I dig it. Sour, raspberry, it delivers. Now, lets dig deeper. Sourness hits my nose first, definitely sour, lactic, citric, raspberry, etc. Digging deeper, theres a sort of weird meatiness, and surprisingly, given the low-ish ABV, a touch of alcohol popping through. Drinking and sipping for a bit now, the sourness and the raspberry pops and lingers. Pretty tasty, but perhaps a little one dimensionally sour. Reminds me a bit of a chalky Smartie. Tannic, bitter, seedy aspect, jammy. That meaty aspect is hitting me again. Lingers dry and tart with a borderline fecal funkiness. Interesting, tasty.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

A - Pours ruby red with a nice one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace down parts of the glass. Goes pretty dead after about five minutes in the glass.


S - Smells of musty basement, bit of horse blanket funk, tart raspberry - both skin and pulp - oak, dash of sugar and a touch of lactic sourness. Berries are strong but so is the musty funk, really nice nose on this one. 


T - Starts off with the strong raspberry tartness quickly being joined by the basement must and barnyard funk. Hints of oak and some sugary sweetness help to keep it all in check. Finish is tart with some sweetness, drying the palate and lingering for awhile after consumption.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Tart, musty feel with some backing sweetness helping to keep it in check.

1116,"2013-12-08",4.5,"1900th review! Got in a trade with cyde. 500 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Blend 2, bottled in August 2013. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense pink head with poor retention, that reduces to a small ring of lacing. Minimal glass lacing and a fair amount streaming carbonation. Great color and clarity. Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raspberry skin, sour cherry, red grape, green apple, oak, clove, pepper, leather, red wine, vinegar, hay, straw, herbal, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big raspberry presence and great yeast/oak balance; with great strength. Taste of big tart raspberry, raspberry skin, green apple, sour cherry, pear, red grape, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, red wine, musty funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, green apple, red grape, pear, sour cherry, oak, clove, red wine, hay, straw, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of raspberry, oak, and yeast ester flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane raspberry sour ale! All around fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of raspberry, oak, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity.

Pretty pinkish purple. Massive sweet stewed raspberry nose, unbelievable. Taste is tart raspberry with nice tart acidity. Not terribly long, but pure, dry fruit, with some oak. Great but a bit of a let down after the nose in terms of complexity. Terrific beer regardless.

>>>Batch 4 in May 2015.  Again from my main man, Errl!  Bumping up rating from 4.1.  Massive fresh and jammy raspberry nose, some vegetal woody stems, light soft cheese aromas.  Taste follows, with woody elements really balancing out the pure fruit.  Much more complex than I remember Batch 1 being.  5 out of 5 preferred this to 3F Framboos in a tasting owing to the complexity.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
1116,"2013-12-01",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2015 [Bottle / Blend 1] Thanks, Nick! Blood red, deep crimson color, very dense & nearly opaque in the center with a lavish, lavender & pink colored head. Aroma explodes with juicy raspberry puree, jam essence with freshly pounded raspberries all around. Good sour vibe with some light lacto sharpness, faint acidity with a touch of residual sweetness for balance. Taste starts with dense raspberry; juicy & pureed. Starts off sweet, but grows with a mild acidity throughout, until you reach a sharp & tart finish. Very light notes of vinegar with a heavier balance of oak & wood. Mild acidity adds to the sharpness but wont tear your guts up. Awesome brew, never had raspberries this fresh & pure in a beer before.
[Blend 2] Had a bottle of Blend 2 & there was definitely a bit more stink cheese & sweatsock funk on the nose, which I loved. Still plenty of raspberry jammy jam goodness; pure, sour, fresh, light yogurt. A great raspberry wild ale.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
1116,"2013-11-29",4.1,"Bottle shared thanks to JBPortland for prying this out of a Texans hands ! Pours a deep rich ruby red color with a finger of pink foam. The nose is deep ripe raspberry jam, wet spicy oak funk and a touch of vinous musk. The palate follows with huge raspberry essence, not a whole lot of sweetness but more a ripe tart berry flavor with complexity added by some spicy oak notes with touches of vanilla and a puckering dryness to finish it off ! Pretty damn tasty.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

1116,"2013-11-25",4.0,"Bottle at Tony/Jim BA Birthday Extravaganza 2013 (Western Springs, IL). Pours a nice deep ruby reddish hue, crimson berry darkness with nice haziness. Frothy whitish pink head is mellow, a nice ring sticks around, laces ok. Aromas are rich raspberry, dark and pulpy with seedy fruit, lactic sourness, lemon, tart and enjoyable. Some gentle oak, touches of funk and cobwebs. Initial is tart, nicely sour with fruity raspberry, tart sourness meets some cobwebs, tannic raspberry skin, a bit seedy. The funkiness dies out, a bit darker and. Touchs weet in the middle. Backend is a bit pulpy, sweetn black raspberry juice with some cherry, touches of tartness taper out, a bit tannic, raspberry skin. A bit funky with some cobwebs, gentle lactic yogurty feel and berryskin as we finish. Nice stuff. Rich, flavorful, the cobwebs a bit firmer as we get into it. A touch pulpy, tannic.

1116,"2013-11-20",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2014 Bottle, Blend 2: August 2013. Aroma is full of seedy blackberries and fresh raspberry. There is a bit of an acidic note, but mostly very fruit forward with no funk. Can almost pick up on some oak. Pours a deep pink/purple with an attractive purple bubbly head. Nice head retention that sits on top of the liquid for quite awhile. Flavor follows aroma - with moderate acidity and medium raspberry jam notes. There is plenty of blackberry and dark grape notes in the flavor as well. The finish is fairly dry, with medium high carbonation, with a somewhat thin mouthfeel. Very sticky sweet candy notes lingers on the tongue. I find the flavors to be a little one dimensional with the absence of some kind of funk. The fruit sweetness kind of washes out the barrel or bug complexities that may have rounded out this beer for me. Overall a very enjoyable sour.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
1116,"2013-11-18",4.6,"Been holding off on rating this one for months, despite attending the release and having multiple draft & bottle pours of both batches. I do my best not to overuse hyperbole, and I don't want to be a homer, so I've waited to collect my thoughts before publishing them. It's time. 

Fresh raspberries pummel my nose far away from the bottle. Mildly oaked at the end, adding a touch of complexity to this already impressive aroma. My very first impression of smelling this brew was unknown to me at the bottle share before the release. It was handed to me in a glass, and I asked, ""Is this Cantillon?"" Yeah, it's THAT good. 

And the taste delivers. Waves of deliciously fresh raspberries bombard my taste buds, accented by a baseline oak character and hints of yeasty funk. Damn. I actually prefer this to St. Lamvinus. Wtf?! 

I may be a bit of a Freetail fanboy, but goddamn, this is nothing short of game-changing for Texas beer. And maybe American sours in general. I truly could not recommend this more highly, but my remaining bottles are simply not for trade. Atrial is one of the absolute best sours I've ever had. Cheers!","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
1116,"2013-11-18",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2013 (500ml bottle batch 1) exceptionally dark ruby red, pink bubbles. Nose of funk, raspberry purée, fresh field greens, red wine, Pedio. Taste of raspberry purée and seeds, tart but not puckering or sour, really complex and well done. 

Have had both blend 1 and blend 2. Im not sure which I prefer, I think theyre both unique. Blend 1 already feels like the more mature beer, and its no surprise since its 4+ months older but aging has already had an impact. Blend 1 is more complex, funky, and the brett is more forward. Blend 2 is much more fruit forward and smells and tastes more like fresh raspberries, rather than the seeds. I think if I was drinking a lot of it, blend 2 would be my preference. To sit and enjoy only one though, blend 1 would be my pick for the complexity factor.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

1116,"2013-10-12",3.9,"Batch #1 - March 2013.
Aroma is dominated by fresh raspberries with a light background funkiness. Light acidity. But this is really mostly jammy berry notes.Pours a dark red to purple with a big frothy pink head that slowly recedes to the edges. Light lacing and no legs. Flavor is initially a bit sweet with a lot of jam notes and that recedes and the acidity comes in. Not much funkiness to add complexity but light oak notes do help. Tartness is a bit one dimensional, but its clean. Slightly odd light bitterness in the finish.Mouthfeel is low to medium low with medium carbonation. Low acidic astringency and low alcohol warmth.Overall a pretty good raspberry American sour, but it lacks the complexity of a Belgian framboise. The aroma is better than the flavor.

1116,"2013-09-06",4.5,"Sampled both from a bottle pre-release and on tap at Jester King during the official bottle release. Truly exciting to experience Jester Kings first bottle release!

4 oz pour into a stemmed wine glass. Served around 50 degrees F and allowed to warm in the hot TX shade.

Appearance is the first thing that you notice about most beers. This brews radiant deep, ruby red hue is no exception. Theres no real head by the time I get my glass out the door and sit down to start considering its magnificence, but there are scattered whitish bubbles on the surface. Its worth mentioning again; the color is surreal and beautiful.

Smell is the beers weak point. Straight on raspberry with a hint of rubber and definite sourness. Thankfully the raspberry smell is pure fruit, no extract or synthetic. Still, not as rich as Id imagine.

Taste is outstanding. Ripe, tart deep red raspberries with a bracingly sour acidity. Imagine eating perfectly ripe raspberries atop homemade raspberry jam, then chasing with lacto and pedio souring bacteria that havent overkilled the product youre consuming. Thats what this is. Amazing raspberry clarity in the taste. I wish someone had brought a Rose de Gambrinus so I could try them side-by-side.

Mouthfeel is also outstanding. Fuller bodied than most sours, thanks (Im guessing) to the substantial fruit presence in the beer. This is nearly syrup-y in texture, which makes it more enjoyable in my opinion. Theres definite carbonation throughout.

All in all, this is Jester Kings maestro performance to date. Call me a homer, but Ive traveled and consumed Rose de Gam at its source in Brussels and I think this beer is on par. In terms of TX beer, papas got a brand new bag.","Texas, USA","bootsjohn"
