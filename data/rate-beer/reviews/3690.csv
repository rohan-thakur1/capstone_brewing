3690,"2017-06-21",4.6,"This Old Ale was beyond easy to drink. I felt like I wasnt drinking it so much as watching it disappear all too quickly. Aroma is malty, candy-like, spicy, and fruity. Flavors of chocolate, toffee, and dark fruit with some touches of sassafras and vanilla that made me think of a root beer or cream soda - somehow those influences didnt seem at all out-of-place in the rich flavor profile. This Old Ale drank smooth, but Im glad I shared it. This one could sneak up on you pretty easily.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

3690,"2017-03-11",4.0,"On tap at Bulldog NE with samalito. Served up in a 10oz snifter glass. Deep amber and copper color. Plenty of slight off white head. Bubblegum and sugars on the nose. Taste is predominantly sweet with brown sugar and a dark fruit presence. Syrupy. Mouthfeel is slightly thin but has a bit of a bite. Definitely feels heavy on alcohol with a dangerous sweetness that lulls you into a false sense of security. Nice crisp finish with plenty of malts. Very good effort.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

Taste was a mix of vanilla, caramel, dark fruit and plum with some sherry notes, more brown sugars, finishing boozy, sweet. Better in a few years Id wager, but good.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"

3690,"2016-12-07",3.8,"750 ml bottle from a trade. White wax top. Color is Deep ruby with thin bubbly head. Aroma is molasses, wood, sugar, earthy malt. 
Flavor shows mild booze but all the flavor is here. Toasted sassafras, molasses, toasted oak, light fruit hints, and ends on some earthy malts. Spicy notes. Medium body with softer carbonation level. I think if this would have sat another 3- 4 months it would be optimal. However, right now it is pretty good.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3690,"2016-12-06",3.9,"Bomber bottle, from July. Right upon the pour, I can see that this beer should be enjoyed now, unless you have extra bottles to lay down. The malt is quite strong on the nose, and the sassafras in the smell could turn to a ""medicinal"" phenol in a few years time. Youll only see the foam right after you pour, as it settles down quickly, like most strong beers.
No phenol in the taste, though. Its a throwback to certain barley wines, with a lighter roast malt, and not as much hops as some barley wines start with. I thought the aging on sassafras would give it kind of a root beer patina, but luckily thats only in the smell and its not that much present on the palate. Rather than the sherry the label proclaims, Im looking at a light bourbon texture, with the wood adding a touch of vanilla. There is plenty of sweetness remaining that could further ferment out if theres any yeast left in the bottle. But as I pour the past bit from the bottle, I found that the bottom is clean, so there is likely not much yeast left to alter the taste.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3690,"2016-11-27",3.6,"Not up to the usual Surly style. Not bad but not great. Lots of esters in aroma. Flavors more sweet than bitter. Overall its not bad but compared to what their capable of, its somewhat of a let down.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"

3690,"2016-11-03",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 4, 2016 Bottle drunk 10/21/16.Apple juice colored body has rosy orange hues and shows high clarity. Beige head atop is initially large and falls to cover rapidly.Very interesting nose contains cinnamon, vanilla, dried apple, honey, caramel and the spicy sassafrass notes. A bit of earthiness to it, as well, with warming alcohol tones and a hugely fruity finish replete with caramel, raisin and more apple character.Sweet, rich and thick in the mouth, it has a very malty, soft texture with low to moderate carbonation, fairly engaging. Theres a strong attempt at balancing the malt, coming from adjunct acidity and the strong alcohol. Tastes very much like its apple brandy barrel-aged, even though it isnt, which is very impressive. Spicy sassafras, orange marmalade, vanilla and apple linger with big caramel and honey malt notes and very warming, somewhat sharp at times, alcohol. Very unique and interesting, just needs A LOT more time to mellow. Rating is more on potential in a few years than this actual experience.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Full bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste added to these notes, boozy warmth, and a bit of oakiness that conveyed some tannic astringency to the mellow but assertive bitterness.

3690,"2016-07-07",3.6,"4 oz. pour, on tap at Surly Beer Hall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 7-1-16. Medium brown. Moderate amount of beige head. Hazy liquid. Amber to reddish hue. Looks good. Sweet, juicy, caramel aroma. Tangy plum smell. Red grape scent. Surprisingly dry flavor. Yes, it is malty and there is a caramel element, but a cracker-dusty dryness dominates, especially in the finish. Booze noticeable. Prune. Some root beer from the sassafras. Bitter herbs. Evokes a carnival in its slightly twisted sweetness and its bitter remnants. Lively in the palate. Full body. Substantial. This is clearly a well-made beer. I dont love it, because it doesnt fall into my palate preferences, but I do like it. I think some age to tone down the heat will benefit it, but it may make it too sweet.
