"191","360","7,155",19,5,"1,980","26624","Jester King 2016 SPON Methode Gueuze","Our first brew was a turbid mash of 60% malted barley and 40% raw Texas wheat. We followed the mash schedule found in Jeff Sparrow's Wild Brews. The first runnings were very starchy. We boiled the wort for four hours with hops aged in burlap bags in the attic of our horse barn. 
 
We transferred the entire batch of wort to a ~15 barrel coolship we had fabricated out of stainless steel. We let the wort cool overnight exposed to airborne yeast and bacteria. The next day, we racked the cooled wort to oak puncheons without pitching any yeast or bacteria. We then waited patiently to see if anything would happen. 
 
After about a week, and much to our amazement, the wort started to ferment. Early on, the beer was very harsh, astringent, and bitter. It had an unpleasant grainy character, smelled like cooked corn, and was very turbid. The only thing that gave us hope at that point, was the beer still tasted pretty ??clean?? despite the astringency and noticeable off-flavors. But then, after about six months, we noticed a transformation. The grainy, cooked corn aroma gave way to a very pleasant musty attic, barnyard scent. The bitterness still lingered, but the astringency had mellowed. We could tell the beer was slowly becoming more refined as it aged. This gave us hope ?? enough hope that we were encouraged to try spontaneous fermentation again the following winter. 
 
The winter of 2014 marked our second coolship season. Unlike our first season in 2013, where we only did two 15 barrel batches, we did around a dozen coolship brews the second season. Fermentation was vigorous, and the beer overall was less bitter and more sour than 2013. We believe this had to do with decreasing our hopping rate for our second season. We used around 0.75 pounds per barrel of hops rather than 1.25 pounds per barrel. We also think our aged hops had less bitterness after another full year aging in the attic of the horse barn. 
 
Our third coolship season began in January, 2015. By this point, we were pretty confident the wort would spontaneously ferment and slowly mature over time. We felt we hit our sweet spot in terms of our hopping rate, settling around one pound per barrel. Balancing acidity is a critical part of what we do, and we really like the soft, restrained acidity from our 2015 coolship season. 
 
Finally, in February of 2016 we created our first blend! We took ten percent beer from 2013, thirty percent beer from 2014, and sixty percent beer from 2015, blended it, then packaged it in bottles and kegs. We did not pitch any yeast or bacteria at the time of bottling, but rather relied on the microbes still alive in the beer for refermentation. We did however add a dose of priming sugar at the time of packaging. We experimented with refermenting the blend using the residual sugar in the younger beer. However, this technique did not produce the level of carbonation we wanted. We refermented the bottles on their sides. Not only is this true to the traditional method of Gueuze, but we've become huge proponents of shallow vessel fermentation on a sensory level. 
 
The three year blend has been slowly maturing in bottles since February, 2016 and will be nine months old at the time of release. Extended refermentation and maturation in the serving vessel is another technique that's true to the method of Gueuze, which we find absolutely critical. A lot of the funky, basement cellar, musty attic aromas that we love simply are not present at the time of blending and need time in the bottle to develop. In our opinion, there is no substitute for extended refermentation / maturation for beers of this style.",6,180,NA,50,99,75,NA,"Lambic Style - Gueuze","Sour","Jester King Brewery","Brew Pub/Brewery","Austin","TX","78736","USA",30.245558,-97.94177

We began our sour ale project in 2006 with only four oak barrels previously used to store red wine. The number has grown over the years, along with the amount of sour ale we've brewed. Each barrel develops unique characteristics as it ferments independently, and just as Belgian brewers have been doing for centuries, we sought out our favorite barrels, ranging in age from one to three years old, for blending. By blending the sour ale from these barrels together in various amounts, we created in this bottle a live harmony of tartness, fruitiness and layers of flavor that can never be replicated. We hope you enjoy it with friends, whenever and wherever.

The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood.

Scotch Ales are some of the world's most flavorful beers. Scotland's cold, blustery climate lends itself to the growing of barley and oats, but not to the production of hops, which are almost always added sparingly.
 
The yeast must work at cooler temperatures than is customary for ales, resulting in maltier, cleaner, less fruity or estery, beers. The color often comes from black roasted malt, which imparts some dryness, but because of the lower attenuation and hopping rates, Scottish ales are almost always slightly sweet and incredibly drinkable.
 
Ours was brewed with black roasted barley, biscuit and peat-smoked malt. It was gently hopped, fermented cool and aged cold for weeks for smoothness. It is copper-brown in color, with some sweet maltiness and plenty of body.

He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland, and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a 'light' Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these pieces, his political or civil commentary is often at its most blunt. 
 
He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement and after his death became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism. 
 
As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland, often revising or adapting them. His poem (and song) Auld Lang Syne is often sung at Hogmanay (New Year), and Scots Wha Hae served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well-known across the world today, include A Red, Red Rose, A Man's A Man for A' That, To a Louse, To a Mouse, The Battle of Sherramuir, and Ae Fond Kiss. 
 
Every January, Barley's Smokehouse & Brewpub hosts its Robert Burns Dinner and Robert Burns Scottish Export Ale Tapping to celebrate his birthday and ato toast to His Immortal Memory.

The citrus and floral aromas are from the four varieties of hops. The ruby red hues and peppery flavors are a result of using some red rye malt in the mash.  We hopped it up with Columbus, Centennial, Chinook and Willamette hops for an aggressive hop finish.

We made our Hopped Rye with the finest Two Row barley and red rye malt, plenty of hops, pure Moab water and house ale yeast.

There is an old saying in Japan, ??There are ten thousand ways to make sake.??
CBC is very proud to introduce number ten thousand and one.

Banryu Ichi (10,001 ways in Japanese) is an experimental brew that straddles the line between beer and sake. Produced in collaboration with our good friend and masterful sake home-brewer, Todd Bellomy, this has been one of the most interesting and labor-intensive beers ever to come out of CBC.

We began last December by spending many cold, windy days in the alley behind the brewery, steaming rice in small batches to brew what became almost fifty gallons of pure sake. Sake is produced by multiple parallel fermentation: polished rice is converted to sugar by a fungus called Koji (Aspergillus oryzae) and fermentation is taken care of by sake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae kyokai). After several weeks of fermentation this batch of sake (possibly the largest batch of sake ever made in New England) was destined to become the starter for our beer.

Just after Christmas, Todd joined us again to brew a mere six barrels of the craziest beer wort ever. Pale barley malt and flaked rice went into the mash, and after extracting only the first runnings we added a significant amount of brown rice syrup. This yielded a wort of 31*P/1.124SG, or in other words, some really thick, sticky stuff! The wort was sent to the fermenter and then, with fingers crossed, we pumped over the entire batch of sake including the yeast, Koji, and lots of rice slurry. Fermentation was slow and low at 50*F for six weeks, followed by cold-conditioning until it reached more than 15%abv!

Incredibly complex aromas and flavors abound, including sweet rice, fresh apples and grapes, hints of earth and mushroom from the koji, and as it warms further notes of fennel, herbs, and an almost Belgian-yeast spiciness. Brilliant copper-colored, it is full in body despite its very dry finish. This is one to be sipped, savored, and contemplated. Banryu Ichi is a truly unique beverage, served with intentionally very low carbonation in a 5oz. glass set inside a Masu, a traditional cedar sake cup.
Kampai!

Inspired by the brewing tradition of our flagship, Anchor Steam?? Beer, Brotherhood Steam Beer is brewed with its own unique recipe. A distinct malt bill gives the beer its copper color, and dry-hopping with Citra and Nelson Sauvin hops adds aromatic hints of citrus and mint. The result is a smooth, full-bodied malt flavor with a lingering, fresh hop finish.

A long-standing English brewery tradition is to designate their beers, ??Ordinary??, ??Best or Special??, and ??Extra Special Bitter?? (ESB) to note beers of increasing strength.

In the spirit of that tradition, we like to think of Brotherhood Steam Beer as an Extra Special Lager (ESL), aka ??The Gig Beer?? ?? an easy drinking brew from the first set to encore. This collaborative brew will be tapped at music venues across the US to celebrate the Brotherhood's new album.

Anchor Steam?? Beer owes its deep amber color, thick, creamy head, and rich, distinctive flavor to a historic brewing process like none other.

It is a process that combines deep respect for craft brewing tradition with many decades of evolution to arrive at a unique approach: a blend of pale and caramel malts, fermentation with lager yeast at warmer ale temperatures in shallow open-air fermenters, and gentle carbonation in our cellars through an all-natural process called kr??usening. 

Anchor Steam?? Beer derives its unusual name from the 19th century when ??steam?? was a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of America under primitive conditions and without ice. While the origin of the name remains shrouded in mystery, it likely relates to the original practice of fermenting the beer on San Francisco's rooftops in a cool climate. In lieu of ice, the foggy night air naturally cooled the fermenting beer, creating steam off the warm open pans. Once a nickname for any Californian or West Coast beer brewed under these conditions, today the name ??steam?? is a trademark of Anchor Brewing and applies only to the singular process and taste of our flagship brand - San Francisco's original Anchor Steam?? Beer. The classic of American brewing tradition since 1896.",4.9,147,NA,3781,66,93,NA,"California Common","Pils/Lager","Anchor Brewing Company","Microbrewery","San Francisco","CA","94107","USA",37.766529,-122.39577

Seven Kingdoms Hoppy Wheat Ale, the newest beer in the Game of Thrones series from HBO Global Licensing and Brewery Ommegang, is slated to debut this spring ahead of the premiere of season six of HBO's critically-acclaimed and Emmy award-winning show. The brew will be available all throughout the realm ?? the United States that is ?? both on draft and in large-format 750ml bottles. 
 
Seven Kingdoms is a marriage of a traditional Belgian-style wheat and a hop-forward American ale ?? but unlike so many of the marriages on the show, the resulting hoppy wheat is pleasant, playful and inspired. At 6.9% ABV, it possesses a nuanced complexity that pairs nicely with the hop-forward characteristics that make it surprisingly refreshing. 

??We love bringing as much inspiration, thoughtfulness and creativity to the Game of Thrones beers as we can,?? said Mike McManus, Innovation Manger at Brewery Ommegang. ??This last season, the imaginativeness of the show was pretty astounding so we aimed for a beer that could hope to match that. A fusion of two wonderful styles was an idea that really excited our team.?? 

??With Seven Kingdoms, Ommegang has crafted another excellent brew which we know our fans will love,?? said Josh Goodstadt, Vice President of Global Licensing at HBO. ??The world of Westeros is varied and complex and this varietal embodies those characteristics while offering a new and unique taste to beer drinkers.?? 

Seven Kingdoms pours a hazy pale yellow with a thick cap of pure white foam. The aroma is floral, citrusy with a touch of passion fruit and a slightly herbal hop aroma underpinned with yeast notes of banana, ripe fruit, and spicy phenols. The taste is a full, round hop flavor with tart orange and lemon with a substantial wheat maltiness and the finish has slightly lingering hop notes without being harshly bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth and silken owing to the wheat and oats. 

The new brew is hopped with Bravo, Centennial, Citra, Cascade, and Columbus, and brewed with pilsner, white and red wheat, oats, and a touch of sugar to lighten the body.

Goose Island could have thrown a party.  But we did something better.  We brewed a beer.  A really big batch of stout-so big the malt was coming out of the top of the mash tun.  After fermentation we brought in some bourbon barrels to age the stout.  One hundred and fifty days later, Bourbon County Stout was born-A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with a thick foam the color of bourbon barrels.  The nose is a mix of charred oak, vanilla,carmel and smoke.  One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.  It overpowers anything in the room.  People have even said that it's a great cigar beer, but I haven't yet tried a cigar that would stand up to it.""  Brewmaster Greg Hall;

Editor's Note: Baudoinia Fulton & Wood Series offering (And the Low Storage entry from FoBAB 2012) is simply Bourbon County Stout aged in the same barrels. It has been alted as it offers no different recipe or barrel type simply the presence of a distillers fungus on the barrels that adds no distinct characteristic to the beer from the fungus itself except for possible oxygen exposure changes. While Brewers Intent indicates that they consider it a new beer, no true distinction aside from this oxidation amount and possible aging time differences separates the beers. It's essentially a single barrel Bourbon County version something we have always treated as regular Bourbon County Stout in the past.",13.9,417,60,2868,100,100,NA,"Imperial Stout","Stout","Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev)","Commercial Brewery","Chicago","IL","60612","USA",41.880682,-87.6877

Nearly without exception, the darker, richer and more alcoholic a brew is, the warmer the serving temperature should be.

This isn't to suggest that very long periods of maturation in oak automatically lead to good beer. Far from it. In fact, some of our favorite beers we've made have achieved some really nice characteristics in just a few months. However, we're really pleased with the way Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite turned out and are happy it received all the time it did.

The base beer for Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed in 2013. After maturing in oak barrels for about a year, it was blended during the spring of 2014 and refermented with raspberries. It was then racked to a single 500 liter Spanish sherry barrel for further aging and maturation. In July of 2015, fifteen months later, we racked the beer out of the sherry barrel and bottled it. All together, Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite took a little over two years to make. Again, this isn't to suggest that long periods of fermentation and maturation necessarily equate to enjoyable beer, but in this case, we think it does.

Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of microorganisms consisting of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery, and refermented with raspberries grown in Washington. Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was pakagd in July of 2015 and is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned. At the time of bottling, it was 7.0% alcohol by volume, 1.003 specific gravity (0.75 degrees Plato), 7 IBU, and 3.3 pH.

Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the 
world's best barley- and hop-growing regions, and is distinguished by an ample supply of top-
quality water.

Our Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, Cara-
Aroma, CaraMunich and de-husked Carafa malts to an original gravity of 22?? Plato.  The malts 
provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with 
a hint of smoke.  It is lightly spiced with German Hallertau Tradition hops and fermented with 
lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich.  In the traditional manner, Double Vision 
is fermented cold (48??F) and lagered a full 12 weeks for smoothness.  At 8.0% alcohol by 
volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.

The 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly 
fasts.  They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called ??liquid bread?? and 
named ??Holy Father?? to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts.  The beer was known 
as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager.  Since ??bock?? also means ??billy goat?? in German, 
these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats.  

Double Vision's slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match 
for game??venison, moose, duck, goose, and wild boar??especially when prepared with fruity 
sauces or reductions.  Try it with pork and saut??ed apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet 
sausages, ham or prosciutto.  It's wonderful with cheese and dessert, too.  Pair it with an aged

Simple Means takes inspiration from Altbier. Though classically associated with the copper ales of D??sseldorf, the term can refer to any older-style beer in the German-speaking world. Both the use of smoked malts and mixed fermentation with native yeast and bacteria predate modern brewing techniques, lending flavors to our farmhouse altbier that are evocative of a simpler, much earlier time.

Simple Means was brewed with unfiltered, raw, Hill Country well water, malted barley, smoked malted barley, and hops in early September of 2015. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery in stainless steel for about two months.

"916","1,861","5,787",31,5,"39,965","19559","Grand Teton Lazy Marmot Maibock","In Germany, strong lagers are called ??bocks?? or ??bock biers.?? There is some dispute over the origin of the designation. ??Bock?? in German also means goat, and that animal often appears on labels as a symbol of the style. Some say bocks are brewed for the season of Capricorn, which includes Christmas, while others say that the beer has the ??kick of a goat.??
 
The historically-minded among us at Grand Teton like to credit the style originators, the people of Einbeck, in northern Germany. The beers that gave Einbeck the nickname, ??City of Beer??, were first brewed in the 14th and 15th centuries. They were brewed very strong because they were sent long distances, fermenting on the way. Before long, Einbeck, pronounced Ein-bock by the southerners of Bavaria, became famous for its strong beers, which came to be known simply as ??bocks.??
 
Einbeck is a beautiful medieval city, architecturally distinctive for the one story--or taller--arches that grace each house. These arches allowed entry of the town brew kettle, which passed from house to house according to a lottery held each year on May 1st. A pale bock brewed to commemorate the lottery became the city's most celebrated beer??Maibock.
 
Our version is squarely in the Einbeck tradition. We used Idaho 2-Row Pale along with German Vienna and CaraHell malts for a clean, slightly sweet flavor, then subtly spiced the brew with German Tradition hops. We fermented with lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich and allowed it to ferment and condition for more than three months for a smooth yet crisp character.
 
Try Lazy Marmot Maibock as an aperitif to stimulate the taste buds, or with any flavorful fish, such as trout or salmon.

The inspiration for Repos?? came from dusty, hay-filled barns like the one near Jester King where we store our aged hops. We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Repos?? was Bi??re de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bi??re de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Repos?? was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. 

The wort for Repos?? was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King's unique mixed culture of brewer's yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. After an initial fermentation in stainless steel, Repos?? was then slowly fermented for months in Brandy barrels we received from France. It is 8.3% alcohol by volume, 12 IBU, has a finishing gravity of 1.004, and was 3.25 pH at the time of bottling.

"1033","2,062","7,155",75,5,"1,980","26624","Jester King / Arizona Wilderness Brewing Buford??s Roadside Wares","We're excited to announce the release of Buford's Roadside Wares ?? our collaboration with Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co.! Buford's Roadside Wares was brewed with pecans and wheat from both Texas and Arizona, inoculated with native yeast and bacteria in our coolship, and fermented in brandy barrels previously containing Jester King Repos??. The recipe was inspired by the Franco-Belgian farmhouse tradition of Bi??re de Garde.

Back in January of 2015, Jonathan Buford and Patrick Ware of Arizona Wilderness traveled to Jester King to brew with us on a freezing cold day. The temperature was about 15 degrees Fahrenheit when they showed up at the brewery. They brought with them some Arizona pecans and Sonora White Wheat, which we combined with Texas pecans and raw wheat. We brewed a medium gravity wort with pecans in the mash and fuggle hops in the boil, and knocked the wort out into our coolship. From there, the wort cooled overnight and was inoculated with native yeast and bacteria from the Texas Hill Country. The next morning, we drained the wort out of our coolship, pitched it with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria, and then racked it into brandy barrels for fermentation.

Buford's Roadside Wares was our ??momentum batch?? for 2015. At the outset of each coolship season, we brew a momentum batch designed to get the airborne yeast and bacteria at the brewery ??woken up??. Basically, we put out some food for the yeast (fresh wort) and allowed it to get all riled up for spontaneous fermentation. The idea of kickstarting spontaneous fermentation season with a ??momentum batch?? comes from the baking/bread world, and was recommended to us back in 2013 by our friends at Allagash Brewing Co. We've been conducting a momentum batch every year since 2014, and we've noticed how the microbial momentum builds throughout our coolship season. The pace at which spontaneous fermentation begins, and the vigor with which it proceeds, intensifies as the season wears on. Buford's Roadside Wares got the momentum going for our 2015 coolship season! After accomplishing that task, we pitched the cooled wort with our mixed culture, rather than allowing it to ferment spontaneously.

Buford's Roadside Wares was brewed on January 8th, 2015 with raw well water, malted barley, raw wheat, pecans, and hops. It was fermented in brandy barrels for 12 months prior to packaging on January 25th, 2016. The beer was 100% naturally conditioned by refermentation in bottles, kegs, and casks. Around the time of packaging, it was 6.4% alcohol by volume, 3.2 pH, 13 IBU, and had a finishing gravity of 1.002 (0.5 degrees Plato).",6.4,192,13,57,90,97,NA,"Bi??re de Garde","Pale Ale","Jester King Brewery","Brew Pub/Brewery","Austin","TX","78736","USA",30.245558,-97.94177

Additional Information:

The Oktoberfest in Munich started in 1810 as a celebration of the

wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese. The festival

was such a hit that it turned into an annual event celebrated for 16

days from late September to early October. Oktoberfest beer comes

from the Marzen style. These beers were bigger, richer beers

brewed in March and stored in caves during the hot months of

summer. In the fall, they were enjoyed at the Oktoberfest

The beer was then laid down in ice filled caves until the following harvest in September and October, when it would be greatly enjoyed at harvest festivals. It emerged bronze and incomparably smooth with a round and slightly sweet palate, with an almost spicy flavor complemented by a deep toffee like aroma. The Marzen beer which means ""March Beer"", has an appetizing bitterness that serves to balance rather than challenge the malt underpinnings. At a strength of about 5.5-6.0 percent, it's a slightly stronger than Pilsner, but not as strong as a Bock beer. The balance between a bread like, malty, juicy sweetness and a firm bitterness makes traditional Marzen one of the most tantalizing of beers. The smoothness is created from extra long cold conditioning of 2-6 months!

Released: August 18, 2012

Liner Notes
We've never released a Bourbon Barrel version of our Judgment Day. So we thought it might be interesting to take the base beer for Cuvee de Tomme age in first fill Bourbon Barrels and let mother nature take over. Of course, because this is a Rock and Roll inspired Box Set beer, we couldn't just leave well enough alone.
Upon sampling the base beer, it became apparent that the raisins used to brew the base beer were going to drive the flavor bus of this beer. The conversations turned to Oatmeal Raisin cookies and the essence of a freshly baked treat. So we added some cinnamon sticks to the barrels and threw in some dried chiles as well.

A scotch ale that is a scotch ale no more. Leaving its Scottish roots long behind in the summer of 2010, the ale adventured out to find its own way. Belgian influences from a host of micro-organisms have soured this once sweet behemoth. 
 
Hints of fig, plum and tart cherries occur naturally; the result of its unique fermentation. Over time, Le Fat has softened and mellowed while gaining refinement and character through extended aging in Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet barrels.

Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the 
world's best barley- and hop-growing regions, and is distinguished by an ample supply of top-
quality water.

Our Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, Cara-
Aroma, CaraMunich and de-husked Carafa malts to an original gravity of 22?? Plato.  The malts 
provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with 
a hint of smoke.  It is lightly spiced with German Hallertau Tradition hops and fermented with 
lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich.  In the traditional manner, Double Vision 
is fermented cold (48??F) and lagered a full 12 weeks for smoothness.  At 8.0% alcohol by 
volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.

The 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly 
fasts.  They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called ??liquid bread?? and 
named ??Holy Father?? to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts.  The beer was known 
as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager.  Since ??bock?? also means ??billy goat?? in German, 
these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats.  

Double Vision's slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match 
for game??venison, moose, duck, goose, and wild boar??especially when prepared with fruity 
sauces or reductions.  Try it with pork and saut??ed apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet 
sausages, ham or prosciutto.  It's wonderful with cheese and dessert, too.  Pair it with an aged 
gruy??re, a caramel flan, or a cr??me br??l??e.",8,240,40,130,98,99,NA,"Doppelbock","Bock","Grand Teton Brewing Co.","Brew Pub/Brewery","Victor","ID","83455","USA",43.636332,-111.14842

Miche Bread, which is owned and baked by Sandeep Gyawali, is truly delicious and inspiring. We felt an immediate kinship with Sandeep upon learning about his process. He mills his flour in-house using heritage grains, and he allows the bread to naturally leaven for several days with native yeast and bacteria, thereby creating all sorts of interesting flavors and aromas. Given our own use of Texas barley and wheat, and our spontaneous fermentation with native microbes, we knew we had to work with Sandeep somehow. Making a Kvass together seemed like a natural fit. Kvass is a low alcohol fermented beverage made with bread. It has been around in Eastern Europe for centuries.

We brewed Kvass with Sandeep at Jester King on July 19, 2016 with well water, malted barley from Blacklands Malt, malted rye, hops, and 140 pounds of Miche Bread in the mash. We then fermented the low gravity wort (1.023 / 6.0 Plato) in stainless steel with our mixed culture of brewers yeast, native yeast, and native bacteria. We then packaged Kvass on August 22, 2016 and allowed it to naturally referment in bottles and kegs. At the time of packaging, Kvass was 3.4 percent alcohol by volume, 25 IBU, 4.2 pH, and had a gravity of 1.002 (0.5 Plato). The label art was created by Josh Cockrell of Jester King.

 This sad holiday season we didn't have the brewing capacity to make our favorite seasonal brew, the widely feared BrownShugga' Ale. You see we had a couple of really good years (thank you very much) and so heading into this season while we are awaiting the January delivery of a new brewhouse we are jammin' along brewing 80 barrels of IPA and PILS and such every 3 hours. A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga' every 5 hours, that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga' brewed, we'd short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It's a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It's a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga' this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever. We freaking munch moldy donkey butt and we just want it to be all over...  So this substitute beer is a ??Cereal Medley' of Barley, Rye, Wheat, and Oats??.

Today, we're proud to craft the Official Bicentennial Beer of Astoria.
Many West Coast brewers in the 19th century had no ice, so they improvised an effervescent beer by brewing lager yeasts at higher-than-normal temperatures. Described as a ??refreshing drink, much consumed by the laboring classes,?? it's the inspiration for 1811 lager.
 
More flavorful than most modern lagers, and fermented at warmer temperatures, 1811 is lovingly concocted from 2 row malted barley and cracked maize; corn was a popular beer ingredient in pre-Prohibition days. 1811's hop character gives it a distinctive Northwest style worthy of Astoria's 200-year history.

ABV: 13.7%
Released: August 18, 2012

Liner Notes
We've never released a Bourbon Barrel version of our Judgment Day. So we thought it might be interesting to take the base beer for Cuvee de Tomme age in first fill Bourbon Barrels and let mother nature take over. Of course, because this is a Rock and Roll inspired Box Set beer, we couldn't just leave well enough alone.
Upon sampling the base beer, it became apparent that the raisins used to brew the base beer were going to drive the flavor bus of this beer. The conversations turned to Oatmeal Raisin cookies and the essence of a freshly baked treat. So we added some cinnamon sticks to the barrels and threw in some dried chiles as well.
At 13.70 ABV this beer has amazing depth of flavor and presents a unique drinking experience for consumers who may be seeking enlightenment on Judgment Day.",13.7,411,NA,330,100,99,NA,"Abt/Quadrupel","Strong Ale","Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey","Microbrewery","San Marcos","CA","92069","USA",33.144908,-117.17128

Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released. Beginning in 2010, ADBW will be released in late SEP.
 
In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.
 
Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.

From the first brash encounters, to the mellow complexity that age will bring, this is a beer to be savored early and then revisited with the passage of time. Share our tribute to friendships new and old.

 
The aroma starts with some malty, caramel notes like a sprinkling of brown sugar. Fruity overtones from the fermentation build on the inviting sweetness and add to the complexity. A bright hint of lemon from the hops tops it off.

Malty sweetness creates the first layer of flavor and on that foundation, fruity flavors of plums, pears and a touch of apple pie develop. The hops again serve to brighten the finish and add a balance to the malty sweetness .

Over time these flavors and aromas will deepen and continue to develop. Undertones of raisons, figs and prunes will add maturity and the hops will continue to soften until they become but a faint background for the sweet, fruitiness of the malts. Of course, that means you have to save some to find out!

Just as you might gently warm a winter brandy, let your barleywine come up to around 50-55?? to allow for the best appreciation of its flavors and aromas.

 
Old Backus gains complexity from a blend of American and English Pale Malts as well English Crystal Malt and Amber Malt. Generosity is the name of the game with just over 1/3 of a pound of malt in every pint

 
Where complexity serves in the malt bill, focus and simplicity is the key to our hops. Domestic Nugget and Crystal hops add some balancing bitterness and a hint of citrus to the aroma

This isn't to suggest that very long periods of maturation in oak automatically lead to good beer. Far from it. In fact, some of our favorite beers we've made have achieved some really nice characteristics in just a few months. However, we're really pleased with the way Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite turned out and are happy it received all the time it did.

The base beer for Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed in 2013. After maturing in oak barrels for about a year, it was blended during the spring of 2014 and refermented with raspberries. It was then racked to a single 500 liter Spanish sherry barrel for further aging and maturation. In July of 2015, fifteen months later, we racked the beer out of the sherry barrel and bottled it. All together, Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite took a little over two years to make. Again, this isn't to suggest that long periods of fermentation and maturation necessarily equate to enjoyable beer, but in this case, we think it does.

Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops. It was fermented with our mixed culture of microorganisms consisting of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery, and refermented with raspberries grown in Washington. Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was pakagd in July of 2015 and is unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned. At the time of bottling, it was 7.0% alcohol by volume, 1.003 specific gravity (0.75 degrees Plato), 7 IBU, and 3.3 pH.

You know, we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven't really stopped to ask ourselves, ??How did I get here?'.?? ~David Byrne
 

??Didn't I open this place to get away from these beers?????
~Phil ??Brewdaddy?? Bannatyne
 
Ironically named indeed, as in this case to remain in light would be to perpetuate appreciation of perhaps the most maligned beer style in the craft brewing world, the American Light Lager. Further, its name is an obvious reference to one of the late 20th Century's greatest albums by Talking Heads. A groundbreaking record, it pushed musical boundaries by blending American punk, funk, and early rap with Afrobeat's polyrhythms and lyrical inspiration from African literature, improvisation, and the cut-up method developed by Brion Gysin and Gil Wolman. Psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog called its front cover a ??disarming image, which suggests both splitting and obliteration of identity?? and which introduces the listener to the album's recurring theme of ??identity disturbance.??
 
Lest you fear the CBC Brew Crew is suffering a similar identity crisis, rest assured that we have full control of our faculties. The simple truth is that these beers are remarkably easy to drink and perfect for enjoying as we ride the cusp of summer-into-autumn weather. Moreso, while light lagers may be easy to create in the purpose-built industrial breweries across the land, they are very challenging to produce on a small-scale system like ours. And we are always up for a challenge.
 
Remain In Light is brewed with pilsner malt and flaked rice, hopped with Styrian Goldings, Saaz and Hallertauer, and fermented cold and lagered with the famous lager yeast from Augustiner. Bitterness and body are intentionally higher than typically found in those beers made by our macro contemporaries. Clean malty cereal grain sweetness is delicate but noticeable, while spicy herbal hop notes spread across the palate and linger through a bracing bitter finish. Our choice of serving glass, a 12 oz. flute, serves to keep the beer colder while preparing you for the second round. Hold this beer up to the light and ask yourself, ??Where does that highway lead to???

In 1876, thanks to an ice pond in the mountains and a belief that anything is possible in the Golden State, a little brewery named Boca created California's first genuine lager. Anchor California Lager?? is our re-creation of this historic American beer.

Made in San Francisco with two-row California barley, Cluster hops (the premier hop in 19th-century California), and our own lager yeast, this all-malt brew is kr??usened and lagered in our cellars. Its golden color, distinctive aroma, creamy head, balanced depth of flavor, and smooth finish make Anchor California Lager?? a delicious celebration of California's unique craft brewing heritage.

The California grizzly bear on our Anchor California Lager?? label is from a woodcut by Durbin Van Vleck (1833??1898), courtesy of The Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley. First published in 1856 in San Francisco, it is a superbly crafted rendering of an original illustration by Charles Christian Nahl (1818??1878), who had painted both eastbound and westbound versions of this bear. Nearly a century later, Nahl's bear served as inspiration for the design of the bear on California's modern state flag.

Today, only a few of the original structures still stand - ancient bricks, blocks and beams where the strength and scale of the brewery is still apparent. 

Our brewers were inspired by the handwritten 1901 recipe notes of THBC assistant brewer, Walter Braun. True to most pre-Prohibition American pilseners, CV continues to brewed with corn and malted barley and showcases both Cluster and Tettnang hops.  Cluster was the predominant American-grown hop in the Midwest at the turn of the century, and the Braun family came to the U.S. from the Tettnang region of Germany.

Its numeric moniker results from the old Belgian practice of naming beers based on the amount of malt used in the brew.  A ""Simple"" was the lightest-bodied brew.

To give The Dissident its characteristic sour taste the brewery used a wild yeast strain called Brettanomyces (also known as Brett) during fermentation. Known throughout the wine world for creating earthy undertones found in many European wines, Brett is used in the beer fermentation process to create strong flavors typically associated with Belgian beers. Unlike English varieties that use traditional inoculated yeasts in the fermentation process, beers made with Brett take much longer to ferment and require additional barrel finishing time to balance the sour flavoring. In the Dissident's case, this meant aging a portion of it in pinot and cabernet barrels for over 3 months. Another key flavor component comes from the Central Washington cherries that were added twelve months ago.
 
 
Due to the wild yeast , The Dissident required special treatment and was held in isolation under lock and key apart from the rest of the brewery's beers to avoid any cross-contamination. A secondary bottling line was also brought in from an outside contractor to facilitate The Dissident's bottling and insure the beer and wild yeast never touched the brewery's machinery.

With a beer this wild and truly unique, Deschutes needed a special label to alert consumers to what lay inside. The resulting image immediately sets The Dissident apart from the other Deschutes Brewery beers, even the Reserve Series beers.
 
 
The fruit and acidity in The Dissident make it ideal for pairing with a wide variety of dishes - the high acidity is perfect for cutting creamy dishes or cooling spicy ones. Because of the fruity characteristics derived from the cherries, the beer also pairs well with chocolate. Deschutes Brewery President and Founder Gary Fish recommends pairing the Dissident with ??anything chocolate, the darker the better, soft cheeses like Brie and creamy dishes like spaghetti carbonara, or macaroni and cheese.??
 
 
A very limited amount of The Dissident will be available September 1st as part of the brewery's Reserve Series in hand-waxed 22-ounce bottles...

The very first release of a Love Child blend was 100% soured Bourbon Barrel Quad, but each subsequent batch has included an increasing amount of Flanders-style red. For that reason, the strength has been steadily declining from the 12.5 ABV of Love Child No. 1 to more recent releases in the 8-9.5% range.  
Following primary fermentation with our house Belgian yeast strain, the component batches of beer were aged in a variety of whiskey and wine barrels as well as stainless steel tanks. Following aging in those vessels with lactobacillus and brettanomyces, samples were pulled from like lots and blended during a tasting session attended by brewers and members of our quality assurance team. With each release of a Love Child blend, it's not our intention to reproduce the character of the previous blend, but rather to offer a blend of the very best sour beers we have on hand. 

The blend for Love Child No. 7 breaks down as follows: 

Previously used red wine barrels ?? 48%
Previously used whiskey barrels ?? 30%
Stainless tanks ?? 22% 

The resulting beer was blended together in a bottling tank on our Smokestack Series bottling line and inoculated with brettanomyces and our bottle conditioning yeast strain. 

Pouring a slightly hazy, reddish amber hue, Love Child No. 7 opens with aromas of red fruit with a slight acidity detected. Lactobacillus provides a crisp, refreshing acidity with fruit, oak and subtle spice notes presenting in the flavor of the beer. Ending fermentation quite dry at 1.75 Plato, Love Child No. 7 tapers to a subtle oaky finish that begs for another sip. At 8.2 ABV and 9 IBUs, our latest Love Child blend is a perfect match for aged/funky cheese, desserts with fruit and tangy/citrusy salads.

Nearly without exception, the darker, richer and more alcoholic a brew is, the warmer the serving temperature should be.

Check-out all the complex layers crammed into an unassuming session ale: aromas and flavours of husky cereal grains, freshly-baked brown bread and almost burnt toast, nutty, biscuity, caramelly, faint roastiness, earthy and citrusy English hops, distinctive fruity ale yeast esters. Well-rounded and almost chewy mouthfeel, yet somehow still a crisp and light impression, with hints of mineral water drawn from Old World artesian wells. Great aftertaste too, richer as it warms. You won't find a fresher example of the style, so please, spread the word! If it doesn't catch on like it did in 18th-Century England, I'll eat my rotary phone. Note: I will not eat my phone.

The finish is full and oily, yet clean, with a light, modest bitterness.

No longer is it only an awareness among the faithful; the unconverted are beginning to feel it as well. Denial and ignorance are disappearing in favor of opened eyes, curiosity and the sense that there's something larger out there. For far too long we have been lied to. For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down-lowest-common-denominator-mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think we're talking only about the world of brewing, but we're not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breads...hell, there is stuff pretending to be 'food' that our great grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies can't dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted 'norms' over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, & mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too??????fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your children's children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that don't think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, it's up to you to decide. We hope you'll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight. Cheers to all we've accomplished together in the past fifteen years, and cheers to the adventure ahead!

Part 2 of a 4 beer collaboration between Cigar City, Hill Farmstead, and Grassroots.

A note from Joey Redner:  ""The beers are basically black IPA's brewed with lots of Citra, Mt. Rainier and Simcoe along with Ty Ty honey from North Florida aged on medium toast Spanish Cedar. There are different hop additions in the Hill Farmstead/Grassroots version (Or) and the 2-row base malt in the CCB version (Either) is replaced with Pilsner malt in the Vermont/Denmark version (Or). There are also some process differences which is one of the purposes of a collaboration; allowing breweries to learn from each other.

The goal was to make two beers that were alike, but slightly different due to preferences in regional approach and access to ingredients. The four beers in this collaborative series will be named: 

Either, Or, Neither and Nor. Either and Or will release first and the other two will follow.

Introducing the newest addition to Uinta Brewing Company's lineup, Dubhe (pronounced Doo-bee), an Imperial Black IPA. 
 
Dubhe was named after Utah's Centennial Star, a star classified as a Red Giant.  Dubhe, the star, appears orange in color, and is found at the top end of the big dipper's spoon. The name ??Dubhe?? continues Uinta's tradition of celebrating the great state of Utah, however, ??Dubhe?? is a fitting name for more than that reason: this beer is as black as the night sky and is brewed with an astronomical amount of hops.
 
 Dubhe is comprised of five hop varieties, a hop profile bold enough to shine through the roasted, dark malt character of this beer. A citrusy hop aroma, achieved by dry hopping with a proprietary blend of extreme Northwest hops, balanced with notes of mild dark chocolate and a hint of sweet licorice. Smooth from start to finish, Dubhe's layered flavor profile emerges with rich and rounded toasted malt flavors, and is followed by a lively hop bitterness. At over 5 pounds of hops per barrel, Dubhe is the most hop-laden beer Uinta has ever produced.

 This shinning new addition is brewed with hemp seed (A play on the name, perhaps?), and has a far-out ABV of 9.2%.",9.2,276,NA,834,98,98,NA,"Black IPA","IPA","Uinta Brewing Company","Brew Pub/Brewery","Salt Lake City","UT","84104","USA",40.750628,-111.94077

We've discovered that the Lagunitas brewers are part time alchemists... they've figured out how to keep wet hops wet all freakin' year long! The next beer in our 2016 #OneHitter Series is this Born Again Yesterday Pale Ale, which features a delicious concoction of wet hops, reborn and unfiltered into our Born Yesterday Pale Ale. Congrats... It's a beer again!
 
MORE ABOUT THE FREAKIN' WET HOPS:

To figure out this brand new wet hop preservation process, we had to forget everything that we already knew about how hops are processed and preserved. We tried 5 or 6 different things to try and achieve this process (some of which failed miserably), then we discovered a relatively simple process that deliberately did all the things that the textbooks told us not to do.
 
This new proprietary process involves a lot of time and money, and even more thinking about hops and freshness in new ways. From all of this, we found a brand-spankin'-new way to preserve the hops, fresh from the Yakima Valley trellises, first born during harvest season into the Born Yesterday last fall, and reborn into this scary new next step, the Born Again Yesterday Pale Ale, six months later, to the beer in your hands today.

DeScription

Drawing inspiration from these curious and intrepid voyagers, our brewers have created this rich, robust, deep-flavored ale. Despite its dark coffee-like hue and aromas of bourbon, dark fruit, and chocolate, this ale is deceivingly smooth with a rich malt character and subtly sweet finish. While our drinkers today may not have the same need to stave off scurvy, this hearty ale is one that can be enjoyed today, but also placed in the hold for years to come.

 Stop Making Sense is an Eis Bock. In old German tradition, this style of Lager was developed by  when aging a batch of Doppel Bock in barrels and in caves.
